The fellowship supports a research and training plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Senay Yitbarek is ""Disease evolution: The consequences of spatial structure and co-infection on the evolution of virulence."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of California-Berkeley and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mike Boots.<br/><br/>This research examines how infections of multiple parasites in hosts (co-infections) generates variation and drives disease dynamics at the population level. Classical work describing parasite effects on hosts has focused on single parasite systems. However, co-infections in hosts are ubiquitous in nature, and prior infection by a parasite can determine host response to subsequent invasions by parasites. Parasites that arrive early in a host may have an advantage over late-arriving parasites by occupying niches, or by inducing resistance mechanisms involving immune priming that elicits protection against further attacks. In addition, the spatial structure of hosts modulates the spread, impact and evolution of infectious diseases. The Fellow is testing the hypothesis that the spatial structure of host populations mediates co-infection and favors low parasite virulence. To address the ecological and epidemiological effects of co-infection on virulence evolution, the Fellow is focusing on interactions between the granulosis virus (PiGV) and the bacterial pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in the insect host population of Plodia interpunctella. This well-established infectious disease model system is ideally suited for experimentally evolving hosts and parasites and for examining the evolution of virulence of multiple infections. The Fellow is developing spatially explicit mathematical models of disease transmission involving co-infections from different parasite species, to predict parasite virulence. <br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving training and mentoring in developing theoretical models of evolution, especially as applied to real world problems such as the role of co-evolution in infectious disease dynamics. In an era of increasing global contact networks that promote the spread of novel parasites and emerging infectious diseases, these skills will allow the Fellow to inform policy makers responsible for managing disease risk. The Fellow is partnering with the Biology Scholars Program at UC-Berkeley to mentor underrepresented students, by guiding them in developing independent research projects in host-parasite ecology. In addition, the Fellow is developing short-courses to expose students to hands-on field activities in evolutionary ecology, using inquiry-based learning. These activities increase the participation of underrepresented students in ecology and evolutionary biology, fields that have traditionally lacked diversity."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Michael Landis is ""Modeling ecological niche and geographical range co-evolution in the nightshade family (Solanaceae)."" The host institution for this fellowship is Yale University, and the sponsoring scientist is Michael Donoghue.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to develop a model of geographic range and ecological niche evolution, and apply the model to a family of ecologically diverse and geographically widespread plants, the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Adaptation to novel ecological conditions is common throughout the tree of life, and understanding how, when, and why ecological adaptation occurs has far-reaching applications in areas such as conservation biology, epidemiology, and agricultural science. Because species tend to conserve the ecological niche of their ancestors, and because species adapt to the local conditions found within or abutting their geographical ranges, analyzing this process requires a unified approach that incorporates ecological, geographical, and evolutionary perspectives. Advanced statistical models and inference approaches can be a powerful means of reconstructing evolutionary histories, especially in absence of hard evidence such as fossils. To this end, the Fellow is producing software to estimate how groups of closely related species evolve in response to ecological and geographical factors. Applying the method to environments everywhere from the Atacama Desert to the Tibetan Plateau, the Fellow is characterizing how plants in the Solanaceae family colonized Earth's most extreme environments. To inform the method, the Fellow is developing 'pipeline' tools to integrate molecular, geographical, and ecological data from online biological databases. These data will be supplemented with museum specimens from several major national botanical collections, including the Missouri Botanical Garden, the New York Botanic Garden, and the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Yale Peabody Museum.<br/><br/>The Fellow is gaining valuable experience in conducting empirical research, a significant departure from his dissertation research, which was theoretical and consisted entirely of modeling. By working with the curators and collections of various museums, the Fellow is learning how to diagnose morphological characters using preserved and fossilized specimens. The Fellow is leading workshops in statistical phylogenetics, thereby allowing him improve his teaching skills and develop new collaborations. To advance his mentoring skills, the Fellow is training biology undergraduates through the Yale Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program, focusing on computational and statistical skills. Through community outreach programs, the Fellow is refining his ability to communicate scientific findings in plant evolution to high school students (Yale Science Diplomats) and amateur botanists (Green Café). Software produced during the fellowship is open-source and freely available to the research community."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nathanael Ellis is ""Identifying molecular networks underlying root-root interactions in high plant density adapted maize."" The host institutions for the fellowship are the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the Washington University School of Medicine, and the lead sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christopher Topp, with co-sponsoring scientist Dr. Yuan-Chuan Tai.<br/><br/>Since the 1930's, annual gains in U.S. maize production have largely been driven by the adaptation of maize plants to increasing plant density. Two historically important maize populations, Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic and Corn Borer, have been recurrently selected for increased hybrid grain yield, resulting in density adapted plants. Preliminary work suggests that not only have root architectures changed in these populations, but their sensing and growth responses to neighboring root systems have changed as well, pointing to a new paradigm for understanding the key process of crop density adaptation. This project aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to high plant density in maize roots. Thus the research will contribute to our basic understanding of how roots, the ""hidden-half"" of plants, communicate with one another, and exploit this knowledge for crop improvement. The broader impacts include synergistic training between plant biologists and medical imaging experts, as well as leveraging the project research objectives to develop teaching tools in a classroom experience for underserved students. Training will include: bioinformatics, genomics, advanced image analysis methods, analysis of complex 3D structures, and statistical approaches to quantify the dynamics of plant metabolism.<br/><br/><br/>Shoot architectures, specifically increased leaf angles, are known outcomes of selection during maize density adaptation, but little empirical data exists about the contribution from roots. Selected cycles from progressively density adapted germplasm will be assayed in several ways to quantify root system architecture of plants grown individually or paired, to identify changes in root growth as a function of density adaption. In this project, the effects of density adaptation on 3D root architecture and growth will be assayed by Optical Projection Tomography (OPT), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to study dynamic carbon allocation. These efforts will identify the most relevant time points from which to sample leaf and root tissue for transcriptional profiling, as well as profiling of root exudates via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This project will contribute to modelling the relationship of carbon allocation and root growth in respect to root-root communication and to identify the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling these processes. Results from this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as communicated at scientific conferences. Data will be uploaded to appropriate publicly accessible websites, including the NCBI Sequence Read Archive in association with the maizegdb.org/expression database, as well as the Proteomics Identifications database."

The fellowship supports a professional development plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Allison Fritts-Penniman is 'Understanding the role of ecology in the evolution of high biodiversity on coral reefs.' The host institution for this fellowship is the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Terrence Gosliner.<br/><br/>This project investigates the role of ecology and natural selection in driving the formation of new species, a process known as ecological speciation. Specifically, the Fellow is examining the role corals play in the evolution of nudibranchs, an extremely diverse group of sea slugs found throughout the world's oceans. Coral-feeding nudibranchs, like many marine animals, depend on specific coral species for food and protection. Previous work has shown that new species can evolve through adaptation to life on a different species of coral. The Fellow is integrating geographic, ecological, morphological, and genomic data to evaluate the evolutionary history of all coral-feeding nudibranchs. This will shed light on the importance of coral diversity in producing and maintaining the biodiversity of other organisms, an evolutionary process that is endangered in the face of massive coral die-offs. In addition to improving our understanding of the evolution and taxonomy of this megadiverse group, the Fellow is developing genomic tools to advance future evolutionary studies of nudibranchs and their mollusc relatives. <br/><br/>In terms of training, the Fellow is learning comparative genomic techniques, developing museum collection and curation skills, and advancing her skills in mentoring and science communication. The Fellow is mentoring high school students from groups underrepresented in biology through the CAS Careers in Science (CiS) Internship Program. These students are learning how to study evolution using nudibranchs as a model system, and collaborating with the CAS Teen Advocates for Science Communication to create videos to 1) teach the public about evolution on coral reefs, and 2) show their high school peers that being a scientist is exciting, fun, and achievable regardless of economic or ethnic background. To further engage the general public and augment our knowledge of the biology and natural history of nudibranchs, the Fellow is starting a global nudibranch photo collection project using the iNaturalist platform. iNaturalist is accessible to people on a global scale, including people in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia who do not often have opportunities to contribute to international research."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Matthew A. McCary is ""Understanding how resource subsidies alter aboveground-belowground interactions in different terrestrial ecosystems."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Claudio Gratton, Anthony Ives, and Randall Jackson.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand how resource subsidies from aquatic habitats affect interactions between aboveground and belowground communities on land. Resource subsidies, i.e., fluxes of resources to an ecosystem from outside of its boundaries, can have important effects in recipient ecosystems. However, it is unknown how nutrient subsidies affect aboveground-belowground interactions that occur within different types of recipient ecosystems. Because aboveground and belowground communities are intrinsically linked, feedbacks between these two subsystems have major implications for ecosystem dynamics. The Fellow is testing the hypothesis that characteristics of the recipient ecosystem, particularly plant productivity and structure, will influence how resource subsidies alter aboveground-belowground interactions.  The study system, Lake Mývatn in northeastern Iceland, is known for its high rate of production of aquatic insects (midges), which emerge, mate and die on land, thereby providing a resource subsidy to the surrounding terrestrial landscape. Because resource subsidies are widespread, testing this hypothesis is critical to building a general theory of ecosystem structure and functioning. The Fellow is pursuing two objectives: (1) to determine how the structure of recipient plant communities directs midge resources to either the aboveground or belowground food web; and (2) to compare the subsequent changes to aboveground-belowground interactions once resource subsidies have entered the detritus-based food web in recipient ecosystems of low versus high plant productivity. <br/><br/>The Fellow is being trained to master techniques in plant ecology, food-web interactions, and statistical modeling to evaluate ecosystem-level processes. The Fellow is broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by recruiting Native American, African American, and Hispanic students via an undergraduate Summer Research Internship program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) that specifically supports research experiences for undergraduate students in Iceland. Furthermore, the fellow will re-start UW's dormant chapter of SEEDS (the Ecological Society of America's Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability), a program to stimulate involvement of underrepresented students (particularly undergraduates) in ecological research."

Likewise, a fundamental understanding of the nonlinear response of highly deformable structures and materials is important, for example, in the design of sensors as well as for many other engineering applications. The research aims to provide new classes of continuum-mechanical models and novel approaches to their mathematical analysis, leading to a quantitative understanding of the behavior of such systems.<br/><br/>This project centers on the modeling, computation, and analysis of highly deformable, thin elastic structures and solids. In particular, classes of problems for incompressible solids, thin elastic surfaces, two-phase lipid-bilayer vesicles, and generalized rod models will be addressed. The main goals of the work are: (i) to provide new classes of continuum-mechanics-based models, (ii) to systematically find global equilibria as loading and other parameters vary and assess their stability (local energy minima), and (iii) to identify new phenomena. Goal (ii) entails rigorous existence results as well as systematic numerical computation. In particular, the former will entail addressing new questions in both partial differential equations and the calculus of variations. Goals (i) and (ii) inform and enrich the other; goal (iii) is enabled by goals (i) and (ii). The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and perspectives from several fields, including nonlinear continuum mechanics, biophysics, materials science, nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations, numerical methods, and symmetry ideas."

While basalt represents only ~5% of the crustal rocks exposed at the Earth's surface, basalt weathering may have a disproportionately large effect on long-term climate change because Calcium-bearing silicate minerals composing basalt appear to dissolve easily, thereby consuming atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) at a relatively rapid rate. Several studies have examined basalt weathering in Iceland. A major assumption is that all of the riverine Calcium (Ca)and carbonate alkalinity originates from silicate weathering. However, hydrothermal calcite occurs throughout Iceland, and even trace levels are expected to impact river geochemistry owing to the mineral's high solubility and fast dissolution rate. Understanding the role of hydrothermal calcite weathering has several implications for quantifying the strength of the basalt weathering feedback and the factors that appear to control it, such as runoff, temperature, and mechanical erosion. The project will foster a new international partnership with Icelandic researchers and students. The investigator will supervise research by graduate and undergraduate students, and he will incorporate project findings into his radiogenic isotope geochemistry course. The investigator and his students will engage K12 underrepresented minorities in education and outreach activities related to the project award. The project will benefit society by providing new insight into the long-term carbon cycle and related geochemical phenomena that explain why the Earth is a habitable planet.<br/><br/>This project will test several hypotheses surrounding controls on the Ca isotope composition of Icelandic rivers, which in turn can provide insight into sources of riverine alkalinity and from there, the impact of basalt weathering on long-term atmospheric CO2 levels. The research will also include analyses of radiogenic and stable Strontium (Sr) isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr and &#948;88/86Sr), which should provide additional constraints on the sources and cycling of riverine Ca. Fieldwork conducted during the spring, summer, and fall will mostly concentrate on the Skagafjördur Valley in northern Iceland. Investigators will collect river water, spring water (thermal and non-thermal), rocks, minerals, soils, and plants. They also plan to collect rock and mineral specimens from the Berufjördur region in eastern Iceland. Calcite and the zeolite mineral heulandite form during burial metamorphism of basalt in the deep lava pile and often occur together in metabasalts now exposed at the surface. Heulandite Ca isotope values are lower than those for bulk basalt, while calcite Ca isotope values are higher. The Ca isotope composition of heulandite likely reflects the preferential incorporation of 40Ca during equilibrium isotope exchange at hydrothermal temperatures, implying that the residual 44Ca-enriched waters determine the high Ca isotope values of calcite. To test this hypothesis, the proposed study also includes bench-scale experiments designed to quantify the heulandite Ca isotope fractionation factor under a range of physicochemical conditions. The project is potentially transformative because it will test a long-standing paradigm surrounding the role of basalt weathering in long-term climate regulation. Because zeolite facies metamorphism and hydrothermal fluid circulation are ubiquitous characteristics of basaltic eruptions, findings for Iceland may apply generally to other flood basalt provinces. The research will also advance novel double-spike TIMS methods for measuring Ca isotopes and Sr isotope values recently developed by this group."

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Caitlin Fong is ""Resistance and Resilience of Turf Communities to Pressed and Pulsed Subsidies?. The host institution for this fellowship is California State University Northridge (CSUN), and the sponsoring scientist is Robert Carpenter. <br/><br/>This research explores the consequences of resource subsidies for coral reefs. Resource subsidies, an addition of a resource to an ecosystem from outside its boundaries, have important influences on ecological systems, and mounting evidence suggests that human activities are increasingly influencing resource subsidies. Resources subsidies vary widely in magnitude, duration, and frequency; the pattern, or subsidy regime, can range from pulses (low frequency, high magnitude) to presses (high frequency, low magnitude). It has been proposed that increasing subsidies of nitrogen and sediment, in conjunction with reduced herbivory, cause shifts in coral reef communities from a dominance of corals to dominance by macroalgae. The Fellow is characterizing the nutrient and sediment subsidy regime of a fringing reef in French Polynesia, and quantifying the effects of the subsidies on benthic organisms. The Fellow is testing the hypothesis that nitrogen availability and sediment load are characterized by a pulse-press regime, are increased with rainfall events, and attenuate with distance from the source stream.  The Fellow is also using lab and field assays to test the hypothesis that algal species have individual responses to press versus pulse nutrient and sediment subsidies and different resistance to herbivores that can be characterized by trade-offs.  Finally, the Fellow is conducting a field experiment to test the hypothesis that the subsidy regimes of nitrogen and sediments interact with each other and with herbivory to drive shifts in benthic organisms. <br/><br/>CSUN is an official minority serving (MSI) and Hispanic serving (HSI) intuition, and 51% of the students are self-described minorities, which facilitates the Fellow?s efforts to broaden the participation of under-represented groups.

Additionally, the Fellow is offering a workshop for graduates students entitled ?Develop Your Outreach? to develop research modules or teachable units aimed at exposing and involving underrepresented groups in science.  Finally, the Fellow is sharing her research through online platforms, including: 1) publishing research updates on her personal website, 2) publishing updates called ?A Day in the Life of a Marine Ecologist?, 3) creating videos of fieldwork to provide a virtual field experience to students, and 4) using Twitter and Instagram accounts to provide updates on research."

The host institution for this fellowship is North Carolina State University, and the sponsoring scientist is Reade Roberts.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to elucidate the role of genome-wide epigenetic changes in the determination of gender. Genetic and environmental triggers can affect the developmental processes that produce distinct males and females. In particular, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression and provide organisms with the ability to integrate genomic and environmental information. While epigenetic regulation is implicated in gender-specific organ development, it remains unknown if that regulation ultimately influences whether an individual is male or female, or if it stems from genes. This study will provide a genome-wide assay of epigenetic changes, assessing different genomic regions, tissue types, and gender-specific phenotypic traits, using the fish species Astatotilapia burtoni. This species has multiple genes determining male versus female developmental patterns, resulting in four gender-specific genotypes and two phenotypes (male and female). By identifying histone marks across the genome, the Fellow is determining if the epigenome is shaped by simply being male versus female or by genders-specifying genes. The Fellow is also testing how variation in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms is related to gene expression differences. This study is generating the first epigenome of A. burtoni, an ideal study system for ongoing and future ecological and evolutionary studies. This research is contributing genome resources to the scientific community for broad comparative work of male versus female determination, epigenetics, and gene regulation/expression.<br/><br/>The training and career advancement activities of this project are preparing the Fellow for a research career merging the areas of phenotypic variation and genomics, by providing her with experiences that blend advanced sequencing methodologies with evolutionary and functional hypothesis testing.

The Fellow is conveying her research findings to the community via outreach activities at local colleges (Meredith College, a women's college, and Shaw University, a historically black college), public events, and at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. These experiences are developing the Fellow's ability to communicate to the general public about how and why scientists study genetics. Additionally, the Fellow is integrating her research activities into science education via the Kenan Fellows Program at NC State, a professional advancement program that provides K-12 teachers with mentored research. During summers, the Fellow works closely with a teacher to develop a lesson plan for state schools, and the educational materials generated from these lesson plans are being made online. Outreach activities involving the Kenan Fellows Program and NC Museum of Natural Sciences broadly serve the region, including the rapidly growing population of ethnic minorities in North Carolina."

The program supports two cohorts consisting of a group of four students together with a pair of faculty who have complementary research programs.  Over the course of the summer, each group will progress from teaching/learning new topics in mathematics or statistics, to developing questions and conjectures, to proving results as part of an authentic research experience. Since faculty have distinct but related research interests, they are able to model supportive scientific collaboration for the students and discuss technical topics from different points of view.  The program will produce original research that is disseminated in peer-reviewed journal articles and talks at national, regional, and local professional meetings.<br/><br/>Our faculty are well proportioned between mathematics, applied mathematics, and statistics.  We leverage this breadth to produce REU problems that lie on the intersection of two domains of knowledge, in which both faculty members are likely to be able to make significant contributions.  The intradisciplinary nature of the teams supports the student experience by putting the mentors on similar footing as the students insofar as each mentor will likely be teaching and learning something new. This interaction helps lower the barrier for student collaboration and increases intellectual risk-taking across the entire group, particularly in the initial stages of research.  It also immediately creates a group with a cohesive intellectual culture for students to interact in, both academically and socially.  Each group of students will complete the summer with a mathematical research presentation to faculty and peers. They will also be well prepared and strongly encouraged to present at local, regional and national meetings after the completion of the program.

Specialized pathogens have evolved suites of molecules called effectors that modulate host cell physiology and support parasitism. Over the past decades, a plethora of literature has documented the molecular mechanisms that underlie the induction of effective immune responses and subversion of effector-mediated host defenses. However, a key unresolved question is how pathogens alter cellular metabolism, including manipulation of the source-sink relationships, to acquire nutrients. This interdisciplinary project extends significantly beyond wet-lab techniques by integrating both biology and the rapidly evolving field of computer science for the advancement of research, education, and community-based scientific engagement. Mechanistic understanding of effector-mediated perturbations to mobilize sugars from the central vacuole will be pursued. Elucidating how pathogen infection modulates the global transcriptional dynamics and alters the flow of biological information is of prime focus. Equally paramount, cross-talk between metabolic, hormonal, circadian and immune signaling pathways, involving signals from pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial strains, will be revealed. Situated in the heart of Alabama, at a nationally recognized university for diversity, this project's scope extends into educational avenues as students in advanced level genomics courses will gain experience with relevant bioinformatic analyses, urban high school teachers in the PI's-led BioTeach program will gain exposure to the genetic innovations of today, and zealous recruiting efforts will seek to engage neighboring HBCU-minority students.<br/><br/>The central framework of this proposal, understanding how plant pathogens acquire sugars through the virulence activities of their effectors, presents a substantial advancement over the previously limiting dimensions of a one pathogen: one protein analysis approach. Specifically, this project is focused on a pathogen effector, HopD1, that physically interacts with a set of host proteins forming a functional module, termed 'vacuolar invertase (Vac-INV) module.' The mechanisms by which HopD1 perturbs the Vac-INV module to mobilize sugars stored in the central vacuole while slowing down the resorption  of apoplastic sugars into the host cell will be investigated. HopD1's immune response suppression through interference of a conserved aquaporin-mediated stomatal regulation mechanism will also be investigated. Based on the in silico modeling of Vac-INV?dependent transcriptional circuits, a high resolution global dynamic transcriptional regulatory network in plant-pathogen interactions will also also constructed. Having already developed a web-based interface, OOCEAN, for promoter and bioinformatics analyses, this project will continue to extend its utility in the fast-evolving world of Systems Biology. Novel network biology-based analyses will help obtain a broad understanding of how single effectors simultaneously target different branches of plant immunity and metabolism for the pathogen's advantage. This work will also result in a system that can be applied to other important questions pertaining to plant defense and metabolism as well. Collectively, this systems-level project will solidify global understanding of effector-host interactions, effector-mediated perturbations, and subsequently, dynamic transcriptional regulation."

As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels currently threaten the global ecosystem and human well-being, the development of clean-energy technologies is a major societal necessity.  Professor Buhro is providing new methods to prepare more-efficient solar cells and the economical, scalable semiconductor processing required for widespread access to solar electricity.  One aspect of the project is to develop semiconductor-nanocrystal films having optimized structures for charge transport in the solar-absorber layers of solar cells.  This may increase the performance of the cells.  The key to this strategy is the shape of the nanocrystals, which are plate-like or ribbon-like,  and stack together compactly.  These shapes are capable of transporting charge over large distances.  A second aspect of the project is the low-temperature deposition of semiconductor films using solution chemistry.  A major drawback to the wider implementation of solar electricity is the high cost of making the semiconductor components of solar cells by the current gas-phase and vacuum-based technologies.  Professor Buhro is contributing to the development of much more economical solution-based processing methods.  Both aspects of the project rely on so-called ""magic-size semiconductor nanoclusters"" as key chemical intermediates and precursors.  The magic-size nanoclusters are small, discrete molecular units that have the same compositions as the target semiconductor phases, and that produce crystalline semiconductors from solution at low temperatures.  By increasing the ability to transport charge and the economy of semiconductor-film fabrication, this research may have broad societal impact as it promotes the availability and practicality of solar-energy technology.  Additionally, Professor Buhro is a mentor to a large number female Ph.D. scientists.  He works to retain women in STEM fields by incorporating active-learning strategies in introductory courses.<br/><br/>In this research project, Professor William Buhro of Washington University in St. Louis is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program to employ stoichiometric magic-size semiconductor nanoclusters and flat (2D), colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals in the advancement of low-temperature, solution-based semiconductor processing and nanocrystal solar cells.  Solid-state quantum-dot (QD) solar cells have emerged as a third-generation photovoltaic technology that promises economical, scalable production, and the necessary solar-conversion performance for real-world application.  Flat (2D) semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum belts and quantum platelets) have optical properties and interfacial characteristics comparable to colloidal quantum dots.  They also have at least one extended length dimension.  Professor Buhro is now investigating their use in nanocrystal solar-absorber layers.  The architectures of 2D-nanocrystal films consist of bundled semi-ordered domains oriented in three dimensions.  The larger lateral nanocrystal dimensions relative to QDs are expected to increase the carrier mean free paths and minimize hopping.  The overall film architecture may provide conduction pathways percolating in all three dimensions. These materials may minimizing carrier recombination and increasing the photon-conversion efficiencies of solar cells.  A second component of this project addresses molecular semiconductor inks.  Ideal molecular inks for semiconductor fabrication should possess stoichiometries matched to the target semiconductor, kinetically labile ligands, and the capacity for low-temperature semiconductor crystallization.  Professor Buhro is investigating the newly isolated, stoichiometric magic-size II-VI nanoclusters for this purpose.  Strategies for employing such nanoclusters as low-temperature precursors to bulk, polycrystalline semiconductor films are under study.  Efforts to complete the structural characterization of these stoichiometric, amine-passivated, magic-size II-VI nanoclusters, and to explore their chemical reactivities and physical properties are also underway.  The research pursued in this project is expected to fundamentally advance semiconductor nanoscience impacting solar-energy technologies.  Additionally, Professor Buhro mentors a large number female Ph.D. scientists, and is working to retain women by incorporating active-learning strategies into introductory STEM courses."

Control over land enables investors to cultivate new commodity crops, deploy new agricultural practices and technologies, and sell output for new uses and in new markets - with associated impacts on food-energy security, human well-being, and ecological processes. The scale and pace of changes in land ownership and access has increased rapidly in lower-income tropical countries. The project will assess outcomes of land transactions in Ethiopia - a country that has witnessed thousands of transactions and has substantial external investment, including from the United States - to identify when land transactions generate positive versus negative outcomes. This research will focus in particular on agricultural, ecological, and food and energy security outcomes. The project will generate new data that will be available for public use by other scholars and researchers, train scientists in the United States and build greater research capacity among international collaborators, and produce findings that will hold practical interest for decision makers in government agencies, NGOs, and donor organizations. Generalizable propositions about the impacts of land tenure changes on farm level processes, producer incentives, and labor practices will be of interest to US investors in other regions. <br/><br/>The project will focus in particular on quantifying the nature and extent of socioeconomic, land cover/change and ecological impacts, and modeling the causal sequences and feedback loops of land transactions. The research will advance the conceptual understanding of how tenure and institutional changes on land drive human-nature interactions and impacts in coupled agro-ecological systems. The project will aggregate and leverage existing socioeconomic datasets, and collect original social and ecological data from eight transaction sites. The research will contribute in three major ways towards an improved understanding of the effects of land transactions and the social and ecological effects of land tenure changes. It will: (1) Develop new theoretical insights into the livelihood, land use, and ecological effects of land tenure changes and displacement through integration, quantitative analyses, and agent based modeling based on multi-level social, economic, ecological, and biophysical data; (2) Enhance existing methods to understand and detect changes in land cover using remote sensing data for both agricultural and forest landscapes, particularly for the drier eastern African region; and (3) Improve statistical analysis and computer simulations-based predictions, in particular by developing better spatial analysis techniques. Overall, the project will show how varying patterns of livelihood and land cover changes result from land transition pathways associated with land transactions."

The new approach advanced by this work, Incremental Verification-Validation, enables programmers to bring domain-specific safely disciplines to extensible systems, by providing a framework where these disciplines are communicated both precisely and usefully, as executable code.  The project's broader significance and importance consist in changing the way programmers approach building correct extensible software for the web.

Further, the project represents a new collaboration across the University of Colorado and University of Maryland, bringing together experts across verification, incremental computing, and runtime systems. Finally, this project benefits the graduate and undergraduate teaching mission at the participating universities, as aspects of the project enriches the program analysis and programming language courses.<br/><br/>Incremental Verification-Validation encourages programmers to co-design their systems with executable specifications that check these systems dynamically, as they execute. Moreover, unlike typical assertions, which execute dynamically and non-incrementally, the proposed  are subject to novel patterns that enhance their performance: In regressive validation, verification partially discharges some checks, dynamically rewriting the program with residual versions; in progressive verification, online verification occurs in passes that each cache and reuse work, to avoid from-scratch verification of facts that still hold from earlier passes. Finally, to avoid forcing analysis programmers to reason about incremental changes explicitly in each analysis that they create, the meta layer expresses incremental computations implicitly, using an implicitly-incremental meta language whose abstractions hide reasoning on a per-change basis."

While natural ventilation has been used for thousands of years in various culture worldwide, the current modern method of designing for natural ventilation is simplistic and assumes steady flow, thus misestimating actual natural ventilation rates and their associated energy and indoor air quality impacts. The key reason behind such difficulty is the inherent unsteadiness of the wind in both its direction and magnitude. Unlike mechanical ventilation, which is driven by fans with well-tuned control, the wind's effect on ventilation is wholly unpredictable given the current approach. Such lack of knowledge may result in unintended consequences in energy consumption, human comfort, and even the overall health and wellbeing of the occupants. To better understand the consequences on building airflow and occupants of wind variability, this research project will analyze quantitatively, for different building forms and locales, the impacts of wind-driven natural ventilation flow in terms of ventilation effectiveness, energy consequences, and indoor air quality.<br/><br/>These goals of the research project will be accomplished by: 1) Researching the ideal formulation of a probabilistic transient wind effect framework that describes wind's variable impacts on buildings, as well as researching what minimum time scale that metric should operate on; 2) Simulating wind-building interactions in the nine National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established climate zones in the contiguous United States for a selections of building types from Department of Energy's representative building stock in the U.S., using both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and quasi-steady state approximations; 3) Investigating a broad spectrum of factors of the impact of the framework, such as ventilation effectiveness, energy impacts, and indoor air quality and occupant productivity and health. The research is anticipated to impact the building design process by allowing engineers to properly design for the wind harnessing potential, rather than considering natural ventilation solutions as an afterthought as in most existing building designs.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to William R. Kuhn is ""Leveraging face-detection methods to identify insects from field photos, automatically."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mongi Abidi.  <br/><br/>This work aims to automate the identification of species, thereby helping to alleviate the 'taxonomic impediment,' i.e., an urgent need for more taxonomy from fewer taxonomists. The impetus for doing this research is that although understanding Earth's species is one of the grand challenges of the twenty-first century, training and funding for the field of taxonomy (identifying and describing species) has declined markedly over the past several decades. The Fellow is integrating existing computer vision and machine-learning methods to build an automatic system for identifying species from photographs of them in their habitat.  The Fellow has three main research objectives: (1) develop and train a model to locate the subjects in images by modifying an existing method for detecting human faces in photographs; (2) characterize the images based on the appearance of the subjects' body parts by adapting an algorithm for describing the key features of an image; and (3) predict species identity by comparing features from unknown images to those of known species, utilizing a robust machine-learning framework. The Fellow is developing a system to identify dragonfly and damselfly (Odonata) species, but the underlying code will allow researchers to train systems for other organisms. The Fellow is utilizing citizen scientist data on OdonataCentral (odonatacentral.org), a digital collection of species records and imagery of Odonata from the Western Hemisphere. Images of the 600+ species included in this digital collection are being used to train the most taxonomically-broad automatic identification system ever created, and the ability of this software to accept field-based images makes it extremely versatile.<br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving advanced training in image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning, and becoming proficient in software design and programming. The Fellow will be able use these skills to solve problems in biology in the future, when he is running his own lab. The Fellow is also developing his skills as a mentor and scientific communicator. He is mentoring two undergraduates and one graduate student in computer science, encouraging them to focus on solving biological problems. The odonate identification system is being integrated into OdonataCentral as well the mobile app that it powers, Dragonfly ID. This will allows both researchers and citizen scientists to make rapid identifications in the field, for applications such as assessing biodiversity and monitoring water quality. Ultimately this research will benefit taxonomists studying other organisms, since the Fellow is releasing his source code, allowing others to train and implement their own automatic identification systems."

It is the primary method that North American archaeologists use, and millions of dollars in federal and other funding has been spent in obtaining thousands of such dates from archaeological sites. Researchers around the world now use the changing abundance of radiocarbon dates as a way to reconstruct population histories over time, and thus to provide an important piece of human history:  where and when did populations rise and decline?  How fast? How does population change relate to climate change, technological innovation, population density, subsistence, warfare, and emigration, social and political organization?  This project has already compiled dates from the 11 western U.S. states (35,000+); it will now move on to compile dates from the 11 plains states.  It is not only the dates themselves that are compiled, but also associated contextual information that researchers need to ""clean"" the database to create a sample useful for their specific research questions.  The data will become publically and freely available through the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database, a large and growing international radiocarbon database. It will provide researchers with a useful tool to investigate research questions in several disciplines including archaeology, paleontology, and genetics, and help move North American archaeology toward its next frontier, ""Big Data,"" since archaeology's strength is its ability to test hypotheses against patterns in data across vast reaches of space and time.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the question of prehistoric rates of population growth and, contrary to received wisdom, has already discovered that the long-term rates of growth of agricultural populations are the same as earlier hunting and gathering populations. If this discovery stands, it implies that the only significant change in human demographic history occurred in the nineteenth century, when technological advances in food production and trade coupled with advances in medical knowledge dramatically increased the rate of population growth.  In other words, rapid population growth is only a feature of modern human life.  To achieve this goal the project is investigating the ""best practices"" of statistical analysis of large samples of radiocarbon dates. Rises and declines in the number of dates per unit time is assumed to track similar rises and declines in human population. There is reason to be cautious as there are several variables that could modify if not negate this assumed relationship, for example, research bias, the systematic loss of dates over time due to preservation , and the effects of the standard procedure used to convert radiocarbon ages in familiar calendar dates."

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Brandon P. Hedrick is ""The Evolution of Forelimb Strength in Mammals and Birds."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Elizabeth Dumont.  <br/><br/>The Fellow is exploring linkages between functional morphology, ecological niche occupation, and evolutionary diversification in birds and mammals. To accomplish this, the Fellow is examining bone structure and geometry across six evolutionary transitions from weaker forelimbs to more powerful forelimbs in mammals and birds. For example, transitions include those between bats, which have strong forelimbs for flight, and their close relatives, which have relatively weaker forelimbs. Using these data, the Fellow is (1) determining if there are convergences across these transitions, and (2) evaluating whether there are significant increases in rates of speciation associated with these transitions. The occurrence of shifts in speciation rates would demonstrate that the evolution of powerful forelimbs entailed a substantial adaptive advantage. The recurrence of the same morphological changes across each transition would imply that increased forelimb strength is achieved through common, fundamental mechanisms. <br/><br/>The Fellow?s training includes learning micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) data collection and manipulation, comparative phylogenetic methods, and approaches for evaluation of rates of evolution and speciation. As one goal of the Fellow?s research is to better understand the evolution of bat flight, the Fellow is building bat houses to encourage bat colonization, on grounds maintained by the Hitchcock Center for the Environment, a local conservation center in Amherst, MA. The Fellow employs this method as a means to promote bat welfare, and stimulate interest among both students and members of the local community in conserving and protecting bats. The Fellow is also delivering lectures about his research to the public through multiple venues and to undergraduates at UMass Amherst through university programs and guest lectures. Finally, the Fellow is mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and immersing them in the data collection and analysis portions of this project. The training, outreach and mentoring activities are enhancing the development of the Fellow?s teaching skills as a means of preparing him for a successful career in academia."

The research extends to related models such as a class of active scalar equations that arises in the geophysical fluid dynamics.  Here, the main aim is to investigate ill/well-posedness phenomena of nonlinear problems, where the nonlinearity is based on even or singular symbols, additionally equipped with some intrinsic anisotropy.  The project concerns furthermore the problem of uniqueness of solutions to the primitive equation of the ocean.

This project will study how concepts are generalized from individual examples, thus continuing to inform the cognitive science literature on this topic. The experiments will present students with multiple examples of science concepts according to different timing patterns so that students can abstract similarities and differences among them. The studies will directly address a seemingly paradoxical set of findings: presenting examples at the same time and apart in time have both been shown to promote science learning. As such, this work will resolve conflicting findings in cognitive science and science education and, in turn, will generate a body of research that elucidates fruitful methods for designing learning environments. The long-term goal of this work is to provide STEM educators with educative curricular material supplements that outline the timing patterns that promote students' learning outcomes. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>A series of experiments will test conflicting but possibly mutually informing hypotheses. One line of research in cognitive science has proposed that presenting examples of science concepts simultaneously promotes students' abstraction and immediate generalization of concepts. However, another line of work has argued that spacing presentations across time promotes students' abstraction and long-term generalization of concepts. The current work bridges these two lines of research by examining the conditions under which simultaneous and spaced presentations promote students' generalization. The central hypothesis in this work is that developmental changes in students' cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory, and science knowledge, will create shifts in which presentation schedule promotes their generalization of concepts. The results of this work will generate a cognitive model of how presentation timing impacts students' science learning. This cognitive model will allow researchers and STEM educators to make predictions about the presentation timing that will best promote students' acquisition and generalization of science concepts."

Galaxies like our own Milky Way are vast collections of hundreds of billions of stars orbiting in a disk perhaps 100,000 light-years in diameter.  Lurking in the centers of many and perhaps all galaxies are supermassive black holes?mysterious objects containing millions or billions of times as much mass as our own Sun, but crammed into a volume that would fit easily within the inner solar system.  In the past few years, astronomers have discovered luminous flares emanating from the core regions of nearby galaxies.  These are thought to originate from the disruption of individual stars that were orbiting so close to the black hole that they were ripped apart by its strong gravitational force.  The energy emitted as the remains of the star fall into the black hole produces the luminous flare.  The collaborators on this project will carry out detailed numerical modeling of these events and will make publicly available their computer codes.  The collaborators also plan to make their work accessible to a wide audience by teaming experts with students in the visual arts and digital media to produce visual simulations of great power and beauty.  In addition, they will participate in a strong program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>2.	Over the past several years, wide-field transient surveys have begun to deliver more and better data about tidal disruption events (TDEs).  A TDE is produced when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the core of a galaxy.  Because the theoretical understanding of such events remains incomplete, the collaborators will bring together experts in numerical hydrodynamics and non-equilibrium radiative transfer to study how matter from the tidally disrupted star loses kinetic energy and accretes onto the SMBH, identify the radiative processes that generate the X-ray/ultraviolet/optical spectra and light curves of TDEs, develop a numerical toolset to be used in analyzing TDEs, and apply it to constrain the properties of the star and the SMBH in observed events.  For TDEs with well-resolved light curves, their models will enable a better characterization of the SMBHs and the dense stellar clusters that surround them.  Building upon existing strengths of the partner institutions, the collaborators will also cross-fertilize the training of computational scientists and students in the visual arts and digital media using state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations as common ground.  The resulting visual products will be used to disseminate the results, help to inform the general public about science and the universe, and provide raw material for science curricula, documentaries, and astronomy presentations.  The investigators will also continue their program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups."

This project is developing methods to use light as an energy source to drive placement of metal contacts on heat-sensitive materials.

The reliable formation of stable metallic contacts to organic thin films is critical to many technologies from energy harvesting to sensing to organic/molecular electronics.  The development of photoassisted low temperature CVD will advance the state-of-the-art in organic electronics by enabling the integration of molecular assemblies into complex devices.  In this collaborative project, design and synthesis of ruthenium, platinum and gold complexes as photosensitive CVD precursors is followed by a screening process involving identification of the primary photoprocess, determination of the quantum yield for ligand loss, elucidation of thermal decomposition steps, and modeling reactivity with functional groups on the substrate surface.  Promising precursor complexes are subjected to photolytic chemical vapor deposition experiments with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as model substrate systems.  SAMs are used as the substrates because they have highly organized structures with a uniform density of terminal organic functional groups that will allow the quantitative investigation of the precursor-molecule interactions. Further, SAMs can be easily patterned to produce multifunctional surfaces, which are used to determine the selectivity of the deposition reactions."

Students involved in this project present their work at scientific meetings and publish papers in peer reviewed journals.

In this technique, electrons are used to induce local decomposition of organometallic precursors adsorbed onto solid substrates in a vacuum environment. FEBID combines the advantages of direct-write lithographic processes (e.g., high spatial resolution, site-specificity, mask-less, resist-less) with the flexibility to deposit materials on non-planar surfaces, allowing creation of spatially and geometrically well-defined three-dimensional, metal-containing nanostructures. For FEBID to emerge as a broadly applicable nanofabrication technique, however, control must be exerted over not just the size and shape, but also the chemical composition of the nanostructures. The current practice is to use precursors designed for thermal processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These CVD precursors generally create FEBID deposits with high levels of organic contamination, limiting potential applications. This project is addressing the issue of contamination in FEBID materials.  This research synthesizes and evaluates new organometallic precursors designed specifically for FEBID.  The efforts are guided by mechanistic insights from surface science.  They are also improved by developing new purification strategies for FEBID nanostructures. The results are improving the understanding of FEBID by generating detailed mechanistic information on the electron-molecule reactions. Careful design of the reaction chemistry allows control of the purity while the ability to focus electron beams allows control of the size and shape of the metal structure in a process analogous to 3D printing of plastic objects."

In the big data era, high dimensional data arise frequently.  Model selection in the presence of high dimensional features in the framework of linear models, generalized linear models, and models with censored data has been a very active area of research in recent years.  The PI aims to develop new algorithms for model selection, within a Bayesian computational framework, that are scalable for high dimensional problems.  The PI motivates the proposed research through collaborations with scientists in atmospheric sciences, genetics, and kinesiology, and aims to develop methodologies that are broadly applicable in statistical modeling and data analysis.  <br/> <br/>Much of the recent work has focused on shrinkage through penalization or regularization.  Bayesian computational methods, when interpreted broadly, play a valuable role in statistics, including model selection and estimation, but face important hurdles in high dimensional statistics, both in theoretical intricacy and in computational scalability.  The PI aims to develop a theoretical framework to demonstrate model selection consistency from the frequentist perspective, which offers interesting insights into why Bayesian model selection methods can provide an asymptotic approximation to the L0 penalty. An important part of the proposed work is the development of a modified Gibbs sampler in the selection of sparse models that is much more scalable than standard MCMC algorithms in the presence of high dimensional variables. The Bayesian methods are especially useful in problems with non-convex objective functions, where Bayesian computation methods can be more robust in performance than direct optimization. A primary application of such a problem considered in the project is quantile regression for censored data. In addition to model selection, the PI proposes a new estimation method for censored quantile regression that promises to be computationally and statistically efficient. Equally importantly, the new method adapts easily to general forms of censoring that other estimation methods have found difficult to handle. The PI will continue integrating research with education by working with PhD students and by providing research experiences for undergraduate students. The research output will be properly disseminated through conferences and workshops and through publication in widely read journals in statistical science."

Recent advancements in fiber production techniques have facilitated new applications for advanced fibrous materials in diverse fields, such as optoelectronics, regenerative medicine, piezoelectrics, ceramics, etc. With these advanced applications, a need exists to develop techniques to produce a wider range of fibrous materials with high performance and multifunctional capabilities. Reactive fiber spinning is a solvent-free, low-energy technique that presents an attractive alternative to melt-blowing and electrospinning for large-scale production of polymer fibers. The proposed research aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the reactive fiber spinning process by studying the interactions between various process parameters and the fundamental mechanisms that control fiber formation and properties.<br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from nature, the Ellison group recently developed a method for making fibers that uses light to trigger a photopolymerization reaction in nonvolatile liquid monomer mixtures that are already prevalent and commercially available in industry. Extrusion of the nonvolatile liquid monomer mixtures through a capillary at high speed is followed by the application of a drawing force and simultaneous photocuring in flight, producing solid smooth fibers with average diameters as small as 1 micron. These fibers are competitive with the smallest fibers produced by almost all commercial melt blowing lines, the most popular commercial process for manufacturing thermoplastic nonwoven fibers. The proposed research will investigate the interactions between various process and monomer mixture parameters to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to fiber formation, and control morphological variations and properties (thermal, mechanical, and structural), during reactive fiber spinning of polymer fibers. The ultimate objective is to develop a predictive and universal process operating diagram that relates curing kinetics, monomer mixture characteristics, and process related parameters.  <br/><br/>The proposed reactive fiber spinning technique has significant potential impact related to green chemistry and sustainable manufacturing of polymer fibers. The PI proposes a strong outreach program that pairs graduate students with high-school teachers (Teaching Fellows) to jointly conduct research and develop high-school curricula. The proposed research will benefit from the teacher participants, while the teachers will become advocates of science and engineering program to K-12 students.   The development of interactive modules and participation in programs, such as Explore UT and Introduce a Girl to Engineering, will enable the PI and his graduate students to engage and educate a broad cross-section of K-12 students and the general public about modern polymeric materials."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Shanadeen Begay is ""Enzyme Design Principles for Elucidating Enzyme Function.""  The host sponsoring scientists are all at Northeastern University (NU): Drs. Mary Jo Ondrechen, Lee Makowski, and Penny J. Beuning.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the role of distal amino acids in the structure and function of enzymes. Understanding the functional roles of all amino acids in a protein structure, including distal amino acids about which little is currently known, is key to understanding protein structure and moving forward the new field of enzyme design. However, there does not exist a natural enzyme that can act as a catalyst for most synthetic reactions, and it remains a major challenge to develop the capability to design such enzymes. The Fellow is exploring the contribution of distal amino acids to: 1) the electrical potential in the active site; and 2) the dynamic motion, of the human enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). The Fellow is also developing computational tools that will integrate x-ray solution scattering data with computed molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to enhance the understanding of the role of dynamics in enzyme catalysis.  The results will inform the biological community of the importance of distal residues in enzyme function and design, and help to develop the basic principles to enable enzyme design. <br/><br/>The Fellow is engaged in several training activities in areas such as: 1) protein expression and purification techniques; 2) quantum mechanical molecular electronic structure calculations and protein electrostatics computational methods; and 3) x-ray solution scattering techniques for protein solution structure determination. The Fellow is increasing the participation of under-represented groups, specifically promoting the inclusion of Native Americans in the sciences, by participating in an NSF-sponsored future faculty development program administered by the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) entitled 'Lighting the Pathway to Faculty Careers for Natives in STEM.' The Fellow also serves as a role model and mentor to dozens of undergraduate STEM majors, and is helping promote careers in biology to minorities served by the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) institutions. Further benefits to society will result from the Fellow's outreach efforts to broaden the participation in biology of K-12 students at the North American Indian Center of Boston (NAICOB)."

One approach to reduce carbon dioxide emission from fossil-fuel powered vehicles is to increase their fuel efficiency by reducing the vehicle structural weight. To that end, Mg alloys demonstrate a favorable strength-to-weight ratio and provide valid alternatives to aluminum alloys and high strength steels. Thus, there is a growing interest in utilizing Mg alloys in many automotive, aerospace and defense applications. However, at present, one of the limiting factors for the wide production and use of Mg alloys is their low formability at room temperature, which leads to many technological and economical constraints. This is mainly due to the low ductility of Mg alloys at room temperature. As such, most Mg sheets are formed at elevated temperatures below their recrystallization limit (~400ºC). Another challenge is the high strain-rate sensitivity of Mg, which necessitates low speed forming processes. This award will thus supports research to fundamentally identify the deformation mechanisms through a set of state-of-the-art multi-length scale experimental and simulation techniques. The results of this project are expected to assist in the process of developing new Mg alloys that demonstrate improved formability and enhanced ductility and toughness at a wider range of temperatures and strain rates. The integration of research, education and outreach in this project will also: (1) improve STEM achievement in a predominately African American elementary school in Baltimore, currently ranked below 92% of schools in Maryland; (2) involve under-represented students from a local historically black college through internships on research in mechanics and materials; and (3) develop an education portfolio that intensifies the knowledge of undergraduate and graduate students in fundamentals of state-of-the-art multiscale modeling and micro-scale experiments.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>The primary research objectives of this research are to fundamentally identify the coupled strain rate effect and thermo-mechanical response of Mg and AZ31 microcrystals (fabricated in bulk single crystals) through coupled novel in situ scanning electron microscopy elevated-temperature experiments, and novel large scale three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations that account for dislocation-twin boundary interactions. The research hinges around addressing four challenging objectives: (1) Quantify the thermo-mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms in the range of 30 to 400ºC in Mg and AZ31 microcrystals; (2) Identify the origins of the anomalous hardening response observed at 30% of the melting temperature of Mg; (3) Quantify the strain rate effects at different temperatures on the deformation mechanisms in the range of 1e-4 to 0.1 s; and (4)  Generate a four dimensional model of the correlation between temperature, strain rate, crystal size, and strength."

Because the institutional state may be distant from these territories, claims to sovereignty and the right to exert regulatory power often get worked out locally. These evolving relationships raise important questions about the nature of government in the contemporary world and the capacities of communities to establish and evaluate political legitimacy. The research funded by this award addresses these questions by taking advantage of an interesting natural experiment in a coal-mining region in northeastern Colombia. <br/><br/>Vanderbilt University doctoral student Emma Banks, under the supervision of Dr. Lesley Gill, will undertake the research in a frontier region of Colombia that, for over two decades, has been home to a major open pit coalmine.  The mine has displaced communities from their communal rural territories and resettled them in peri-urban villages. Usefully for research purposes, these communities contrast with each other along two significant axes: how recently they have been displaced and whether they are ethnically Afro-descendant or indigenous Indians. Taking advantage of these contrasts, Banks will gather data in four communities that contrast along those lines: two communities resettled earlier, one of each ethnicity; and two resettled more recently, again, once of each ethnicity. This will allow her to see how local political processes evolve over time and how this evolution is affected by the resources accessible by people in different social positions.  Banks will compare the legal resources, ethnic identity politics, and alliance networks used by each community to legitimize authority, make the impacts of resettlement visible, and influence resettlement outcomes.  To find and compare evidence of legitimacy building, she will conduct participant observation at roundtable meetings between the mine and communities, and interview mine officials, state officials, and community members.  To contextualize these findings, she will also carry out archival research and conduct in-depth life history interviews with community members.  These data will allow her to better understand a phenomenon found worldwide, including in the United States: how communities and natural resource corporations, away from the direct government control, negotiate legitimacy and influence each other. Findings from this research will inform social science theory of how local politics functions at the local level in the contemporary world. Findings will also be of use to policy makers who seek to devise ways to support resource extraction without disadvantaging citizens and communities."

These materials have very finely controlled internal structures at the scale of just a few dozen atoms, and show dramatic improvements in strength, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and many other functional properties.  While laboratory work has succeeded in producing small samples of nanocrystalline material, this has not yet translated to commercial-scale production of ""bulk"" alloys, i.e., materials big enough to make engineering componentry from. This project is developing a scientific approach to solve the problem of scalability for these advanced materials.  It explores the science of alloying in nanostructured powders that can be consolidated at high temperatures into bulk components, while still retaining the  nanocrystalline structure. <br/><br/>Scientifically, the project aims to develop a deep understanding of nanocrystalline alloy powders, their structure, and their processability.  The project combines experimental and simulation-based tools, and focuses on a model alloy system based on the metal tungsten, used widely in cutting tools and machining equipment. Technologically, the project will identify alloys and processes that are significantly more cost-effective and energy-efficient than any known today. The broader impact of the proposal thus combines possible commercial advances in premium structural materials, with a wide range of educational benefits in the training of undergraduate and graduate students involved with the project.     <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The proposed work will develop the fundamental physics of a new class of thermodynamically stabilized nanostructured materials, called ""nano-duplex"" alloys, as well as a newly discovered rapid sintering mechanism that can only be induced in this class of nanostructured materials. Because these alloys exhibit the potential for rapid powder consolidation while retaining a stable nanoscale structure, they may hold the key to cost- and energy-efficient, scalable, and broadly commercially applicable synthesis of bulk nanostructured metals. These discoveries enable nanostructured alloys with nanoscale grain sizes that are stable through a full high-temperature consolidation cycle to full density, without the need for applied pressures or fields. <br/><br/>In terms of intelletucal merits, the project will explore this new class of nanostructured alloys and the mechanisms by which they sinter. A systematic experimental study is proposed on the W-Cr system, exploring the role of alloy composition, temperature, impurity content and other processing variables on the mechanisms of densification. Kinetic parameters such as activation energies and activation volumes will be quantified, and compared with observations of microstructure evolution. Additionally, a new kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach will be developed, calibrated, and applied to study the mechanisms of densification and to identify the separate roles of interfaces and nano-scale second phases on sintering. In the out years of the project additional alloying systems will be explored to demonstrate the broader applicability of this sintering mechanism to other technologically relevant alloys that are amenable to powder route production.  In terms of broader impacts, the proposal combines possible commercial advances in advanced structural materials, with a wide range of educational benefits in the training of undergraduate and graduate students on the new sintering method itself as well as on the different characterization and modeling methods that are used in the project."

Many problems, both theoretical and practical, can be abstracted through graphs, and graphs are also used to represent data. Several basic optimization problems on graphs naturally arise in many different contexts, and it is important to build and expand a toolkit of algorithmic ideas and techniques for addressing such problems. This project will focus on two broad classes of graph optimization problems: graph routing and graph sparsification. Graph routing problems are used as abstractions in many applications, for example, when designing VLSI chips, in multi-robot motion planning, and routing traffic across optical networks. Graph sparsification can be a useful tool in analyzing large and complex networks, including social ones, and in designing faster algorithms for a variety of graph problems. Graph routing and sparsification problems were studied in several different areas, such as approximation algorithms, fixed parameter tractability, and graph theory. In addition to designing better algorithms for such problems, another goal of the project is to increase the flow of ideas and collaboration between these different communities, by studying problems lying in the intersection of these areas. The project will involve graduate and possibly undergraduate students from TTIC and University of Chicago, as well as students from other institutions who participate in TTIC's summer internship program. The PI will also participate in activities aimed at increasing the participation of women in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>Typically in a graph routing problem one is given a graph G and a collection of pairs of vertices, called demand pairs, that need to be connected to each other. The goal is to connect as many of the pairs as possible via paths, usually subject to some restrictions on the maximum load on graph vertices or edges. These are fundamental problems that have been studied extensively by both theoretical computer science and graph theory communities. Unfortunately, there are still wide gaps in our understanding of some of the most basic problems in this area, and this project aims to make progress on them. In graph sparsification problems, one is given a graph G and a small set T of its vertices called terminals. The goal is to represent the graph G by a much smaller graph H (called a sparsifier), that approximately preserves the properties of G with respect to T. The specific types of properties one would like to preserve give rise to several types of sparsifiers (for example, we may want to preserve cuts, flows or integral routings between the terminals). Problems in this area naturally connect to approximation algorithms (where sparsifiers can be used to obtain improved approximation factors to various problems), fixed-parameter tractability (where they give a black-box way to design faster algortihms), and to graph theory (many sparsification problems can be cast in graph theoretic terms and have been studied by the graph theory community). There are still many open problems in this area, and this project will attempt to improve the state of the art on several of them."

The obtained atomic-level crystallographic and magnetic structures of these compounds, as well as their dynamical properties, are expected to reveal the specifics of the action of the spin-orbit coupling in these materials.

In this new magnetic liposome structure, gold coated iron oxide nanoparticles will be used as a source of ultrasound for triggering drug delivery in the liposomes. The gold surface of the magnetic particles facilitates a strong attachment of chemical linker via thiol functional groups. The magnetic structures that produce local ultrasonic vibrations are attached to the liposomes via thiolated polyethylene glycol derivatives of cholesterol and phospholipids. As a secondary objective of the proposed research, the PI aims at exploring a potentially more efficient ultrasound generation process from non-spherical magnetic nanorods in rotating magnetic fields. The proposal describes a pulsed magnet capable of mechanically turning colloidal nanostructures. A course-grained molecular dynamics simulation will be developed to provide physical insight into the mechanism of ultrasound generation in colloidal magnetic solutions. It has been found recently that colloidal magnetic nanostructures are able to produce sufficiently large amount of ultrasound that can induce drug release in magneto liposomes from high frequency magnetic fields. The key hypothesis is that once the magnetic particles are moved outside the liposomes structures, one can trigger more efficient drug release, and can carry larger drug delivery capacity from the same sized magneto liposomes when compared to previous designs. It is anticipated that the drug molecules from the liposomes can be released in a very short time (sub millisecond timescale) without significant temperature rise, which will create a new platform for practical delivery of short lived temperature sensitive drug molecules. The proposed work also addresses ultrasound generation in different ways compared to the previous discoveries. It is hypothesized that ultrasound may be generated from anisotropic magnetic nanostructures (nanorods) more effectively in rotating magnetic fields than from spherical magnetic particles in inhomogeneous non-rotating magnetic fields."

Practitioners across the applied sciences and engineering often now resemble mountaineers more than hill-walkers, exploring optimization goals in sharp rather than smooth strategic landscapes. Solving such problems in control engineering, contemporary statistics, or big data applications has had transformative impact. Often lost in the computational fog, however, has been the fundamental geometry underlying this success: mathematical specialists often compute little, and conversely, practitioners across vital science and engineering applications are typically unaware of the fundamentals. This project aims to bridge that divide, developing an innovative mix of geometry and computation. Ph.D. students will be involved in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>The project envisages a unifying mathematical strategy based on two dual but equivalent viewpoints: the geometric idea of partial smoothness and the algorithmic idea of identification. Using the power of modern variational analysis, the project aims to illuminate how partly smooth geometry encourages solutions with desirable structure (like sparsity or low rank), how popular contemporary algorithms are hence drawn to (or ""identify"") such solutions, how fast the methods therefore converge, and how we might accelerate them. In the project's spotlight are two motivating algorithms, both very promising in computational practice. The first, a prox-linear method, solves large-scale structured problems whose explicit partly smooth geometry it could potentially exploit. The second, a smooth quasi-Newton method with robust but baffling success for nonsmooth optimization, is blind to any explicit geometry, but is strongly influenced by it. Crucial to the project's success will be interplay with other areas of classical mathematics; matrix analysis is rich in potential applications -- the project aims in particular at the ""Crouzeix conjecture."" From a foundational perspective, commonly-occurring polynomial inequalities can induce partial smoothness through stratification into smooth surfaces, immersing this project in the fundamentals of semi-algebraic geometry."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Andrew J. MacDonald is ""Land use change and deforestation: A cause and consequence of vector-borne disease risk in the Amazon Basin."" The host institution for this fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Erin Mordecai.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the bi-directional relationship between vector-borne disease and land use change, using malaria and deforestation in the Amazon as a model system. Improved understanding of these relationships is critically important to conservation, economic development and human health. Land use change is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing society. As natural lands are cleared by humans, species reliant on the cleared habitat are lost while other species replace them. There is substantial evidence that arthropod vectors - such as mosquitoes and ticks - and the pathogens they transmit, often benefit from land use change. Yet, studies attempting to link land use change directly to human disease have yielded ambiguous results, often drawing contradictory conclusions. One important source of this ambiguity may be the existence of bi-directional feedbacks between land use change and disease that, if overlooked, can result in unreliable and misleading results. The Fellow is using robust statistical techniques widely applied in empirical economics, and high-resolution environmental and epidemiological data, to develop an understanding of the relationships between land use change and malaria. In so doing, he is helping to develop a general framework to address feedbacks between land use change and infectious disease, thereby contributing greatly to the burgeoning field of disease ecology.<br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving training in advanced statistical and computational modeling, incorporating techniques from econometrics and epidemiology. In addition, the Fellow's research results are being used to develop interactive educational tools and curricula in collaboration with high school teachers from underserved communities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

To do this the PI will focus on the ""glue"" that binds one atom to another to form molecules and materials which has the technical name exchange-correlation energy. Making this energy smaller strengthens the ""glue"" because electrons avoid close approaches to other electrons which have the same electric charge. The density of electrons determines the exchange-correlation energy, but the exact formula is not known. Nevertheless, it is possible to use a computer to predict what molecules and materials can exist, and with what properties, by using an approximate formula. The PI has developed approximate formulas that lead to good predictions of the properties of many materials and molecules as compared with actual experiments. In this research the PI will develop even more accurate approximations for the ""glue"" that still lend themselves to efficient simulation of molecules, and materials on a computer. <br/>The PI's most recent approximate formula is called SCAN. As a feature, it shares all the attributes of the exact formula that are known from fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are possible for an approximation like SCAN. Nevertheless, no formula of this type can be exact; approximations of this type introduce a spurious interaction of an electron with itself. A major goal of this project will be to develop a widely-useful correction to overcome this source of error for SCAN.<br/>The development of more accurate approximations for the ""glue"" that holds atoms together leads to better predictions for the properties of chemicals, molecules, and materials. These predictions can lead to the discovery of new materials with desired properties for a wide range of applications from building and construction, to sophisticated electronic devices, to biomaterials for medical applications, and more.

The theory is exact in principle, although in practice the density functional for the exchange-correlation energy must be approximated. In the preceding award period, the Perdew research group developed SCAN, a ""strongly constrained and appropriately normed"" functional that is more accurate for diversely-bonded systems than comparably-efficient approximations. Satisfying all 17 known exact constraints that a semilocal functional can, the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation could replace the widely-used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation.<br/><br/>In the current award period, extensive tests will be made for SCAN and for SCAN with a long-range van der Waals correction. These tests would include the formation energies which determine relative stabilities of molecules and solids from the elements in their standard states, large reference-data sets for sp-bonded and transition-element-containing molecules, the polyacetylene chain, the ground-state crystal structures of solids that have proven challenging to get correct for , fundamental band gaps of solids, surface energies and work functions of metals, and adsorption energies for molecules on surfaces, A refined self-interaction correction to SCAN would seek to preserve the excellent SCAN description of equilibrium bonds for weakly-correlated systems while improving the description of stretched bonds, charge transfers, and  strongly-correlated systems. A SCAN-like additive correction to the fully-nonlocal random phase approximation would be developed. Proof would be sought for a hypothesized tight lower bound on the exchange energy of any spin-unpolarized density. Finally, exchange-correlation energy differences for selected systems would be analyzed in a way that could lead to a better understanding of electronic systems and their properties, and of the successes of SCAN. The development of more accurate approximations for exchange-correlation functions will result in better predictions for the properties of atoms, molecules, and materials and can lead to the discovery of new materials with desired properties for a wide range of applications from building and construction to sophisticated electronic devices to biomaterials for medical applications and more. This research enables better computer modeling of materials with potential impact on the Materials Genome Initiative.

The fire science community is small, fragmented and geographically dispersed. The present project is an effort to meet the resulting organizational challenge, to promote high levels of integration and coordination, and to provide a critical mass of researchers for topics central to computational fire research. The project will build on established programs in the U.S. aimed at producing computer models for engineering analysis of building fires, e.g., the Fire Dynamics Simulator developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and FireFOAM developed by FM Global. The project will contribute data and software modules to a new open-access web-based repository, develop physics-based guidelines for computational best practices, and produce a new series of online tutorials for graduate-level students. The project will also advance fundamental knowledge and develop engineering-level tools for the generic problem of fire spread along solid flammable materials.<br/><br/>The project is proposed as part of a new initiative led by the International Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS) called ""the IAFSS Working Group on Measurement and Computation of Fire Phenomena"" (or the MaCFP Working Group). On the technical side, the project will focus on the problem of turbulent wall flames supplied with fuel vapors produced by the thermal degradation of solid flammable materials. The project will include performing both fine-grained (research-level) and coarse-grained (engineering-level) large eddy simulations. Coarse-grained simulations will require the development of new wall models for turbulent boundary layer flames. The simulation software adopted in the project is the free open-source fire model called FireFOAM. On the organizational side, the project will support the MaCFP Working Group effort, develop an open-access web-based digital archive of well-documented numerical simulations corresponding to selected target experiments, help identify key research topics and knowledge gaps in computational and experimental fire research, develop best practices in computational fire research, contribute to the organization of the new MaCFP workshop series, and help develop an international network of fire researchers and a community-wide forum for discussion and exchange of information."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Kelly Swarts is ""Direct estimation of maize population dynamics and targets of selection from near domestication to the present from archaeological samples in Mexico."" The host institution for this fellowship is the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, and the co-sponsoring scientists are Drs. Hernán Burbano and Johannes Krause.<br/><br/>This project focuses on domestication and adaptation of maize (corn) to better understand the basis for modern maize diversity. Maize is a globally important commodity crop plant, found everywhere from arid deserts to lowland tropics to northern Europe. Non-agricultural peoples in central Mexico first identified the biological potential in teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) nearly 10,000 years ago and began the selection process of transforming a wild grass into a dependent crop plant. This process continues to the present, as people carried maize first across the Americas and then the world. Each of these peoples has imposed their values and priorities onto maize, persistently selecting favorable and adapted varieties, and ultimately generating the remarkable biological and morphological diversity found globally in maize. The Fellow?s research addresses the arc of domestication and adaptation, integrating ancient genomics, maize genetics, and archaeology, to better understand the basis for modern maize diversity through maize evolution near the center of origin in Mexico. The Fellow is combining publicly available databases of modern maize with DNA derived from archaeological maize macroremains recovered from sites near the putative center of maize origin (dating from nearly 6,000 years ago to the present), to answer the following questions: 1) How strong was the domestication bottleneck and what were the effective population sizes of early maize?; 2) Can we refine the geographical region of domestication using archaeological populations?; 3) Which phenotypic traits and functional classes of the genome were targeted for selection and how did these change over time?; and 4) Can we differentiate the effects of the changing environment, culture, and heritable genetic variance in ancient maize phenotypes?<br/><br/>The Fellow is being trained to be proficient in the methods of extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, and to integrate these data with population and quantitative genetic analyses. Addressing maize evolution as a culturally-situated process is of societal importance because understanding the genetic impacts of past decisions can help us predict the genetic impacts of human actions going forward, for this globally important crop."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar at the intersection of Psychology and Engineering (Dynamical Systems). In an increasingly collaborative domain of science, this project represents a unique interdisciplinary direction that should be beneficial for both the fields. The main focus of this project is dating aggression, which poses significant societal problems including the continuity of aggression into committed long-term relationships, negative future implications for parenting, and an array of physical and mental health problems. Identifying mechanisms that explain dating aggression is crucial to interrupting maladaptive patterns of communication and bolstering healthy developmental trajectories for relationships. In contrast to prior research that focuses primarily on global individual characteristics associated with dating aggression, the present study is designed to capture dynamic unfolding of moment-to-moment relational processes that ultimately may lead to aggression. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a recent Ph.D. who aims to transform the scientific study of dating partner aggression through the interdisciplinary integration of novel technologies from psychology and electrical engineering. The focus of investigation is each partner's physiological state, which will be measured through behavioral, vocal, and physiological channels. Coordination across channels of physiological conditions -within individuals as well as between the dating partners-will be tested as putative factors in current experiences of couple aggression as well as past legacies from exposure to aggression in the dating partners' family-of-origin. Better understanding of factors associated with dating aggression-particularly modifiable factors such communication processes and accompanying physiological states can ultimately inform prevention and intervention efforts designed to reduce dating aggression. Decreasing the incidence of dating aggression as well as limiting the transmission of aggression across generations are priorities for multiple stakeholders:  individuals, families, researchers, clinicians, and policy-makers.     <br/><br/>The goal of the present project is to expand what is known about dating partner aggression and its link to family-of-origin aggression by identifying patterns of interaction and of physiological conditions that are indices of risk versus resilience for couple aggression. The theoretical innovation of this proposal lies in the conceptualization and testing of synchrony versus asynchrony across different physiological indices: vocal, physiological and psychological. Young dating couples will engage in multiple emotionally-charged discussions during which behaviors, vocal qualities, and physiology (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) are measured and recorded. Engineering-based methods of acoustic analysis and biomedical signal processing along with psychology-based human coding of behaviors and emotions will allow for the simultaneous capture of multiple regulatory processes. It is hypothesized that patterns of synchrony versus asynchrony across different channels will further knowledge of how ongoing regulatory processes contribute to relational aggression (e.g., physiological states that are not accompanied by concomitant behavioral ones may circumvent escalation). Risk and resilience for aggression, often studied as trait-like propensities, will be examined here from relational perspectives. By focusing on young adults who are in early stages of significant intimate relationships and through the application of novel technologies, this study will advance scientific inquiry on relationship aggression as well as on the continuity of aggression across generations."

One aspect of the research pursued in this project provides the mathematical foundation for the study of light and sound waves. Fourier analysis continues to play a significant role in deepening one's understanding of the equations that model this behavior. In particular, these investigations yield further insight as to how the presence of a hard boundary surface influences the development of waves. For example, if one listens to the symphony in an auditorium, the sounds heard are affected by the manner in which the acoustic waves reflect off the walls. In this sense, it can be important to understand how the shape of the hall influences its acoustics. While this is, of course, a classical problem, there is more to be understood in terms of how these interactions influence dispersive properties. Moreover, this line of work is important in the analysis of closely related nonlinear equations arising from fiber optics, relativity, and water waves, where there is much to be done in understanding and limiting the various types of instabilities that can occur.  A second aspect of this research project seeks to understand the link between geometry and the behavior of vibrational modes.  This is closely related to so-called Chladni plates, where one vibrates a metal plate with sand on it and studies the patterns formed by the accumulation of sand, corresponding to the lines on which the plate does not move.  Here it is interesting to consider how the shape of the plate influences the patterns that evolve and to estimate their length.  These investigations are closely related to themes in quantum chaos and semiclassical analysis.<br/><br/>This mathematical research project in harmonic analysis seeks to understand dispersive properties of light, sound, and quantum waves in various settings such as in curved backgrounds, in nonhomogeneous media, and in the presence of boundary conditions.  These dispersive properties are, in turn, influenced by the behavior of paths of least action, so the approaches here rely partially on methods in microlocal analysis, where one seeks to understand such wave propagation in phase space.  This wave behavior can be modeled by solutions to partial differential equations, possibly satisfying certain boundary conditions.  Of particular interest is to understand how dispersive properties affect basic regularity estimates for solutions to these equations.  These regularity estimates actually stem from Fourier restriction theory, and in particular from the classical theorems of Stein, Tomas, and Strichartz.  While the non-Euclidean character of these problems means that the classical Fourier transform is not directly applicable, harmonic analysis is nonetheless fundamental to the proposed research.  Indeed, the common methods employed by the principal investigator for understanding wave propagation such as Fourier integral operators, the Hadamard parametrix, and wave-packet methods, rely on Fourier analysis to a strong degree. Moreover, the oscillatory integrals that arise in applying these methods are very close to those encountered in harmonic analysis, hence the research here deepens our understanding of the classical theory."

This project targets to: i) provide a brand new and transformative drinking water monitoring system by leveraging the collective power of crowdsensing in a community; ii) address fundamental challenges in crowdsensing and enable humans to be both sensors and users of the system; iii) integrate education and research through citizen science to enhance knowledge of common people on water quality and public health; and iv) engage government officials and residents (end users) throughout the process to address a real-world problem in a local community, and generate outcomes that will be broadly applicable in other places to enable more sustainable and connected communities.<br/><br/>In this project, the PIs plan to develop a new Smart Water Sensing (SWS) system to reliably monitor the water contamination levels in a local community (Granger, IN) and a novel Crowdsensing Data Analysis Engine (CDAE) to address the data reliability and data sparsity challenges of using crowdsensing data. The research is a novel combination of two distinct disciplines: computer science and environmental engineering. The development of the proposed SWS system is exploratory given little prior work, but the success of this project would help to make crowdsensing a reliable alternative that transforms the household drinking water quality monitoring process."

A minimal surface mathematically models the shape of a soap film; the energy of such a film is proportional to its surface area, and so stable configurations are those with least area, that is, minimal surfaces. The theory of minimal surfaces directly connects to problems arising in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. More broadly, minimal surfaces are an important model for many geometric variational problems -- that is, problems where one seeks to find and study the properties of geometric objects that are optimal in some sense. In addition to being a fundamental principle in the physical sciences, variational problems arise in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics. In contrast to minimal surfaces, which are static, the mean curvature flow is a dynamic process. Roughly speaking, mean curvature flow continuously deforms a surface in a manner that decreases area as quickly as possible. It was first studied as a model of certain phenomena in materials science and has also found applications in computer graphics and image recognition. Furthermore, it is closely related to the Ricci flow that was employed in the solution of the Poincaré conjecture. As such, the mean curvature flow has promising potential applications to topology, several of which are explored by this project. <br/><br/>This project will use the mean curvature flow to investigate hypersurfaces in n-dimensional Euclidean space of low entropy, that is, hypersurfaces for which a natural measure of geometric complexity, the entropy, is small. It also studies properties of minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space using a variety of techniques. The first goal is to better understand properties, especially topological ones, of hypersurfaces of low entropy. This requires the investigation of the structure of non-compact self-similar (both shrinking and expanding) solutions to the mean curvature flow. The overarching objective is to see if hypersurfaces of low entropy in Euclidean four-space must smoothly bound a closed ball. This question is closely related to the smooth four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture, an important open problem in low-dimensional topology. The project also studies several problems connected to the theory of minimal surfaces. Chief among these is the question raised by Calabi, refined by Yau, and partially answered by Colding-Minicozzi, asking whether a complete, embedded minimal surface is properly embedded. In addition, the project explores the relationship between ideas in projective differential geometry and minimal surface theory. This includes studying an analog of the Korteweg-de Vries equation and investigating free-boundary minimal surfaces in the ball."

This research builds on an extensive long-term (since 1962) data set of individually marked yellow-bellied marmots at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado. The project will measure changes in key physiological and behavioral traits of individual marmots, and determine their influence on reproduction and survival in this model organism.  This work is important because it will provide new data and insights to better understand the limits of evolutionary responses to environmental change.  The work will continue a long term record of changes in fitness (i.e., reproductive success and survival) for populations of the marmot inhabiting different elevations, and linking this to traits like body mass, aggression, and dominance behavior in these mammals. Continuation of this data provides a valuable window on the effects of climate change on a hibernating mammal, and a priceless data set that can be used to explore both population and evolutionary dynamics.  Broader impacts of this project will include: recruitment and training of graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups; wide dissemination of research results to scientific audiences and the general public via scientific and popular articles and talks, and working with science journalists; and maintenance of a blog and website to provide public information on marmot biology and ecology. <br/><br/>This project will evaluate changes in the environment, in selection pressure, and in trait variance of marmot populations at both low and high elevation sites at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. The work will expand earlier analyses on body mass traits such as mass at emergence, rate of mass gain, and mass before hibernation. Analyses of changes in selection and in trait distributions will be based on the past 40 years and the next 2-3 years. The PI will focus analyses on behavioral and endocrine traits using 12-15 years of data, and use a combination of path analysis to test for causality and the multivariate animal model to decompose trait variance into its environmental and genetic components. By quantifying how selection on traits changes over time, how changes in reproductive success and survival affects traits, and how changes in these traits affect reproduction and survival, this research will integrate proximate and ultimate mechanisms and use novel approaches to study causal inference."

Some standard examples include the Web graph, social networks, and biological networks. The prevalence of such large data sets has led to a rapidly growing interest in the design of sublinear algorithms, that is, algorithms whose computational resource requirements are substantially smaller than the input size. As vast amounts of networked data is being collected and processed in diverse application domains, sublinear algorithms that accurately compute and describe relevant properties of the data will increasingly play an important role in computing on such data. The goal of this project is to develop sublinear algorithms for several fundamental graph optimization problems. The specific graph problems studied in this project are of both theoretical and practical interest, and are among the most well-studied problems in combinatorial optimization. Additionally, a study of these problems through the lens of sublinear algorithms is likely to yield new insights into computational aspects of these fundamental problems. The research proposed here will go hand-in-hand with educational and student-training initiatives, including mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students, and teaching in programs that introduce high-school students to exciting ideas in theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>The research focus of this project is broadly divided into three parts. In the first part, the PIs consider streaming algorithms for graph problems where an input graph is revealed as a sequence of edge insertions and deletions. Some representative problems studied in this part include matching and cut problems in graphs. While both cuts and matchings have received considerable attention in the streaming literature, several important questions concerning their computability in the streaming model remain unresolved. In the second part, they consider communication-efficient protocols in a distributed setting when the input graph is partitioned across multiple sites. This model offers a natural abstraction for distributed computation and is closely related to the streaming model. A representative problem here is to understand the communication complexity of the maximum matching problem. The third part of this project investigates a new model for sketching graphs that consist of a (large) static part and a (small) dynamic part. The goal here is to understand if there exist compact sketches for several fundamental graph problems whose size is proportional to the size of the dynamic part of the input graph such that any updates to the dynamic part can be applied directly to the sketch."

In certain cases, these novel crystal modifications with enhanced physical and mechanical properties can be retained after removal of pressure resulting in potential industrial applications. The conversion of graphitic carbon into diamond by application of high-pressure and high-temperature is a prime example of this research. This research program will carry out high-pressure high-temperature studies on transition metals and alloys that are widely used in aerospace, biomedical, and nuclear industry. This research is enabled by advances in the generation of ultra high pressure up to ten million atmospheres in the laboratory using an innovative design of diamond anvils in high pressure devices. This advance in high pressure technique coupled with very bright sources of x-rays allows us to probe changes in crystal structures so we can construct stability maps for various crystal structures at elevated pressures and temperatures. These stability maps will allow researchers to design new strategies to synthesize these materials in bulk form for industrial applications. The project participants will receive extensive research training at the premier national facilities employing x-ray synchrotron radiation in materials research leading to a pipeline of trained scientific workforce in high pressure science. Our long-term partnership with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the southeastern region will ensure participation of underrepresented minority groups in this research program.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The study of transition metals under extreme conditions has seen rapid progress in the last few years with the attainment of near Terapascal (1 TPa = 1000 GPa) static pressures using two-stage diamond micro-anvils along with the development of millisecond x-ray diffraction techniques using fast detectors at the synchrotron facilities. At the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a novel method for the fabrication of two-stage diamond micro-anvils using a chemical vapor deposition technique has been developed. In addition, rapid pressure and temperature changes can be applied to samples using piezoelectric drivers (dynamic diamond anvil cells) and boron-doped heating anvils, thus providing ideal tools to study phase transformations and transformation kinetics in transition metals and alloys under extreme conditions. In this study, a focus is on transformation kinetics of hexagonal close-packed (hcp-phase) to simple hexagonal (omega-phase) transformation and from omega-phase to body-centered cubic (bcc-phase) in Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) and Hafnium-Tantalum (Hf-Ta) alloys. The goal is to establish the occurrence of other novel phases like the orthorhombic modifications (gamma, delta, and eta phases) in early transition metals and alloys under hydrostatic (neon pressure medium) and non-hydrostatic (no pressure medium) conditions. In Osmium (Os) metal, structural anomalies have been observed at 150 GPa and 440 GPa at ambient temperature that warrant further investigations at elevated temperatures. It is anticipated that most of the early members of the transition metal series are converted in to nearly pure d-band metals as s-electron levels move above the Fermi-level at extreme pressures. This study would provide crystal structure data and pressure-volume data for this unique electronic state of transition metals and alloys under extreme conditions for direct comparison with the theoretical models."

Violent, explosive events throughout the Universe often produce relatively brief signals that astronomers detect.  A huge, abrupt increase in brightness accompanies a supernova explosion that completely destroys the star.  The brief ?chirp? of gravitational radiation detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in September 2015 came from the merger of two massive black holes.  And in 2007, a ?chirp? of radio emission lasting a few thousandths of a second signaled the discovery of a previously unknown class of astronomical object.  Astronomers think that this and other so-called ?Fast Radio Bursts? (FRBs) originate in distant galaxies far out in the Universe.  To find out what are the sources of the FRBs, astronomers need to discover many more examples, determine their properties, and if possible identify them with events observed in other ways.  This project will deploy radio detectors at the 1000-foot-diameter radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.  The detectors will conduct automated searches for FRBs and communicate the discoveries within minutes to enable follow-up observations.  The scientists will also share their results to the general public through a public website, a 3D video, and planetarium programs.  Even their undergraduate students will help.  They will convey the excitement of research in radio astronomy to more than 3,600 K-12 students each year.<br/><br/>2.	A bright millisecond radio burst discovered in 2007 indicated the existence of a previously unknown population of radio sources.  Recent discoveries of more of these Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has confirmed the existence of this population, which has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries in radio astronomy in recent decades.  With typical durations of a few milliseconds, FRBs are strongly dispersed in frequency, suggesting an extragalactic origin.  The primary goal of this project is to deploy autonomous dedicated detectors at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico and at the Green Bank Telescope to search for more of these transient events across large swaths of the sky, to make the detections rapidly available (within minutes) for follow-up observations at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and in gravitational-wave data, and to record and characterize the properties of these detections.  The Principal Investigators anticipate finding dozens of FRBs each year as well as possibly discovering bursting Galactic neutron stars and possibly completely new classes of transient radio sources.  The Principal Investigators also have an extensive and well-developed plan to employ their research for broader societal impacts.  These include a public website for rapid dissemination of their results to non-scientists, presentations about radio astronomy by undergraduates to more than 3,600 K-12 students per year, and the development of a 3D video about the research that has strong potential to grab the public interest and teach the public about science through astronomy."

To accurately interpret and connect these nearby and very distant galaxy observations, precise computer simulations that consider the entire star formation history are essential.  The purpose of this project is to make detailed computer simulations of the formation process of nearby dwarf and distant ultra-diffuse galaxies.  These simulations will track the complete star formation history of dwarf galaxies including their earliest stellar and galactic ancestors.  This project meets the national need to develop US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training students in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and software engineering, which will enable these students to excel in a competitive job market.

This project will  support the development of a hybrid radiation transport solver that incorporates the advantages of both ray tracing methods and moment methods.  This method will be utilized in a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies, following their complete star formation, starting with individual massive metal-free stars.  The simulation data produced during the course of this project, as well as various data products, will be made publicly available through the nascent National Data Service.

Scott Hartley in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at Miami University. In nature, the structural complexity of large molecules (e.g., proteins), and ultimately their function, is generated by the folding of smaller molecular pieces (oligomers and polymers). This fact has inspired many efforts to study non-biological ""foldamers"" smaller molecular pieces that fold in well-defined ways. Research in the Hartley group focuses on the ortho-phenylenes, a simple class of foldamers formed from directly connected aromatic rings. In this project, the Harley group develops methods to control the folding of o-phenylenes and incorporates the rings into more complex structures. The project involves graduate students, undergraduates, and high-school teachers working to understand fundamental concepts of molecular folding, self-assembly, and molecular recognition, using the techniques of organic synthesis, computational chemistry, and various characterization methods.<br/><br/>The ortho-phenylenes combine several features that make them attractive as ""next-generation"" foldamers.  They are straightforward to synthesize.  Their folding behavior is easily modeled using simple, inexpensive methods.  Their exact, solution-phase folding state can be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. This project has three specific aims that take advantage of these features. First, the twist-sense of o-phenylene folding is controlled using chiral end groups. While this sort of control over oligomer folding has been demonstrated in other systems, it is critical for more advanced uses of o-phenylenes.  If successful, may be used to test o-phenylenes for spin-selective electron transport. Second, o-phenylene subunits are linked together into macrocycles. This simple system represents a first step toward incorporating o-phenylene secondary structures (i.e., helices) into higher-order structures, and provides a framework to test the conformational interaction between bridged foldamer subunits.

The most common example of such noisy input is Brownian motion, which occurs in models throughout science, engineering, and economics. Within this context, the so-called rough paths theory is a powerful method that allows one to define noisy systems in a wide variety of situations (well beyond the Brownian motion case). The rough paths theory also gives an almost-deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach, which is highly probabilistic in essence. The term stochastic analysis usually encompasses both stochastic integration of Itô type and Malliavin calculus techniques. The latter can be viewed as a way to define an analysis at the path level; it leads to deep and useful results concerning stochastic differential equations. This research project aims to combine rough-paths and Malliavin calculus techniques in order to give a meaning to and then study noisy partial differential equations that model heat transfer in random environments. The project will also study the large time behavior of differential equations driven by a general class of noises, and see how to statistically identify this kind of system by observing a typical path. <br/><br/>This research project focuses on interactions between rough paths theory, stochastic partial differential equations (PDE), and Malliavin calculus. A more specific list of the six subprojects can be structured as follows: (1) stochastic PDEs, with (a) parabolic Anderson model in rough environment, (b) parabolic Anderson model in dimension 2, and (c) density for solutions to rough PDEs; and (2) rough finite-dimensional systems, with (a) ergodic properties for rough differential equations, (b) estimation procedures for rough stochastic differential equations, and (c) renormalization of numerical schemes for rough stochastic differential equations.  In all those projects, the principal investigator will use stochastic analysis methods combined with analysis and rough paths tools in order to study some new yet very natural classes of processes. Because even the definition of those objects was far from clear before the rough path theory was introduced, their study is both motivating and challenging."

Relevant physical effects include instruction execution time, memory access time, power consumption and electromagnetic radiation. Fifteen years after differential power analysis was first demonstrated, side-channel attacks are affecting software implementations in a broad variety of processors. Yet, without the support of automatic tools, programmers still have to resort to manual and error-prone insertion of countermeasures. This is problematic because side-channel leakage is an implementation effect that is difficult to infer or predict from source code. This project will create automatic software tools that can help software developers synthesize and verify side-channel resistant software, quickly and correctly. The automatic software code transformation techniques to be developed in this project will be released as an open-source compiler, thereby bringing the results in reach of a larger community.<br/><br/>This project will develop design automation techniques to systematically remove the dependency of side channel leakage to secret data. The proposed countermeasures will be based on inductive synthesis and formal verification, and they will be integrated as compiler-driven transformations on the software code. The estimation of side-channel leakage will be guided through a parameterized processor architecture model. This will ensure that the side-channel resistant code is portable across different architecture targets. Compared to existing countermeasure designs, the proposed approach is generic and application independent; it can be used by non-specialist programmers; and it offers correct-by-construction guarantees through formal analysis techniques.<br/><br/>The cross-cutting nature of security brings a need for side-channel resistant design to a wide variety of application domains including automotive, industrial, health-care, or smart-grid. Developers from these fields need tools to help them to quickly build correct and secure software without having to deal with the pitfalls of side-channel resistant design. Automatic insertion of side-channel countermeasures will address this need and lead to cheaper and more secure products. The research outcomes of this project include an open-source, extensible compiler, and a hardware demonstration platform to validate the side-channel resistant code generated using the compiler. These artifacts enable the formal methods and compiler community to investigate new countermeasure techniques, and they help the cryptographic engineering community to create a benchmark suite to validate these countermeasures. The PIs will advertise this potential in their respective communities by developing a summer school to teach the outcomes of their research. The PIs will also develop a graduate course that teams up students in embedded system design with students in compiler design."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Tricia L. Rubi is, ""Do epigenetic mechanisms facilitate colonization? Characterizing methylation profiles in historic colonist populations using museum specimens."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Michigan, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Ben Dantzer.  <br/><br/>The major aim of the Fellow's research is to conduct novel methylation analyses using museum specimens to investigate the role of epigenetic effects in adaptive processes. The role of epigenetic mechanisms (processes that modulate gene expression) in adaptation is unresolved and contentious. Museum collections are a remarkable tool for investigating questions related to adaptation because they allow us to examine change over time. Recently, it was discovered that ancient and historic specimens retain patterns of in vivo DNA methylation, one of the best-explored epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically, the Fellow's research tests the hypothesis that epigenetic diversity acts as an adaptive buffer in populations colonizing novel environments. Colonist populations must rapidly adapt to novel conditions, often while faced with relatively low genetic diversity. In such populations, epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation may facilitate rapid adaptation by generating phenotypic variation, including environmentally-induced phenotypes. Focusing on the well-documented northward expansion of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), this research characterizes spatial and temporal patterns in genetic and epigenetic diversity over the course of a range expansion in order to test the hypothesis that epigenetic effects facilitate colonization by acting as an adaptive buffer at the expansion front.<br/><br/>The Fellow is building skills in molecular genetic and epigenetic lab techniques and data analysis, and applying these skills to the emerging field of museum epigenomics. This work helps to build and modernize existing museum resources, and all genetic and epigenetic data are being made publicly available. In addition, the Fellow is conducting outreach activities aimed at educating the public about museum collections and how they contribute to research. As part of these activities, the fellow is partnering with Detroit-area groups that promote STEM field participation by underrepresented groups such as low income and minority youth (MYELIN) and young women (FEMMES)."

Social scientists have documented the enivronmental controversies and local resistance that sometimes accompany these practices, as well as the movements calling for more sustainable and environemtnally benign forms of energy. But less attention has been paid to communities that favor petroleum development.  That is the subject of the research supported by this award, which will be undertaken by University of Colorado doctoral student, Gregorio Ortiz, under the supervision of anthropologist, Dr. Jerry K. Jacka. The researchers ask: How do communities that support fracking engage with the environmental discourse against it? How do people in such communities understand their place within environmental discourse and are these conceptions affected by their support of extractive development?  Is local extractive development, in turn, affected by the sensibilites of local communities? Findings from this research will fill critical gaps in scientific understanding of the social and environmental impacts of resource extraction.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted around the on-going development of the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. The region is an appropriate site because it has a long history of petroleum development and natural environmental challenges, such as drought. The oil boom of the 1970s and 1980s shaped the area's recent history even though it did not always lead to infrastructural development nor improved livelihoods. Consequently, the subsequent resource ""bust"" has affected local livelihoods in complex ways, which makes the study of why local residents support further petroleum development particularly interesting. Ortiz will focus on the communities of the Middle Rio Grande Development Council of Governments in south Texas. He will use a mix of social science methods beginning with archival research; semi-structured interviews with both governmental and non-governmental local and state representatives whose work engages the petroleum industry; and participant observations and interviews with petroleum industry workers. He will then move on to in-depth ethnography, participant observation, and surveys in two local communities. Data collection activities will include interviews, focus groups, and local land and resource mapping. The researcher will highlight how environmental concerns do and do not inform development policy and projects, and if and how perspectives on the environment have changed since the development of the Eagle Ford Shale began.  Findings from this study will contribute to the development of more complete social science theory about the relationship between development, energy, and environmental judgment. Findings may also inform development of community-appropriate energy policy."

Wachs<br/>Proposal Number:  1605805<br/><br/>Many important chemicals in use today are derived from non-renewable petroleum resources.  An important example is butadiene, which is converted to synthetic rubber used in manufacture of tires.  One approach to make tire manufacture more sustainable is to find a non-petroleum substitute for butadiene.  Ethanol produced from renewable cellulosic biofuel and bio-refinery operations is potentially an alternative feedstock for synthetic rubber production, if a suitable catalyst to drive the conversion of ethanol to butadiene can be found.   This project will seek fundamental understanding of the interaction of ethanol with metal oxide catalyst surfaces at the molecular level to discover the best type of catalyst and the optimal conditions needed to convert ethanol to butadiene.  The proposed research has the potential to lead to a viable pathway to produce synthetic rubber from sustainable feedstocks with a lower carbon footprint.  The educational activities associated with the project include international opportunities for student research at a renowned catalyst research institute in Germany, as well as the development of modules for outreach on sustainable chemicals and fuels.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research is to elucidate the molecular level structure-reactivity/selectivity relationships for the catalytic conversion of bioethanol to butadiene.  This goal will be accomplished through an integrated study of catalyst synthesis, spectroscopic analysis of surface chemistry, molecular calculations, and transient reaction kinetics analysis.  A well-defined series of catalysts will be synthesized to explore the effects of the silica-supported active metal oxide phase domain size, local structure, oxidation state, acid-base-redox characteristics and interactions between the active metal oxides. The catalysts will be characterized at the molecular level with in situ and operando spectroscopy under reaction conditions. The ethanol surface chemistry will be probed with Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) spectroscopy, and isotopic labeling will assist in revealing the reaction pathways of specific molecular functionalities involving in the coupling reaction to yield butadiene.  Steady State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA) reaction studies will provide additional kinetic details about the reaction network and rate-determining-steps. The experimental findings will be complemented with theoretical calculations to get a deeper, molecular- level understanding of the active sites required for each catalytic step.  All of this information will be combined to establish structure-activity/selectivity relationships to guide the molecular design of improved catalysts for the conversion of bioethanol to butadiene."

Galaxies like our own Milky Way are vast collections of hundreds of billions of stars orbiting in a disk perhaps 100,000 light-years in diameter.  Lurking in the centers of many and perhaps all galaxies are supermassive black holes?mysterious objects containing millions or billions of times as much mass as our own Sun, but crammed into a volume that would fit easily within the inner solar system.  In the past few years, astronomers have discovered luminous flares emanating from the core regions of nearby galaxies.  These are thought to originate from the disruption of individual stars that were orbiting so close to the black hole that they were ripped apart by its strong gravitational force.  The energy emitted as the remains of the star fall into the black hole produces the luminous flare.  The collaborators on this project will carry out detailed numerical modeling of these events and will make publicly available their computer codes.  The collaborators also plan to make their work accessible to a wide audience by teaming experts with students in the visual arts and digital media to produce visual simulations of great power and beauty.  In addition, they will participate in a strong program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>2.	Over the past several years, wide-field transient surveys have begun to deliver more and better data about tidal disruption events (TDEs).  A TDE is produced when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the core of a galaxy.  Because the theoretical understanding of such events remains incomplete, the collaborators will bring together experts in numerical hydrodynamics and non-equilibrium radiative transfer to study how matter from the tidally disrupted star loses kinetic energy and accretes onto the SMBH, identify the radiative processes that generate the X-ray/ultraviolet/optical spectra and light curves of TDEs, develop a numerical toolset to be used in analyzing TDEs, and apply it to constrain the properties of the star and the SMBH in observed events.  For TDEs with well-resolved light curves, their models will enable a better characterization of the SMBHs and the dense stellar clusters that surround them.  Building upon existing strengths of the partner institutions, the collaborators will also cross-fertilize the training of computational scientists and students in the visual arts and digital media using state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations as common ground.  The resulting visual products will be used to disseminate the results, help to inform the general public about science and the universe, and provide raw material for science curricula, documentaries, and astronomy presentations.  The investigators will also continue their program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups."

Gellman's group develops new types of protein-like molecules, based on biologically-inspired designs. Biological systems contain sequence-specific oligomers and polymers that fold to particular shapes. Gellman's laboratory creates unnatural oligomers, or ""foldamers"", that also adopt discrete shapes.  This research employs beta- and gamma-amino acids as alternative building blocks to the natural alpha-amino acids. The protein folding process arranges key subunits into the precise three-dimensional arrays that are necessary for binding to other molecules and catalyzing chemical reactions.  A central aim of the Gellman group's research is to develop synthetic foldamers that display protein-like binding and/or catalytic properties.  These materials ultimately might surpass proteins in terms of specific functions.  This basic research may lead to new types of drug molecules or new types of nanoscale manufacturing capabilities.  Conducting this research provides outstanding interdisciplinary training to undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/>The study of foldamers is an area of chemistry research that offers opportunities for invention in terms of basic research and practical development.  This research focuses on cutting-edge challenges in terms of molecular design.  One aim is to link understanding of small-molecule conformational propensities to the higher-order structure preferences that emerge in oligomers built from the smaller molecules.  In particular, The Gellman group creates secondary structures containing beta- and/or gamma-amino acid residues that form new helical secondary structures with large internal cavities, a feature not found among protein secondary structures.  A second aim is to leverage previously acquired knowledge of beta-peptide and alpha/beta-peptide folding behavior to arrange pairs of reactive groups in ways that catalyze synthetically useful reactions.  A third aim focuses on quantitative assessment of structure-stability relationships for foldamer helices, information that has been largely unavailable to date. The research group seeks to understand how changes in subunit structure affects the stability of foldamer secondary structures.  Progress toward each of these goals may improve understanding of relationships between molecular structure and function."

Use of these materials for deploying antenna structures in space, wind and ocean energy harvesting systems, nanopositioning systems and numerous other applications make them an economically important class of metallic materials.  Alloys based on Iron and Gallium metals  have been demonstrated to be an attractive alternative and further development of this class of  alloys requires a large data base of how alloying elements, structure and defects influence composition-structure-property correlations. This project addresses these important issues. The project will further the knowledge that will enable the design and development of a new generation of inexpensive and high performance alloys for use in sensor and actuator applications. The project will further the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students and enhance research opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students.  The project will also have a great impact in a wide range of applications that will utilize these rare-earth free, strong, ductile, low cost and high performance sensor and actuator materials. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/> <br/>The project examines how short-range ordering, long-range ordering and structural dislocations can dramatically influence the magnetostriction in FeGa, and other alpha-Fe based magnetostrictive alloy single crystals. We have shown in earlier work that the addition of Ga to Fe results in a large increase in magnetostriction at low applied magnetic fields and that these alloys are strong and ductile. Ongoing investigations also suggest that internal inhomogeneous strains introduced by the structural changes and defects play a much greater role than has been appreciated in determining the magnetostriction in these alloys. The long-term objectives are to gain an improved understanding of magnetostriction in Fe and Fe alloys and formulate the guidelines for the design of alloys with attractive magnetostrictive and mechanical properties. As a part of this effort, the proposed work will focus on a detailed examination of (a) how short range order is changed with thermal treatments and how it influences magnetostriction in Fe-Ga, Fe-Al and Fe-Si alloys, (b) influence of coherent second phases on the  internal strain modulations and how it affects magnetostriction (c) the effect of well-defined crystal defects in particular dislocation structures introduced with controlled single crystal deformation on magnetostriction and (d) Interference contrast imaging of microcellular patterns and how they are influenced by the ordered second phases regions and dislocation arrays. The work envisaged involves alloy preparation by vacuum arc-melting, single crystal growth using Bridgman technique, structural evaluation, magnetic and magnetostriction measurements, and structure-composition-property correlations. Characterization and analysis of the defects will be carried out using transmission electron microscopy. Elastic measurements will be made using the resonance ultrasound spectroscopy technique. Theta-2 theta x-ray diffraction scans, rocking curve scans and x-ray topography measurements will be performed to assess the crystal orientation, short range order and the structural defects."

The second law of thermodynamics tell us that, in closed systems, entropy always increases; it is maximized at thermodynamic equilibrium.  Given a collection of data, the ""principle of maximum entropy"" asserts that, among all hypothetical probability distributions that agree with the data, the one of maximum entropy best represents the current state of knowledge.<br/><br/>Moreover, if one considers a convex set of probability distributions, the problem of maximizing a strongly concave function (like the Shannon entropy) over this set is computationally tractable and has a unique optimal solution.  This project is concerned with the structure and computational utility of entropy maximizers in algorithm design, machine learning, complexity theory, and related areas of discrete mathematics.  In particular, the project will study the role of entropy maximization in encouraging simplicity in the optimum solution.  This property stands to reason:  The entropy maximizer should intuitively contain only the information implied by the constraints and nothing more.<br/><br/>The scope of the project includes not only classical entropy functionals like the Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, but also the analogous notions for quantum states (von Neumann entropy).  The study of quantum entropy maximizers has far-reaching applications in semi-definite programming and communication complexity.  Moreover, much of the theory extends to other Bregman divergences, and this is particularly relevant for applications in online algorithms where certain smoothed entropy functionals become relevant.  A portion of the project concerns entropy optimality on path spaces.  This perspective provides a novel view of Markov processes on discrete and continuous spaces.  The PI will employ this viewpoint to study rapid mixing of Markov chains, as well smoothing properties of the noise operator on the discrete hypercube (a topic with remarkable applications in complexity theory and hardness of approximation).<br/><br/>Finally, it should be mentioned that iterative algorithms for finding entropy maximizers can be viewed in the framework of entropy-regularized gradient descent; such algorithms are fundamental in machine learning (boosting) and online convex optimization (multiplicative weights update).  This provides a powerful connection to large bodies of work, and a substantial motivation for the project is to create a bridge of ideas and techniques between the two perspectives.<br/><br/>Broader impact of the project includes training of the next generation of scientists, including at the undergraduate level.  This project presents a number of opportunities for undergraduate researchers to contribute in a meaningful and substantial way, while at the same time receiving valuable mentoring and experience as developing scientists."

Diffusion along metal/ceramic interfaces plays a key role in a number of technological processes in a variety of industrial sectors, including microelectronics (e.g., interconnect interfaces), tooling (e.g., Co-WC interfaces), and automotive (Pt,Pd-alumina catalyst interfaces) sectors.  This type of interface diffusion largely determines the rates of electromigration in metal interconnects and stress relaxation in thin films, and the dispersion stability of metal catalysts. The design of better components and more stable catalysts is impeded because of both the lack of reliable data and the understanding of the basic science. Providing both the fundamental, mechanistic science and reliable diffusion data are the main goals of this project.<br/><br/>Part II: Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The main objective of the proposed Project is to understand the microscopic, atomistic mechanisms of metal diffusion along the metal-ceramic interfaces employing precise experimental measurements and first-principle computational techniques. These studies will be performed in parallel on the same set of interfaces. This synergistic study will establish the mechanisms for metal diffusion along metal/ceramic interfaces, these diffusivities establish the hierarchy of fast diffusion paths in crystalline solids. This is a focused program of parallel and correlated computational and experimental studies of the self- and hetero-diffusion of metal atoms along several different metal-ceramic interfaces. The reliability of the computational methods will be verified by comparing simulated atomic structures and energies with the experimentally determined ones for the same set of interfaces. This work identifies which mechanisms dominate transport kinetics in a wide range of multiphase system applications. The experiments will be performed by dewetting a metal film on a ceramic substrate to form metal particles that are then coated with the diffusants.  The interface diffusion will be monitored using analytical HRTEM.  The simulations will address point defect and interface energetics and transport using first principles techniques coupled  with molecular dynamics simulations."

Visual data is important because visual datasets are rapidly growing in size, due to the use of cell-phone cameras, photo and video sharing online, and in scientific and medical imaging. The intellectual merits are that specialized program optimizations are being developed specifically for visual computing and for languages that enable rapid prototyping, alongside techniques that allow the computer to automatically search through different candidate optimizations and choose the fastest one. The project's broader significance and importance are that it will make the writing of computer programs that operate over visual datasets more accessible to novice programmers, make visual computing more accessible to a broader audience, permit faster research and development over visual programs, and make such programs themselves be more efficient.<br/><br/>More specifically, this research program is producing translating compilers that are specialized to handle programs that compute over visual data. The group led by the PI is researching new compilers that translate code from dynamic languages into highly efficient code in a target language. Dynamic languages are defined as those with a very dynamic run-time model, for example, MATLAB, Python, and Javascript. The target language is a language such as C that permits implementation of highly efficient programs. This research framework incorporates ideas from compilers, graphics, computer vision, visual perception, and formal and natural languages. The research will make a number of key intellectual contributions. First, new domain-specific translations and optimizations for visual computing will be formalized into manual rules that can be applied to any input program. Second, the team will research a novel approach of automatically learning translations, instead of using manually-coded rules. This can take the form of learning translation ""suggestions"" from humans, who can interactively suggest better output code. Third, a new search process based on offline auto-tuning will be used to select the translations that result in the fastest program. The success of the project will be verified against a comprehensive test suite of programs from computer vision and graphics."

Alga microorganisms are cultivated in fermenters, often in dilute concentration in an aqueous phase. Dewatering of the biomass or algae and recycle and reuse of the cleaned-up water are key fundamental research issues that impact commercial competitiveness. The PIs will research and design efficient, scalable, and multifunctional reactive electrochemical membranes (REMs) to harvest value-added products derived from the biomass (e.g., biofuels and specialty chemicals) in a sustainable manner. Biomass separation using membrane filtration is currently characterized by high operational cost due to severe membrane fouling and the need for frequent backwashing to remove the foulants. The proposed research will use the hybrid membranes to mitigate membrane fouling and to remove the toxic inhibitors that will promote water reuse. The research outcomes will advance the fundamental science and engineering of biomass separations, and potentially lead to critical, transformative technologies for biomass and food processing, drinking water treatment, and biomolecule purification in the pharmaceutical industries.  <br/><br/>This principal investigators will use algae as a model biomass organism; and will focus on characterizing membrane fouling, water reuse for algae regrowth, and electrochemical pre-treatment of algal cells. Research tasks will include (1) synthesis and characterization of a suite of tailored monolithic or nanofibrous REMs for algal recovery; (2) evaluation of algae separation efficiency, permeate water treatment, and anti-fouling properties of REMs; (3) elucidation of algae cell disruption efficiency and the underlying mechanisms of electrochemical oxidation using microfluidic experiments; and (4) experimental and theoretical assessment of membrane fouling and regeneration strategies. The fundamental knowledge generated by this project will lead to transformative solutions that address the grand challenges at the energy-water nexus. First, the research will provide fundamental guidelines to the design of REMs with excellent filtration performance, flexible design, and durability of operation. Secondly, the research will promote water and nutrient reuse in waste streams or cultivation media, which reduces the water and energy footprints of renewable energy production. Finally, the project will train and mentor at least three Ph.D. students and a large number of undergraduate and senior high school students that will be recruited from underrepresented groups in STEM at the three collaborating institutions for research experiences."

This requires control over not only structure, size and shape but also chemical composition. In this project, methods are being developed for patterning metals into nanoscale objects by using chemical reagents and electrons. Students involved in this project present their work at scientific meetings and publish papers in peer reviewed journals.  They also have the opportunity to conduct experiments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, broadening their educational experience while enhancing opportunities for future career placement. To communicate the excitement of science to the general public, participants in the project are generating a series of 90-second ""Tiny Tech"" radio modules and podcasts that feature real world applications of chemistry and chemistry-based nanoscience. <br/><br/>Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a promising nanofabrication technique that can create metal-containing nanostructures for photonics, catalysis, sensing and plasmonics.  In this technique, electrons are used to induce local decomposition of organometallic precursors adsorbed onto solid substrates in a vacuum environment. FEBID combines the advantages of direct-write lithographic processes (e.g., high spatial resolution, site-specificity, mask-less, resist-less) with the flexibility to deposit materials on non-planar surfaces, allowing creation of spatially and geometrically well-defined three-dimensional, metal-containing nanostructures. For FEBID to emerge as a broadly applicable nanofabrication technique, however, control must be exerted over not just the size and shape, but also the chemical composition of the nanostructures. The current practice is to use precursors designed for thermal processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). These CVD precursors generally create FEBID deposits with high levels of organic contamination, limiting potential applications. This project is addressing the issue of contamination in FEBID materials.  This research synthesizes and evaluates new organometallic precursors designed specifically for FEBID.  The efforts are guided by mechanistic insights from surface science.  They are also improved by developing new purification strategies for FEBID nanostructures. The results are improving the understanding of FEBID by generating detailed mechanistic information on the electron-molecule reactions. Careful design of the reaction chemistry allows control of the purity while the ability to focus electron beams allows control of the size and shape of the metal structure in a process analogous to 3D printing of plastic objects."

Existing optical systems are limited by 1) requirements of relatively intense excitation light that causes photobleaching and phototoxicity that limits the duration of the experiment and hinders stimulating the neuronal circuit under investigation or 2) by the incompatability of optical systems that can operate at lower intensities with standard microfluidic stimulation methods.  The central aim of this proposal is to develop microfluidic devices using optical index-matched materials compatible with a low intensity microscopy method, ""selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM)."" Preliminary results show feasibility of hydrogel-based systems to record neural responses in C elegans for hours, as well as compatibility with simultaneous optogenetic (pulsed visible light) neural activation and readout.  The proposed system will for the first time enable simultaneous chemical and optical stimulation and perturbation of brain circuits under investigation, with multiple neurons monitored for activity over several hours.  The methods developed will impact the broader neuroscience community, in which neural imaging is a critical method for developmental, structural, and functional brain studies.  Materials and hardware, including microfluidic systems, will be made accessible to the research and commercial community.  Broader impact is also achieved through a comprehensive educational plan including innovative curricula in advanced biomedical imaging focused on neuroscience applications and outreach activities to increase involvement of STEM-underrepresented students and local communities, through exciting, hands-on modules for summer programs and scientific demonstrations.   <br/> <br/>Sensation, memory, and behaviors are encoded in dynamic electrochemical patterns within neurons of the brain. Recent advances in fast three-3D microscopy have enabled the optical imaging of activity in large numbers of neurons at once, in some cases nearly the entire brain of an organism. Such systems promise to revolutionize the study of neural circuit regulation, compared with sparse single-neuron recordings that do not capture neural dynamics elsewhere in the circuit. However, current confocal and structured illumination systems are limited by their requirements of relatively intense excitation light, causing photobleaching and phototoxicity that limits the duration of an experiment, and by difficulty in stimulating the neuronal circuit under investigation. While light sheet or selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) captures more emission light and therefore operates at lower excitation intensity, optical requirements are incompatible with standard microfluidic stimulation methods. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for SPIM-compatible microfluidic stimulation methods to enable long-term, high resolution recording of stimulated brain activity in living animals. The central aim of this proposal is to develop microfluidic devices using optical index-matched materials compatible with SPIM. Preliminary results show feasibility of hydrogel-based systems to record neural responses in C elegans for hours, as well as compatibility with simultaneous optogenetic neural activation and readout. Specific objectives are: 1) development of diSPIM-compatible sample immobilization and microfluidic stimulation, 2) multi-neuronal imaging of sensory-stimulated brain circuits to observe and study sensory feedback, and 3) multi-neuronal imaging of optogenetically-stimulated brain circuits to observe the effect of reversible circuit perturbations on ensemble neural activity in the same animal.  Innovations of the propose include: 1) identification of hydrogel encapsulants compatible with diSPIM that immobilize living animals but maintain organism health and function; 2) microfluidic designs, including hydrogel-glass or hydrogel-silicone hybrids, that deliver precise chemical concentrations; 3) identification of sensory neurons detecting novel chemical stimuli; 4) identification of sensory feedback and study of its regulation via candidate genetic mutants; 5) simultaneous optogenetic and chemical stimulation while monitoring multiple sensory and interneurons, to observe neural responses during dynamic circuit perturbation.  The end result will be a new configuration of the dual-view inverted (diSPIM) system and protocols suitable for the embedding of cells and small organisms to record high-resolution, isotropic, fluorescent 3-D volumetric images for long time periods during and after chemical and/or optogenetic stimulation. The studies planned will improve the understanding of circuit computation in C. elegans when stimulated with natural sensory stimuli (e.g., chemicals) and by arbitrary optogenetic stimulation within a compact and well-defined neural circuit. The methods developed will impact the broader neuroscience community, in which neural imaging is a critical method for developmental, structural, and functional brain studies.  Materials and hardware, including microfluidic systems, will be made accessible to the research and commercial community.  Integrated with the proposed research is a comprehensive educational program toward training and educating the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists, particularly biologist-engineers, including: 1) innovative curricula in advanced biomedical imaging with focus on neuroscience applications, 2) mentoring undergraduate and graduate students through research and engineering design projects, and 3) outreach to increase involvement of STEM-underrepresented students and local communities, through exciting, hands-on modules for summer programs and scientific demonstrations."

Phage biology is a driver in global ecology and in the global dynamics of gene transfer. Phages, as the natural predators of bacteria, have recognized potential as antibacterial agents, both in human health and in animal husbandry and agriculture. Phages, because they can be restricted to specific bacterial species or genera, represent the only currently available tool for manipulating the diverse populations of bacteria in microbiomes, now known to be an essential component of health and development. Despite all of these factors, only a tiny fraction of phage biodiversity is captured by sequenced genomes; in fact, phages are by far the most under-sequenced genetic entity. As Next Generation Sequencing advances, the flow of phage DNA sequence is going to increase enormously. However, phage genomes represent special problems in genomic analysis, in part because of biological factors, including rapid sequence divergence, the compression of gene sizes and extensive gene overlap. Even more problematic is the general lack of expertise in phage biology, which makes quality annotation of phage genomes inaccessible to most of the scientific public.<br/><br/>The project will implement scalable infrastructure for bioinformatics analyses, focusing on the automated structural and functional annotation of phages. Publicly accessible infrastructure will be developed and deployed, from new and existing components to support community re-annotation of paradigm phages into ""gold standard"" curated annotation sets. Additionally the infrastructure will develop components focused on the acquisition and annotation of new phage genomes going forward, as the field of bacteriophage genomics rapidly expands. Tools will be developed and released encoding expert annotation knowledge to improve the state of the art in automated, quality, phage annotation. The entire project will be developed as open source software under an OSI approved license, permitting the re-implementation of the project's infrastructure in other genome annotation communities where it will provide value.

These goals are being achieved by hosting activities geared toward student recruitment and retention while building a mentoring network of students and alumni. The alumni mentors are helping to direct the students in their career and future success. The project has four objectives: (1) grow the existing EES program at UTRGV with the specific aim to recruit and retain students in geoscience; (2) increase community awareness of Earth systems; (3) guide community college and high school students into geoscience careers; and (4) expose undergraduate students to research as a path to graduate school. These objectives are being achieved through: pairing undergraduate majors with alumni who are working in the field of interest of the student; encouraging the transfer of community college students into the EES program at UTRGV through field trips, guest speakers, and an annual alumni career day; and expanding undergraduate research opportunities by engaging students in ongoing projects. The project also is awarding fifty scholarships to five cohorts of students over three years. SHIP-GEO contributes to the NSF's goal of increasing diversity in the geoscience pipeline by attracting, supporting and preparing Hispanic students for careers in geosciences in South Texas, and is expected to become one of the best-known programs in the nation for producing quality Hispanic geoscientists."

Current processes deployed in cellulosic biofuel facilities use a mixture of enzymes to convert the cellulosic fractions to fermentable sugars.  However, this process is still fairly slow and is the most expensive step in cellulosic biofuels production, in part because lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to enzymatic attack and breakdown.  This recalcitrance is due to the complexity of lignocellulose structure at the molecular and microscopic levels.  Therefore, before enzyme treatment, the lignocellulosic biomass is pretreated, typically with a combination of steam and chemicals, to open up the pores in the biomass so that the enzyme can be more effective.  There is a need to develop a better, molecular level understanding of the biomass breakdown processes to identify new strategies optimize or eliminate pretreatment and improve the rate of conversion to realize cost reduction.  The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how lignocellulosic biomass is broken down, or deconstructed, during enzyme treatment so that these new cost-saving strategies can be identified.  The innovative aspect of this study is the combination of molecular modeling and molecular chemical imaging to discover more about this complex process.  The educational activities associated with this project feature the development of a workbook on the conversion of biomass to biofuels for use in summer youth programs.<br/><br/>Lignocellulosic biomass is a three-dimensional biopolymer matrix of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin ordered at multiple scales ranging from the molecular scale to the microscale.  The complexity of the lignocellulosic matrix has long been recognized as a key limiting factor in the efficiency of its enzymatic hydrolysis to fermentable sugars. This research will combine dynamic modeling and molecular imaging to gain new insights into the real-time dynamics of lignocellulosic molecular and fine structure changes during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars using mixtures of hydrolytic enzymes. To accomplish this goal, the research has three objectives.  The first objective is to gain a fundamental, quantitative understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the recalcitrance lignocellulosic biomass fine structure to enzymatic attack.  The second objective is to establish relationships between cell wall component composition and molecular structural organization with hydrolysis processing conditions and correlate these relationships to biomass deconstruction efficiency.  The third objective is to develop a mechanistic modeling framework capable of simulating biomass deconstruction under realistic hydrolysis conditions with comprehensive consideration of substrate morphology and component distribution.  These objectives will be enabled through single-molecule imaging via Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and chemical imaging via Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) of the biomass deconstruction process during enzymatic treatment. Outcomes from the proposed research will enable the rational design of enzyme cocktails and processing conditions to overcome the factors that slow down the hydrolytic reactions, leading to optimal design of the hydrolysis bioreactor systems and cost reduction of cellulosic biofuel manufacturing systems."

The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation-wide activity that offers the most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of this study lie in two complementary contributions of the project. First, the development of the statistical framework for the design of multilevel mediation studies has significant potential for broad impact because it develops a core platform that is transferable to other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education areas and STEM disciplines. Second, the development of software and curricular materials to implement this framework further capitalize on the promise of this work because it distributes the results in an accessible manner to diverse sets of research and practitioner groups across STEM education areas and STEM disciplines. Together, the components of this project will substantially expand the scope and quality of evidence generated through mathematics professional development and, more generally, multilevel mediation studies throughout STEM areas by increasing researchers' capacity to design valid and comprehensive studies of the theories of action and change that underlie research programs.<br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive framework to inform and guide the analytic design of teacher professional development studies in mathematics. The proposed framework incorporates four integrated research and education components: (1) develop statistical formulas and tools to guide the optimal design of experimental and non-experimental multilevel mediation studies in the presence of measurement error, (2) develop empirical estimates of the parameters needed to implement these formulas to design teacher development studies in mathematics, (3) develop free and accessible software to execute this framework, and (4) develop training materials and conduct workshops on the framework to improve the capacity of the field to design effective and efficient studies of teacher development. An essential goal of the research is to advance a science of teaching and learning in ways that traverse both research and education."

However, despite all the efforts devoted to investigating the SSW, two fundamental questions about this type of wind remain unanswered: (1) where does the SSW originate in the corona; and, (2) how do the coronal plasma properties determine the in-situ heavy ion composition of the SSW?  This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the coronal origins of the SSW in order to answer these two important science questions.  The project team will study the SSW, utilizing two completely different techniques: in-situ measurements of local wind plasma properties, and remote-sensing spectral or imaging observations. When combined together, these two techniques can become a formidable tool that allows the investigators to fully exploit their potential to study the origin of the SSW.  This project will benefit the solar research community and serve important educational functions.  By using two completely different measurement techniques, this project will serve as a bridge between two different solar physics communities that have been working in parallel with limited interaction: the in-situ community and the remote sensing community, and will thus stimulate a new wave of cross collaborations.  The research will be carried out at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where it will support undergraduate education through the University's UROP program and graduate education through collaboration with the graduate students in our department.  The project will also support a young female postdoc, thus helping her establish a career as a woman in STEM disciplines.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the origin of the solar wind.  In order to achieve this goal, the project team will utilize in-situ measurements from ACE/SWICS and SWEPAM, Ulysses/SWICS, SWOOPS and Wind/SWE and combine the analysis with remote-sensing data from SOHO/MDI, SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT.  The in-situ solar wind observations will be classified based on their coronal origin types rather then their in-situ properties.  Back-tracking methods will be used to identify the corresponding source regions on the Sun.  The physical properties of the solar wind source regions will be determined using spectral line intensities.  This research project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the origin of the solar wind.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond."

The functionality of such material systems depends partly on the interactions between the metal with the oxide support, down to the atomic bonding at the interface. Atomic-level characterization of interfaces is challenging because interfaces are complex structures buried within the bulk. Characterization is especially difficult in a system involving gamma-alumina, which is an excellent carrier for catalytic metal nanoparticles because of its extremely high surface area, but it is also structurally fragile and thermally sensitive. Novel processing methods are combined with highly advanced electron microscopy techniques to reveal the atomic structure at the interface between this metastable phase of aluminum oxide and widely used metal catalysts such as platinum and palladium. Experimental characterization is paired with computational models that are based on the fundamental relationships describing bonding between materials to further elucidate the relationship between the structure and properties. This project provides training and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and engages high school students from underrepresented groups in the exploration of science and engineering. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Gamma-alumina is a widely used support for metal nanoparticles in industrial chemical production and catalytic converters. Although it is known that the catalyst activity is affected by metal-support interactions, the understanding of the atomic-level structure and thermodynamic properties of the metal/gamma-alumina interfaces is incomplete. The goal of this research is to examine the extent to which the local atomic structure of gamma-alumina is affected by the structure and the chemistry of the metal species at the interface. This work assesses if dense nanostructured material with a high gamma-alumina/metal interfacial area can stabilize the system enough to enable atomic-level characterization. The microstructural complexity of metal/alumina systems, the metastability of the alumina phase, and the susceptibility of alumina to damage during transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have limited atomic-level structural characterization of the interfaces in these complex systems. In this project innovative processing paths are used to create stabilized nanostructured materials that may be characterized with aberration-corrected TEM. Qualitative atomic-level structural characterization of the interfaces between the alumina and select metals (e.g., Pt, Pd) is achieved using aberration-corrected TEM. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate the optimal configuration and interfacial energy of candidate structural models of the interfaces. The research objective is to use the overlap between the experimental characterization and the structural calculations to validate the interfacial structures and thermodynamic stability ranges calculated with DFT methods in these complex, metastable systems, and to connect the structural information to the thermodynamic properties of the interface, including the interfacial free energy. Graduate students involved in the project are trained in advanced TEM, data analysis techniques and in computational methods of DFT for calculating the atomic structure of the interfaces. Undergraduate students are also involved in these main research activities. Outreach activities for high school students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering introduce them to experimental methods for materials characterization and to how computational techniques are used to study atomic bonding."

The intellectual merit of this research consists of challenging the false choice between creating software that is extensible (easy to reuse and extend) and software that is correct (meets its specifications). The new approach advanced by this work, Incremental Verification-Validation, enables programmers to bring domain-specific safely disciplines to extensible systems, by providing a framework where these disciplines are communicated both precisely and usefully, as executable code.  The project's broader significance and importance consist in changing the way programmers approach building correct extensible software for the web. The research targets ECMAScript (JavaScript), enabling this research to have a direct impact on the vast number of languages and systems that create and use JavaScript.  Further, the project represents a new collaboration across the University of Colorado and University of Maryland, bringing together experts across verification, incremental computing, and runtime systems. Finally, this project benefits the graduate and undergraduate teaching mission at the participating universities, as aspects of the project enriches the program analysis and programming language courses.<br/><br/>Incremental Verification-Validation encourages programmers to co-design their systems with executable specifications that check these systems dynamically, as they execute. Moreover, unlike typical assertions, which execute dynamically and non-incrementally, the proposed  are subject to novel patterns that enhance their performance: In regressive validation, verification partially discharges some checks, dynamically rewriting the program with residual versions; in progressive verification, online verification occurs in passes that each cache and reuse work, to avoid from-scratch verification of facts that still hold from earlier passes. Finally, to avoid forcing analysis programmers to reason about incremental changes explicitly in each analysis that they create, the meta layer expresses incremental computations implicitly, using an implicitly-incremental meta language whose abstractions hide reasoning on a per-change basis."

The NNS problem is one of the central computational problems arising when dealing with modern massive datasets.  For example, it underlies a classical classification rule in machine learning: to label a new object (such as an image), one can simply find the most similar objects (the nearest neighbors) in a preprocessed database, and use the label of the objects found. More generally, NNS is a key algorithmic tool in many areas including databases, data mining, information retrieval, computer vision, computational geometry, signal processing, bioinformatics, and others.  In such applications, the objects are usually represented in a high-dimensional space: e.g., a 20x20 image is naturally represented by a 400-dimensional vector, with one coordinate per pixel.<br/><br/>The PI intends to study the high-dimensional NNS problem, by addressing both foundational algorithmic questions, as well as applied aspects. The project aims for both scientific and educational impact. First, the study of the NNS problem is instrumental in developing fundamental concepts in areas such as high-dimensional computational geometry as well as sublinear space algorithms (including concepts such as dimension reduction, sketching, metric embeddings, etc). Second, due to the numerous applications of NNS, its efficient implementations are used widely in industry. Overall, the PI aims to foster a stronger connection between the theory and practice of NNS by code dissemination, public lectures, and student training. The PI's affiliation with Columbia's Data Science Institute puts the PI in a particularly good position to accomplish these goals.<br/><br/>To accomplish the project's algorithmic goals, the PI will leverage the recently developed approach of data-dependent hashing, where the hash function itself adapts to a given dataset. As a proof-of-concept, the PI and co-authors recently demonstrated that this new approach to NNS leads to algorithms outperforming the classical NNS algorithms (such as those based on the Locality-Sensitive Hashing). The project aims to develop this methodology further to its maturity, extend it to other relevant metrics (similarity measures) which have traditionally resisted efficient solutions, develop practical versions of the algorithms, and to understand the limits of these techniques."

Massive efforts to sample the chemical constituents present in well water can reduce uncertainty in mapping of hazardous materials in groundwater. Observations of chemical reactions at the sub-micron scale may lead to new insights about the behavior of toxic trace elements in soils. However, the value of these expensive efforts to collect massive amounts of data will not be fully realized if the statistical techniques for analyzing them do not keep pace. The current techniques available are inadequate to flexibly model and extract information from massive datasets consisting of many variables collected across a region. This research project aims to develop computationally efficient methods for addressing the central challenges for analyzing massive multivariate spatial data: (1) drawing justifiable conclusions about the relationships among the multiple variables, and (2) making full and appropriate use of all variables when mapping the data. Addressing the first challenge is essential to translating observational and experimental data into scientific knowledge. Addressing the second is crucially important for providing predictions of potentially harmful outcomes, and the key to solving both challenges is integrating the multivariate and spatial data analysis into a unified framework.<br/><br/>The inherent correlation in time series and spatial data is the feature that makes interpolation and forecasting possible, but it also complicates estimation of multivariate relationships. As a result, analyses of time series data often start with a transformation of the data into the spectral domain, in which the transformed data are approximately uncorrelated. Although the spectral domain has played a central role in developing theory for models for spatial data, several issues have hindered the implementation of practical spectral domain methods for spatial data. This project aims to develop methodological innovations to overcome those barriers and provide practitioners with a flexible set of tools to extract information from dozens of spatial variables simultaneously, and predict variables at unsampled locations using all of the available data. The methods employ computationally efficient periodic data augmentations to simplify analyses, dramatically improve the ability to characterize uncertainty, and are supported by novel theoretical results."

Although it is a complex disease with many interacting factors, there is agreement that a major component is dysfunction of the pancreatic beta cells that release the hormone insulin. In normal individuals, these cells release insulin in pulses, with the pulse amplitude reflecting the glucose level. There is now conclusive evidence that pulsatile insulin is more effective than constant insulin at stimulating glucose-lowering actions of the liver. In addition, it has been shown that type II diabetics, and their nearest relatives, show disorganized insulin levels, rather than the more regular insulin pulses of non-diabetics. This project seeks to better understand the intracellular pathways that result in pulsatile insulin secretion from beta cells. It also seeks to understand how mice, which also exhibit pulsatile insulin secretion, compensate for genetic knockouts of key proteins in such a way that rhythmic cellular activity and insulin secretion is maintained. Overall, the project will yield insights into the complex biology of pulsatile insulin secretion, and will push forward mathematical analysis techniques that are useful in complex intracellular signaling systems such as those in pancreatic beta cells. Graduate students involved in this research project will receive broad interdisciplinary training in answering mathematical questions driven by experimental data. Publicly available software will also be produced. <br/><br/>The Dual Oscillator Model has been under continuous development by Bertram and associates since it was first published in 2004. This model describes how three signaling pathways, metabolism, intracellular calcium dynamics, and electrical activity combine to produce pulsatile insulin secretion that is modulated by the extracellular glucose level. The complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand the dynamics of the system, but application of the fast/slow analysis technique allows one to take advantage of the separation of time scales of the model variables and formally decompose the system into subsystems that vary at different rates. This powerful multi-scale analysis technique will be applied to improve our understanding of oscillations in activity of the model beta cell that are induced by glucose and other substrates, as well as oscillations that are present in cells from mice in which different key proteins are genetically knocked out. Because there are several slowly changing variables, there are a number of different ways in which the fast/slow analysis technique can be used. These different approaches are explored, and will yield complementary insights. While the focus of the project is on oscillations in beta cell activity, the analysis approach used is applicable to a wide range of dynamic models, so the mathematical developments made in this project can be adapted to other complex biological systems."

Ecologists have suggested that the reason for this pattern is that higher levels of food resources for life are found in the tropics.  This project will perform a direct test of that hypothesis by making measurements of biodiversity and food resource levels in streams across a broad latitudinal gradient. In each of eight study regions, fishes and invertebrates will be intensively sampled. The data will be used by the researcher to develop mathematical models of the relationships between the average size of individuals and the abundance of those individuals within a community as a means of testing the idea about biodiversity and resources. This project will also focus on engaging underrepresented minorities in freshwater research. In each of four years, a group of three minority undergraduates will be trained to conduct stream surveys, to analyze original data, and to present results at the annual meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science, for a total of 12 undergraduates mentored throughout the project. One Ph.D. student identified as an underrepresented minority student also will be trained to compete for leadership-level positions in environmental research or management.<br/><br/>An empirical test of species-energy theory within stream ecosystems will be conducted in three steps. In Step-1, size-spectra (scaling relationships between average individual body mass and population abundance) will be quantified in each of the eight study regions and used to model the distribution of abundance among primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers. Nitrogen stable isotope samples and published feeding behaviors will also be used to assess whether trophic position is a consistent function of body size. Systematic, among-site comparisons of size-spectra models will then test whether the scaling of abundance with individual body mass and trophic position is constant among tropical and temperate streams. In Step-2, species-abundance distributions will be compiled for each study stream then compared among streams to assess whether species richness increases more rapidly, relative to a constant number of individuals, in tropical streams. In Step-3, supplementary fish and invertebrate data from National Ecological Observatory Network streams will be used to test for seasonal or inter-annual differences in the size-spectra and species-abundance distribution models."

An example of such a problem is calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of the local gravitational field.  Only rarely can such inverse problems be solved analytically, and in general numerical approximations are required to find solutions. In this research project, the investigators aim to introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems, develop its theoretical and computational properties, and establish its performance in applications.  It is anticipated that the new algorithm will be adaptable to a range of problems currently under investigation in applied and numerical mathematics, for example in solving a sparse system of linear equations, currently of great interest in areas including tomography, archaeology, astrophysics, and other sciences.<br/><br/>This research project explores a novel iterative algorithm for the solution of a class inverse problems that includes Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, Laplace transform inversion, mixing distribution estimation in statistics, and solving sparse systems of linear equations. The investigators plan to (i) introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems of these types, and perhaps others, (ii) develop its theoretical and computational properties, and (iii) establish its performance in applications. A motivation for the research is the statistical problem of estimating a mixing density in a nonparametric mixture model. To date, there are no general algorithms that produce globally consistent estimators of the mixing density, in the sense of almost sure convergence with respect to a strong metric; only weak convergence results are available.

An example of such a problem is calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of the local gravitational field.  Only rarely can such inverse problems be solved analytically, and in general numerical approximations are required to find solutions. In this research project, the investigators aim to introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems, develop its theoretical and computational properties, and establish its performance in applications.  It is anticipated that the new algorithm will be adaptable to a range of problems currently under investigation in applied and numerical mathematics, for example in solving a sparse system of linear equations, currently of great interest in areas including tomography, archaeology, astrophysics, and other sciences.<br/><br/>This research project explores a novel iterative algorithm for the solution of a class inverse problems that includes Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, Laplace transform inversion, mixing distribution estimation in statistics, and solving sparse systems of linear equations. The investigators plan to (i) introduce a novel iterative algorithm for solving inverse problems of these types, and perhaps others, (ii) develop its theoretical and computational properties, and (iii) establish its performance in applications. A motivation for the research is the statistical problem of estimating a mixing density in a nonparametric mixture model. To date, there are no general algorithms that produce globally consistent estimators of the mixing density, in the sense of almost sure convergence with respect to a strong metric; only weak convergence results are available. An important feature of the algorithm under development is that, if it is initialized at a smooth density function, then the estimator is necessarily also a smooth density function.

Further, dark matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however the particle properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery. The combined activities of the UIC group address those basic questions puzzling science - the origin of mass and the particle nature of dark matter - and have the potential for surprising discoveries that may change the way we understand our physical world.<br/><br/>The award also supports technological advances for high energy frontier experiments, in particular building and commissioning sophisticated high-speed electronics and silicon tracking systems for particle physics experiments.  The challenges faced in advancing those technologies enhance the disciplinary knowledge in engineering fields. The data analyses and hardware projects supported by this award provide valuable experience and knowledge for students and post doctoral associates at UIC, enabling them to pursue successful careers in the private sector, academia, or research laboratories. The UIC group also fosters close collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high schools. As these high schools serve predominantly minority students, this project aims to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups that major in STEM disciplines."

This is an exciting time for the maturing field of gravitational-wave physics. Construction of Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory), an overhaul of the Initial LIGO interferometers, is now complete and the first couple months of data have been collected. The advanced detectors made last year the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a momentous event that will transform our understanding of the universe and marks the beginning of a new field of gravitational wave astronomy. Predicted by Einstein nearly 100 years ago, gravitational waves are distortions of space-time created by the movements of massive astrophysical objects such as exploding stars and coalescing black holes or neutron stars. The effect of gravitational waves on space-time is minuscule, however, and necessitates the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. This award supports research to improve the Advanced LIGO sensitivity at low frequencies and increase the amount of time the detector is collecting science quality data. In addition, this program will serve as an invaluable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students who will develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines and prepare them to fill positions in academia and industry. The group is strongly committed to sharing the excitement of the field with the public through outreach at all levels, reaching out in particular to the communities in Mississippi.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves can be detected by using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located two-and-a-half miles (4 km) away from one another. The mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all vibrations other than the gravitational wave. The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved a sensitivity to changes in the distance between the mirrors of better than one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. There nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve the interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. One such challenge arises from the design of the commercial seismometers that are used to provide active vibration isolation of the mirrors. The seismometers cannot distinguish between horizontal acceleration of the ground and tilt of the ground. This award supports the development of a high precision tilt-free seismometer to improve the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation. The project includes deriving updated requirements for a tilt-free seismometer based on data from the observatories, designing and modeling the instrument, constructing and measuring the performance of the tilt-free seismometer and conducting a theoretical and experimental noise analysis of the system."

With an increasing number of backyard and community gardens, our society is already gradually transitioning to producing food within the city. But can urban agriculture be more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional farming? Are environmental impacts always greater than environmental benefits in agriculture? How can we use existing environmental impact and environmental benefit modeling approaches to estimate ?net and absolute sustainability? of agriculture? In this project, we will answer these types of questions in a collaborative effort from University of Toledo (UT), University of Utah (UU), and Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). Current local food movement will further strengthen and be guided by scientific understanding if our results show that urban agriculture has net environmental benefits.<br/><br/>This project aims to have impact in both research and global engagement. Students from all three institutions will train and collaborate virtually for two semesters prior to UT and UU students traveling to UAB for two months.

Students and principal investigators will model tomato production in rooftop greenhouses and community gardens in three cities: Toledo, Salt Lake City, and Barcelona. Life cycle assessment will be used to estimate environmental impacts. Ecosystem services models will be used to estimate environmental benefits. The impacts and benefits will be added to estimate ?absolute environmental sustainability? for agricultural systems. Multiple scales will be analyzed as we compare results at individual versus city wide implementation to derive conclusions for facility managers, utility managers, design engineers, and urban planners.

Many important DNA sequencing methods require a length-based sorting of DNA longer than 1000-10,000 bases. The most common method to accomplish this is pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which requires 12-36 hours to complete and presents a significant bottleneck. The proposed method instead uses low viscosity, water-based solutions of surfactants instead of gels, and is expected to perform the same function as mentioned in gel electrophoresis but with runtimes of less than five minutes. Additionally, the low-viscosity solutions used are easy to inject into capillaries and microchips and do not suffer from clogging and degradation with repeated use. Incorporation of this rapid, gel-free method into critical DNA sequencing procedures could greatly decrease the cost of sequencing methods used in forensic identification and biology research such as genome mapping and pathogen identification. One Ph.D student, three M.S. students, and five undergraduates will be trained in colloid and interface science, organic chemistry, and bioseparations as they contribute to the project. Single-molecule DNA visualization studies will be built into demonstrations for K-12 student outreach, and lab modules for undergraduate courses will be developed based on microchip electrophoresis.<br/><br/>This project will research a rapid, non-gel means to separate double strand DNA greater than 10-100 kilobases (kB) in length as required for genome mapping and other applications using inexpensive, widely available capillary electrophoresis equipment. The method uses transiently attached wormlike micelles as drag-tags, which, when attached to DNA by a terminal n-alkane group, provide a length-dependent electrophoretic mobility without the use of a sieving matrix. Specific objectives of the project aims are: (1) to design and implement substituted peptide nucleic acid staples to attach alkyl groups to the ends of 48.5 kB lambda-DNA and its digests; (2) to screen a series of nonionic micelle buffers to obtain the largest drag-tag size possible; (3) to develop a theory predicting the mobility of the DNA by consideration of DNA-drag-tag segregation effects in networks of varying pore size and micelle lifetimes; and (4) to perform single-molecule imaging of DNA to assess the extent of DNA-drag-tag segregation. The proposed work will identify optimal buffers and run conditions for a given set of DNA lengths to be separated and identify limits of DNA length and runtime that can be achieved. Insights into the perturbation of wormlike micelle entanglements by vicinal hydrophobes may also help better understand the rheological behavior of these solutions in the presence of contaminants."

Wasserman & Peter A. Beck, Environmental Science & Policy, St. Edward's University<br/><br/><br/>Non-technical Project Description<br/><br/>Biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution are major threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life, especially for societies that directly depend upon the local environment for resources.  Addressing human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems. These ecosystems contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate change mitigation through carbon storage, and filter pollutants from water and air.  However, traditional conservation strategies that exclude local populations have often been ineffective leading to significant forest loss over the past several decades.  This NSF IRES research program will evaluate the effectiveness of alternative conservation strategies to maintain tropical forest ecosystems and primate populations, while also maintaining the livelihoods of local communities surrounding the forests.  Through this research program, underrepresented students in the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience.  The investigators will integrate ecological and social research methods to address questions critical to fields of ecology, anthropology, and environmental policy, address current environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, and provide STEM training for underrepresented students at two biological field stations in Costa Rica (La Selva and Las Cruces) in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies.  Students will work closely with Costa Rican field assistants and local communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange.  Interested Costa Rican university students will be included in the projects and encouraged to apply for the master's program in environmental management and sustainability at St. Edward's University.  At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and Costa Rican scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences.  An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure to a developing country.  Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods, particularly in tropical forest regions.  <br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities.  Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation.  Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.  Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks.  However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached in developing countries, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas.  As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives.  Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations.  Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1. To quantify how policies integrating conservation and development objectives, such as ecotourism, academic research activities, and multiple-use protected areas, influence tropical forests and their primates, as well as how effective these environmental policies are at maintaining human livelihoods.  2. To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in the environmental sciences.  To meet these objectives, student projects will examine differences in forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, carbon storage, diversity) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, population size) across a number of forests at and surrounding Las Cruces and La Selva Biological Stations in Costa Rica that are protected for various objectives (i.e., ecotourism, research, national conservation).  Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how this influences local perception of environmental policy.  Specifically, 15 ten-week independent master's student research projects will occur across a three-year period to survey primate populations, quantify behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays in country (an environmental endocrinology laboratory will be established in Costa Rica), conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, other stakeholders, and tourists, and quantify forest characteristics.  By examining interactions between people, parks, and primates through independent, yet interrelated, student projects, we will be able to provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of private ecotourism, public protected areas, and academic research stations to maintain livelihoods for human populations and promote conservation of biodiversity.  Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic, participatory, and research incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes.  As a breakdown in either natural ecosystems or human society will negatively affect the other, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain both biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually promoting sustainability and conservation."

This exclusion gives rise to a force called the depletion force, which can draw particles together to form aggregates.  Some industrial processes take advantage of the depletion force by promoting aggregation of contaminant particles to remove them from solution.  However, the depletion force may be undesirable in other processes where ingredients must remain in solution, such as paint pigment particles or active agents in pharmaceuticals. Such liquid products must be formulated to prevent depletion-induced aggregation. When ionic surfactants are also present in the polymer solution, they can bind to the polymers and alter the depletion force in ways that are not completely understood. This project will examine various kinds of polymer/surfactant mixtures to better understand how polymer-surfactant binding influences the depletion force and the stability of the suspension. A colloidal probe atomic force microscope will be used to measure the depletion force in the polymer/surfactant mixtures. The results of the project will be useful to engineers who manufacture and process colloidal fluids, including paints, coatings, topical medications, and personal care products. The project will provide research opportunities for students at various academic levels, including middle school students who participate in the university's Physics Concepts Programs by designing experiments to examine the physical chemistry of liquid product formulations. <br/><br/>This project will examine the role of polymer/surfactant complexation on depletion forces in colloidal suspensions. Colloidal forces in polymer/surfactant mixtures will be measured by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. The project will reveal how complexation between ionic surfactants and either nonionic polymers or oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can amplify or suppress depletion forces. Experimental data will be interpreted in terms of a model that predicts depletion forces based on polymer/surfactant complex stoichiometry, charge and size. Results will be correlated with colloidal stability phase diagrams for a series of systems that represent canonical categories of polymer/surfactant association behavior. The outcomes of the project will benefit industrial practice where complexation is used in multicomponent liquid mixtures to produce novel material properties and products with diminished environmental impacts."

However, many science teachers have no training in this area. Therefore, there is an urgent need to train teachers in the concepts of engineering design and methods for teaching it. There is also a need to collect research evidence on how teachers develop knowledge for teaching science through engineering design and the effect of their teaching practices on student learning. This research project is training pre-service science teachers in engineering design, developing their knowledge for teaching science through engineering design, and assessing the impact on their students' learning of and attitudes towards engineering design and science. Results from the project are providing research evidence on the development of pre-service teachers' knowledge of teaching science through engineering design, the resulting instructional practices, and the impact on student learning and attitude towards engineering design and science. This project will impact at least 1000 high school students directly, teaching them principle of engineering design. The impact of the project will be further magnified through the development of a manual on effective approaches for teaching engineering design in high schools. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to provide proven resources for preparing the future workforce for engineering challenges of the future.<br/><br/>The New Framework for K-12 Science Education, and the Next Generation Science Education Standards accentuate the integration of engineering design in K-12 science classrooms. However, many science teachers lack knowledge of engineering design.  Likewise, there is a paucity of research on science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering design integrated science (EDIS) teaching, and its effect on student achievement in engineering design and science. Clearly, the success of engineering design in K-12 science will largely depend on teachers' understanding of engineering design and their pedagogical content knowledge of EDIS teaching. Therefore, this study is addressing four objectives: train high school pre-service science teachers in engineering design; measure the development of the pre-service science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering design integrated science instruction; facilitate pre-service teachers' implementation of EDIS units in high schools; and assess the effect of the pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering integrated science instruction on students' learning of and attitudes towards engineering design and science. The sample is comprised of two cohorts of 34 pre-service science teachers and 1428 high school students. The project is employing a two-cohort cluster randomized trial with repeated measures design of pre- and post-measures, where high school science classes serve as the cluster level.  Each pre-service teacher is teaching two science classes in high schools. Two classes nested within each pre-service teacher are divided into two groups, Traditional group and Engineering Design group. The Traditional group serves as a baseline for comparison to the Engineering Design group. Data is being collected using the Pedagogical Content Knowledge of EDIS Science Teaching instrument, the Engineering Design Skills and Engineering Design Attitudes questionnaire, Knowledge Integration Content Knowledge tests, the Engineering Design Process Knowledge Instrument, and the revised Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Multilevel and structural equation modeling and analytic induction are the data analysis techniques. The results will provide empirical evidence on the development of pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of EDIS teaching, the resulting instructional practices, and the impact on student learning and attitude towards engineering design and science. The project will significantly impact pre-service science teachers' engineering design skills, instructional practice, and student learning and attitude towards engineering design."

Such systems have become increasingly pervasive, from intelligent manufacturing systems to smart homes to automobiles. The existing intelligent technologies aim at reducing human workload and increasing system safety, yet they also bring new safety concerns. These concerns are particularly essential in emergency situations, in which the human operator may be required to make decisions under time pressure and high-level stress. The decisions made in these situations are often the most important ones that can cause severe safety issues. This CRII project investigates influential factors for human-CPS system safety in emergency situations, using the semi-autonomous driving system as a concrete domain. The project outcome will improve our understanding of the safety-critical factors for semi-autonomous driving, inform the future design of other human-CPS systems, and ultimately lead to a more efficient and safe world.<br/><br/>Specifically, the inclusion of human drivers in the semi-autonomous systems makes the control tasks of the system more difficult because the controller must allow for unanticipated input from the human driver. Most existing work on the safety of such systems assumes a priori models that are expected to fully characterize human behaviors. However, such assumptions may become invalid when the human operator has to make a decision in emergency situations, such as car crashes or malfunctions. The goal of this project is to investigate systematically how the human-CPS system as a whole reacts to such situations and examine influential factors of the human driver, the vehicle sub-system, and the interaction. The proposed assessment measures of system safety in emergency situations include human performance in response to unexpected hazardous events, and human decision making during vehicle malfunctions caused by cyber attacks."

The advanced knowledge acquired leads to a greater understanding of molecular transport and could help optimize performance for industrial gas separations and the development of environmentally friendly methods to carry out industrial oxidation reactions.  The educational component of this award encompasses three areas:  (1) it trains graduate students in research and prepares them for future careers in science or engineering fields; (2) it supports the first research experiences of undergraduates and high school students; and (3) it broadly promotes interest in science by bringing chemists into South Carolina's K-12 classrooms to showcase the scientific method and to foster interest in chemistry and in the natural sciences, especially at high minority enrollment middle schools and high schools.<br/><br/>Bottom-up approaches to design functional materials through molecular self-assembly provide an efficient and high fidelity strategy to prepare well-defined nanostructures that can be used to answer fundamental questions.  In this research project, the Shimizu group prepares structurally tunable 1-dimensional nanochannels by controlling the self-assembly of simple macrocyclic building blocks.  These nanochannels are used for three main purposes: (1) to study the rates of transporting gas or guest molecules through the channels as a function of the channel dimensions, guest dimensions, and the interactions that can occur between the guests and the channel walls.  (2) to organize molecules that can interact with light and to study the effect of this organization on their properties, and (3) to generate a reactive form of oxygen, singlet oxygen, and to control the oxidation of organic substrates."

The end of the last Ice Age provides an outstanding opportunity to probe this question since it featured the collapse of major ice sheets and abrupt mult-meter jumps in sea level that remain to be fully explained. This project will focus on reconstructing the three-dimensional collapse of the New England sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, the largest of the Ice Age ice masses. <br/><br/>This research will first constrain the timing and rate of ice sheet thinning in New England by measuring surface exposure ages of glacial boulders down the sides of a dozen large mountains -- revealing when the ice sheet surface lowered below various elevations, much like rings in a bathtub. These vertical datapoints will then be combined with the well-constrained horizontal ice margin retreat history in the region to produce three-dimensional reconstructions of the ice sheet collapse through time. These reconstructions will enable an assessment of this region's contribution to deglacial sea level rise, freshwater input to the ocean and possible impacts on its circulation, and how the ice sheet responded to the abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation -- all critical for testing computer models used to predict the future."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising social science scholar studying the costs and consequences borne by U.S. households as an outcome of local, state and federal immigration enforcement activity; and to examine the impacts of these financial burdens on everyday household decision-making, socio-economic vulnerability and long-term assimilation.  he research has significant implications for U.S. immigration and boundary enforcement policy. For example, research already conducted in immigrant-sending communities shows how enforcement activity produces significant financial hardships that have counter-intuitive outcomes, driving patterns of unlawful migration as households and extended family networks seek to spread and mitigate risk. In cities like Tucson and Detroit, immigrant households concentrate disproportionately in low-income enclaves where residents deal with the burdens of under- or marginal employment; under-performing schools; high rates of crime; unstable housing conditions; and exclusion from mainstream financial institutions. This research examines the strategies used by such households to meet the acute financial burdens associated with a household member's exposure to immigration detention and removal, and how these strategies affect household members' short- and long-term socio-economic opportunities, vulnerabilities, and assimilation into the fabric of U.S. life. A key feature of the research involves the recruitment, training, coaching and supervision of bilingual first-generation undergraduate students, who will assist in the collection and analysis of data and dissemination of research results. The involvement of these students is intended to encourage their completion of a four-year degree and to increase their familiarity with and excitement about SBE-related fields. At the conclusion of research activities, the PI and sponsoring scientist will conduct a program evaluation with participating undergraduate student researchers. This will allow for assessment of research, training and mentorship activities, and will inform the dissemination of the research and training model for broader application and use by peer scholars and educators.<br/><br/>Research data are collected using a 72-item, in-person detailed questionnaire, with questions related to household finances, assets, immigration history, and social networks of instrumental support used to mitigate risks (e.g., extended family who provide loans or childcare services in an emergency). Responses are entered into a central database and analyzed for bivariate and multivariate associations and compared to national and local estimates of wealth and debt obtained by the U.S. Census Bureau. For purposes of comparison, data will be collected in two research sites: Tucson, Arizona and Detroit, Michigan. The target sample size is 100 interviews in each site. Respondents are identified using canvassing and snowball sampling at sites where immigrant families receive services such as churches, clinics and other non-profit organizations. Bilingual undergraduate students are recruited in Tucson and Detroit to assist with data collection and data entry. Student researchers are recruited through the University of Arizona (UA)'s ASEMS program, which provides coaching and support to undergraduate students pursuing a degree in a STEM field; the UA's Department of Mexican-American Studies, which promotes the research opportunities described above to students enrolled in its classes; and Pima Community College's ""Upward Bound"" program, a U.S. Department of Education-funded initiative that provides first-generation, low-income students with coaching and support to accomplish a four-year college degree.

These organisms use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous dissolved in liquid medium to make lipids which can be processed into liquid transportation fuel.   Most algal biofuel processes require two stages.  In the first stage, the algae consume nutrients and grow.  In the second stage, the lipids used to make biofuel accumulate within the biomass, but only when all the nutrients are consumed so that the biomass does not grow any more.  In order to improve the economic viability of algae-based biofuels, it is necessary to develop strains of algae that can generate lipids for biofuel while producing more biomass that sustains the process. The goal of this project is re-program the gene networks in a model strain of algae named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to enhance both biofuel and biomass production at the same time.  The research will attempt to make the systems biology platform more generic that it can be extended to other organisms.  The educational activities associated with the project will develop high school curricular materials for renewable green biotechnology topics.<br/><br/>A critical challenge with algal biofuel production is that nutrient starvation is required to induce lipid accumulation.  The proposed research will develop a systems biology strategy to predictably manipulate regulatory and metabolic networks using the model photosynthetic green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in an effort to significantly enhance lipid accumulation without growth arrest.  A predictive Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) model will be developed to rationally identify gene targets for systems level re-engineering. The EGRIN model will be built upon a compendium of transcriptomes from cultures of C. reinhardtii grown in a diverse set of nutritional and environmental conditions.  Accuracy of the EGRIN model will be improved by incorporating experimentally mapped open chromatin structure. Further, the EGRIN model will be integrated with a metabolic network model to identify gene targets for engineering.  Finally, model-guided genome engineering of algae using CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be used to enhance biomass or lipid production.  The proposed research will generate a fundamental, model-guided strategy for predictably manipulating regulatory and metabolic networks in algae through a generalized approach which can be customized to perform similar strain engineering objectives other organisms."

The associated runoff to the adjacent oceans may have important impacts on marine ecosystems.   Meltwater characteristics, such as iron, sulfate and carbon content, are not well known and depend on the extent and activity of weathering reactions beneath the ice sheet. Microbes in these critical subglacial environments are important contributors of chemical weathering processes, yet, to date, direct molecular evidence of such processes remains to be obtained from GrIS subglacial environments. Here, the principal investigators propose to optimize methods to analyze samples obtained previously from GrIS subglacial meltwaters and to identify evidence of microbial activity in GrIS? subglacial meltwaters.  This is necessary background information required to develop models of the potential impact of increasing meltwater discharge from GrIS on local and downstream commercial fisheries.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM manpower development by offering research experience to an undergraduate student and mentoring to a female postdoctoral researcher.  Its public K-12 focused outreach efforts include workshops and exhibits at three annual Science Weekend experiences for the museum-going public at Seattle?s Pacific Science Center (Polar Science, Life Science Research, and UW PAWS on Science). Each event provides the possibility of one-on-one interactions with over 9000 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, allowing time to excite students during explanation of the ?Greenland ice microbes? exhibit and presentation of a hands-on mass spectrometry model.<br/><br/>This work will ultimately provide the first direct molecular evidence for enzymatic microbe-mediated nutrient cycling and remineralization (e.g., iron, sulfate, carbon release) underneath the GrIS. It constitutes the critical first step towards improving conceptual models of microbial GrIS weathering and its resulting impact on nutrient fluxes to future polar oceans. Specifically, the principal investigator anticipates that it will:<br/>1. Optimize protein extraction and environmental proteomics techniques for subglacial meltwater samples;<br/>2. Identify enzymes involved in microbial weathering and nutrient release to the ocean;<br/>3. Decipher molecular protective mechanisms that help microbes in the subglacial environment survive;<br/>4. Identify protein/peptide biomarkers to identify and quantify key metabolic processes in future subglacial studies; and<br/>5. Promote further discovery of novel cold-adaptive enzymes of significant interest to<br/>environmental ecologists and industrial scientists.<br/>Through these efforts, the PIs will demonstrate the ability to detect enzyme-controlled weathering, a prerequisite to quantify and track these processes in detail in the field (e.g., by combining geochemical measurements with targeted quantitative proteomics and 13C-isotopic tracer studies).  The success of this project has the potential to fundamentally change the way in which science views the effects of ice sheet melting. Identification and quantification of the microbial processes controlling weathering and nutrient availability is critical to the next generation of conceptual models ice sheet-ocean interaction."

As water flows through river networks, the materials it carries are transported, stored, processed, and released in response to changing physical, chemical and biological characteristics.  The goal of this project is to better understand how river systems process carbon, retain nutrients, influence ecosystem health globally, and ultimately support healthy ecosystems, both in the rivers and the water bodies into which they drain.  One of the concepts upon which river ecosystem science is founded is that rivers change their characteristics and processing rates with size and/or distance downstream.  This idea, called the River Continuum Concept (RCC), has helped organize decades of river research and management.  However, while the RCC has been a useful conceptual model, it remains relatively poorly tested, which seriously limits the ability of scientists to predict how river functions will respond to ongoing and future changes on Earth. This work seeks to fill that important knowledge gap about how rivers function, and thus has implications for how humans manage land and water resources.<br/><br/>One constraint to providing information about river function along the river continuum has been technological; we simply have not had the tools to measure these functions along river networks.  A second constraint has been that the simple conceptual model of the RCC neglects key features of rivers, specifically that they are frequently impacted by discontinuities like dams and lakes, tributary confluences, and geologic divides.  This project alleviates both constraints by coupling state-of-the-art water quality sensor technologies to new sampling methods in carefully selected river sites.  Together, these advances are expected to provide new insights about the river continuum, the role of discontinuities in changing river functions, and ultimately about how to best manage and protect aquatic resources."

This influx of migrants is straining the capacity of the U.S. immigration system to adjudicate their claims, and is taxing an already overburdened community of attorneys available to provide legal assistance.  One especially challenging issue that arises from these cases is that the nature of the dangers cited by applicants as motivating them to flee their home countries do not fit easily into the categories of persecution that are established in asylum law and related jurisprudence. This conference brings together leading social scientists with expertise on the conditions driving the migration from and on the psycho-social impacts of the migration experience, with legal scholars who specialize on refugee and asylum law. The objective is to share insights across disciplinary perspectives in order to enhance scholarship, and better to inform lawyers and other practitioners working with this population.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>In order to foster the cross-disciplinary collaboration that can inform the efficient, equitable adjudication of asylum cases submitted by newly arrived youth and families, this workshop will convene an international group of social scientists and legal scholars with expertise across three key priority areas: 1) country conditions; 2) psychological assessment of asylum seekers; and 3) asylum adjudication and evolving jurisprudence on asylum law in the U.S. The core objectives of the workshop will be to: 1) connect existing networks of researchers on socio-political dynamics in the region with behavioral scientists engaged in asylum seeker assessment and legal scholars on asylum law and adjudication processes; 2) develop an agenda for research to document forms of persecution in the region, informed by legal experts on substantive criteria and evidentiary standards for asylum claims; 3) discuss current scholarship on the applicability of refugee law to present-day humanitarian challenges and on refugee adjudication, and identify gaps in theoretical understandings of legal decision-making and methodological challenges to advancing research in this area; and 4) propose innovative, interdisciplinary approaches to analyzing adjudication outcomes of these cases as well as their influence on evolving jurisprudence on asylum claims."

This project will explore the properties of colloids to obtain a better understanding of the various phases (liquids, crystals, glasses) of atomic and molecular systems.  Colloids offer an advantage in this study since the location of individual particles can be tracked in 3D. In addition, the PI's will develop new techniques that will allow more control of the particles in the colloids.

This capability will be exploited in the work proposed to investigate new properties of the phase behavior of solids, including phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states, solid-solid phase transitions and the nature and dynamics of the amorphous state and the interfaces of crystalline materials. An important part of the project is the development of new experimental tools.  One of them is the ""electric bottle"", in which the particle density is controlled by dielectrophoresis.  New types of electrodes are being developed to aid in the study of phase transformations, in particular homogeneous crystal nucleation from the melt and solid-solid transformations.  A second tool being developed is a highly sensitive traction-force method for measuring the stress in a colloidal crystal or glass during deformation.  The tool will also present the rheology community with a new, highly sensitive instrument.

For example, speakers tend to say the word nine more quickly in the sentence A stitch in time saves nine than in the sentence The number I am thinking of is nine.  Some of these differences in timing are driven by our desire to help the listener understand us: the word nine is less predictable in the second sentence than it is in the first, so we lengthen it to give our listeners extra time to understand it.  Alternatively, speakers may shorten nine in the first sentence because it is easier to say. Slowing down and speeding up during speaking may give the production system the time it needs to plan and produce accurate, continuous speech.  This project examines the types of planning that occur during speech and the different ways they may affect our speaking rate. The results of this project may eventually lead to better interventions for individuals with speech disorders and to advances in designing artificial speech systems that sound more natural.<br/><br/>A puzzle for language researchers is understanding the factors that affect how speakers actualize specific words.  For example, the length of a given word is driven, at least in part, by how informative the word is in the discourse (e.g., how predictable it is, how much new information it provides, etc?). What is less well understood are the specific factors and mechanisms that underlie the timing and duration of each word. This project tests the hypothesis that different levels of linguistic planning have differential effects on time to articulation and word duration, a theory the investigator calls the ?two-domain hypothesis.? Under this hypothesis, lexical and conceptual planning influence the time to begin articulating a word, while planning processes related to phonological ordering affect the timing of producing the word itself.   Preliminary work suggests that when the process of encoding the order of a word?s sounds is complex, the word is lengthened.  On the other hand, when this phonological encoding proceeds smoothly, the word is shorter.  Preliminary experiments also suggest that lexical priming affects the time to begin a word?s articulation, but not the word?s duration. The proposed experiments use an event-description paradigm to test the predictions of the two-domain hypothesis and will lead to a better understanding of which aspects of planning influence word duration."

Existing monochromatic sources have low output power and/or highly divergent beams, which makes them unsuitable for important applications in terahertz sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy. This project aims to develop terahertz semiconductor lasers that could emit up to hundred milliwatts of average optical power in a narrow beam with less than five degrees of angular divergence. Such a performance is predicted for lasers operated in a compact cryocooler, and will be a significant improvement over present state-of-the-art. A new distributed-feedback scheme that allows phase-locking of multiple terahertz metallic cavities is proposed, which leads to significantly improved radiative efficiencies. The lasers will be developed with the semiconductor quantum-cascade technology that will allow integration of tens of different lasers, each emitting at a range of discrete frequencies, on a single semiconductor chip for broad spectral coverage. <br/>The availability of such integrated arrays of high-power terahertz lasers could lead to a transformative impact in the field of terahertz science and technology, by enabling development of cost-effective scientific-instruments for rapid non-invasive/remote sensing, detection, and analysis of a variety of chemicals and biomolecular species such as packaged drugs and explosives, pharmaceutical compounds, and biological samples. There is a strong probability that  new business directions will be established in photonics industry if the goals of this project are met successfully. At educational level, the research will be made accessible to undergraduate students especially from diverse backgrounds, who will get hands-on training toward advanced concepts in laser design and characterization, plasmonics, terahertz science, and cryogenic electrical and optical measurements.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Cryogenically cooled semiconductor quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) are the most powerful solid-state sources of coherent terahertz radiation; however, presently, single-mode terahertz lasers operating at practically viable temperatures could only radiate average optical power in the order of a milliwatt, which is insufficient for most targeted applications. This proposal seeks to improve power output from such QCLs by two-orders of magnitude in the range of hundred milliwatts with significantly improved beam quality. A portable electrically operated Stirling cryocooler will provide the required cooling for the semiconductor laser chips that could have tens of such phase-locked QCL arrays emitting at a range of discrete terahertz frequencies. Such a development could lead to commercialization of terahertz QCLs similar to the highly successful mid-infrared QCLs that have spawned recent economic activity in tens of companies worldwide. Terahertz QCLs utilize parallel-plate metallic cavities with strong mode confinement, for which a unique modal coupling scheme for multiple cavities through surface via the surrounding medium (vacuum or air) is proposed. Owing to the very long wavelengths at terahertz frequencies, it is shown that in-phase surface-plasmon-polariton modes for coupled cavities can be excited with periodic photonic structures fabricated using conventional lithography. Radiation in an ultra-narrow beam is expected owing to the spatially extended radiated wavefront of the phased-locked optical mode.<br/>Development of high-power terahertz lasers has the potential to enable commercial activity in terahertz spectroscopy, sensing, and imaging. Laser based terahertz instruments could lead to new insights in fields as diverse as cell-biology for study of biomolecular structure and dynamics, non-destructive evaluation and detection of drugs, pharmaceutical products, explosives, non-invasive imaging of biological samples, and remote-sensing of Earth's atmosphere and outer space. A successful outcome of this project will potentially lead to collaborations with industry (specifically, semiconductor laser companies), some of which have shown recent interest for development of terahertz instruments. At the University level, special efforts will be made to involve undergraduate students especially from diverse backgrounds in the research activities during each year."

This includes engines for light- and heavy-duty road vehicles (cars and trucks). Aggressive fuel economy and emissions targets have been established to simultaneously reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions, including greenhouse-gas emissions. At the same time, alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels (e.g., biofuels) are being introduced to reduce the carbon footprint of combustion-based energy systems. Predictive mathematical/computational tools are urgently needed so that engineers can optimize future engines and other combustion systems for maximum performance with minimum fuel consumption and emissions, while enabling the introduction of future sustainable fuels. These tools must include accurate representations of the key underlying physical processes. Radiative heat transfer is important in combustion systems, by virtue of their high temperatures, but has received relatively little attention to date because of its extreme complexity. This project will develop advanced radiation models that will be an important part of a new generation of predictive mathematical/computational tools, which in turn will enable the introduction of a new generation of high-efficiency, low-emissions, alternative-fuel vehicles.<br/><br/>High-resolution optical diagnostics and numerical simulations are increasingly being brought to bear to provide fundamental insight into the underlying physical processes in engines and other combustion systems, and to inform the development of reduced-order models that can be used for device and system design. However, the connection between experiment and numerical simulation/modeling remains somewhat primitive. For example, extensive simplification and modeling are required to provide quantitative values of temperature and equivalence-ratio distributions from measured radiative intensities for nonintrusive optical diagnostics techniques. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated models for spectral radiative heat transfer are being developed for computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based simulations of turbulent reacting flows, and these models provide an ideal starting point for directly computing the radiative intensity signals that correspond to various optical diagnostics techniques. By the end of this project, two important diagnostic techniques will have been developed/advanced for applications to harsh high-pressure combustion environments such as those in piston engines, simulation models will have been extended to directly compute radiative intensity signals corresponding to these diagnostic techniques, and a proof-of-concept of the advantages of making direct comparisons between computed and measured radiative intensities (versus derived quantities, such as temperature and equivalence ratio) will have been completed."

Murray and John von Neumann as a vast generalization of matrix algebra necessary to capture the mathematical complexities of quantum mechanics by encoding the symmetries of the quantum mechanical system in roughly the same way that matrix algebra encodes the symmetries of classical mechanics and general relativity. Over the intervening decades it has been realized that von Neumann algebras represent the symmetries of many objects studied in the physical and biological sciences, leading to applications in diverse fields such as the theory of statistical mechanics, the structure of DNA molecules, the theory of error correcting codes, and the theory of quantum information theory and quantum computing. The building blocks of these symmetries are called ""factors."" The main goal of the theory of von Neumann algebras is to provide an effective classification of factors to understand how symmetries arise in these various settings. One approach is through so-called rigidity, where it is shown that a small, known group of symmetries actually describes the entire, vast set of symmetries of a factor. Another direction addresses the computability of the symmetries of a factor via the ability to simulate the factor in a computer by matrix algebras, what is known as the Connes embedding problem.<br/><br/>The last decade has seen a rapid growth in the understanding of the structure of factors, due to the development of deformation-rigidity theory that was initiated by Sorin Popa in the early 2000s. These results and approaches have additionally had a remarkable impact on the fields of measurable dynamics of groups, descriptive set theory of Polish group actions, probability theory, as well as on geometric group theory and coarse geometry. Working to develop and expand this theory, the principal investigator's research focuses on the connections between operator algebras, geometric and measurable group theory, Lie groups, and ergodic theory, specifically through the use of geometric deformations that were first investigated in work by the principal investigator and Ionut Chifan. The principal investigator is also interested in the application of logic and model-theoretic techniques to operator algebras. The project aims to achieve the following broad objectives: (1) to continue developing a perspective from which tools from Lie groups and geometric group theory can be used to classify the structure of and to demonstrate new examples of rigidity phenomena in the context of group and measure-measure space von Neumann algebras; (2) to find applications of these techniques to measurable group theory, probability theory, and the classification of C*-algebras; (3) to further explore and develop connections between continuous model theory and von Neumann algebras, C*-algebras, and the theory of operator systems with applications to the Connes embedding problem. The principal investigator will continue to teach advanced courses and organize seminars in operator algebras, working closely with graduate students to develop and foster talent and discovery. He will also continue to broadly and actively disseminate his research through publications, seminar and colloquium talks, and conferences and workshops, at both the national and international level."

The intellectual merit of the work is to advance the scientific understanding of electrostatic charging in granular systems, both generally and specifically for the case of wind-blown dust.  Electrostatic charging of granular systems is ubiquitous and has important consequences in both industrial and natural processes, but is very poorly understood.  The impressive facilities at Lanzhou University, which include a wind-tunnel and a desert research station, offer a unique opportunity to carry out studies in a controlled but realistic environment and increase our understanding of particle charging in wind-blown systems. The broader impact of the program is to train US students in research with a global perspective; China is an ideal location for such a program, as the country has become a worldwide leader in industry, commerce and scientific research.  <br/><br/>The specific goals of the study will be to carry out measurements of particle fluxes, particle size distributions, and particle charge distributions as a function of elevation in wind-blown dust systems.  We will also measure electric fields as a function of elevation which will allow us to compare with previous studies, and correlate with particle flux, size and charging  On one hand, we aim to understand how these electrostatic effects vary with parameters such as wind speed, overall particle size distribution, and humidity, and on the other hand how the electrostatic effects arise in natural conditions and what their consequences may be on dust migration. Our strategy will be to: (a) develop and validate methodology in laboratory scale experiments; (b) carry out well-controlled large scale wind tunnel experiments, where wind speed and direction, as well as other relevant parameters (e.g., particle size distribution, humidity), can be controlled; and (c) carry out field experiments in the desert, where the conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity, etc.) are not controlled and will vary significantly during the course of the experimentation, but where the results are most meaningful in regard to environmental and climatic implications.  Students will work in interdisciplinary teams, serving in different roles throughout the project from designing experiments to carrying out field studies, and analyzing data."

Because of their low mass (thus, low gravitational binding energies), they are the most susceptible to any process that removes or prevents gas from condensing to form stars. However, because they are so dim, the only well-studied sample of faint dwarfs consists of those in the Local Group of Galaxies that includes our own Milky Way galaxy.  This project expects to answer some of the open questions about faint dwarf galaxies using deep imaging data: How abundant are they in the local Universe?  What is the relation between the mass of their stars and their halos of invisible ""dark matter""?  Which processes terminate star formation in faint dwarf galaxies?  The researchers will also leverage dwarf galaxy searches as a way to increase student access to STEM careers. They will develop a dwarf-galaxy-hunting project for gifted high-school students attending the Ohio Supercomputer Center's annual two-week Summer Institute, and increase access to the program including through scholarships to be funded via this project. The team will produce a ""This Is How We Science"" video blog (vlog).  This vlog will follow the researchers through the milestones and daily tasks associated with the project, and will also feature a how-to guide for young students interested in scientific careers.<br/><br/>The project will take a census of faint dwarf galaxies in the nearby Universe using existing deep, multi-wavelength Large Binocular Telescope imaging data from a ""failed supernova"" survey led by the Co-PI.  The 21 host galaxies span the range of galaxy types expected to host most of the faint dwarfs in the local Universe.  Analytic, semi-analytic, and numerical tools will be used to infer the relationship between the stellar masses of the faint dwarfs and their dark-matter halos, and to infer the faint dwarf number density in the local Universe. These models will also be used to investigate the relative strength of environmental, internal, and global quenching of star formation, as a function of host type and faint dwarf stellar mass."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar investigating risky behavior in adolescents, using interdisciplinary approaches drawn from neuroscience, cognitive science and developmental psychology. Adolescent risk-taking is a significant threat to public health, and contributes to a variety of adverse outcomes, including drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy and STIs, and violent crime. Two elements are known to contribute significantly to likelihood to engage in risk-taking: first, youth are more likely to take risks in the presence of peers, and second, risk-taking increases when youth are under the influence of alcohol. While alcohol consumption often takes place in a social setting, little research has considered how alcohol use and peer presence interact to influence adolescent decision-making. The present study uses a neurobiological framework to examine how the combination of peer presence and alcohol consumption affects brain responses during risk-taking tasks. Specifically, the project examines how peer presence and alcohol affect connections between brain areas known to be involved in risky decision-making. The project also examines how individual differences in brain responses relate to individual tendency to engage in risk-taking, give in to peer pressure, and abuse drugs and alcohol. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms underlying suboptimal decision-making in adolescence, and to identify potential neural or behavioral factors that predispose some youth to greater risk.<br/><br/>Adolescence is a time of considerable brain development, and a significant body of research suggests that two neural systems mature along different trajectories throughout this period. The differing developmental time courses of 1) cognitive control and 2) affective/reward processing are thought to contribute to adolescents' tendency to engage in risk-taking. The neural regions involved in these processes are well-characterized in the literature. However, much less is known about the way these regions interact during development, and how this interaction is affected by contextual factors that impact risk-taking. Previous research has identified two contextual factors that contribute significantly to adolescents? likelihood to engage in risky decision-making: first, adolescents are more likely to take risks in the presence of peers, and second, risk-taking increases when youth are under the influence of alcohol. While alcohol consumption in adolescence often takes place in a social setting, little research has considered how alcohol use and peer presence interact to influence decision-making. The present project addresses the limitations in the current literature by 1) utilizing fMRI analytic techniques that test models of interaction between multiple neural systems and 2) investigating the combined role of peer presence and alcohol intoxication on adolescent decision-making in a single experimental design. This project tests the hypothesis that peer presence and alcohol intoxication significantly diminish connectivity between cognitive control and affective processing regions during decision-making, thereby contributing to increased risk-taking. The project will also examine how neural responses relate to individual tendency to take risks and give in to peer pressure. In the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience, the predominant theories of adolescent decision-making posit a causal relationship between brain activity in multiple neural systems during risk-taking. However, the extant literature has relied on analytic approaches that are not designed to test causal interactions between brain regions. This project utilizes fMRI analytic approaches that test functional and effective connectivity between regions (Psychophysiological Interaction and Dynamic Causal Modeling), in order to directly investigate the way these regions interact and the direction of effects. Furthermore, this project will shed light on the combined role of peers and alcohol during risky decision-making, leading to a more sophisticated understanding of the way biological and sociocultural factors interact to produce outcomes in adolescence. The project and postdoctoral training require an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing analytic techniques from cognitive neuroscience, theories from developmental psychology, and experimental methods drawn from both clinical psychology and functional neuroimaging."

Lattice models, constructed to study natural phase transitions, are probability distributions on subsets of graphs depending on continuous parameters. This research project will study the phase transition of several important lattice models, including (1) the constrained percolation model, which randomly assigns ""0"" or ""1"" to each vertex of a graph, satisfying constraints that represent aspects of molecular structure; and (2) the self-avoiding walk, which is a path on a graph visiting each vertex at most once, introduced as a model for long-chain polymers. The work will broaden and deepen the mathematical foundations of the subject, with potential important applications in theoretical physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>The investigator aims to develop new theory concerning the phase transition of certain lattice models. Imposing constraints in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity, which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure. The connective constant and exponent of self-avoiding walks are fundamental properties of the underlying graph, yet can be identified for very few graphs. Another goal of this project is to obtain new information about connective constants and exponents for large classes of graphs, which may be achieved by analyzing harmonic functions on graphs. An analog to the central limit theorem in two dimensions is the limit shape behavior of height functions of certain lattice models at criticality, i.e. when the phase transition occurs. The investigator also plans to study the limit shape, using techniques from complex analysis and algebraic geometry."

However, one of their fundamental properties, the intrinsic limit of sensitivity, has not been fully understood. Specifically, at infrasonic frequencies (below 20 Hz), there has been no direct observation of the inherent noise in fiber-optic sensors, and the available theories remain inconclusive. The proposed project aims to address this problem by devising a set of experiments to probe the sensitivity-limiting noise in optical fibers and supporting the experimental study with advanced theoretical modeling. By uncovering the physics underlying the ultimate limit of sensor performance at low frequencies, the research will substantially deepen the understanding of infrasonic fiber-optic sensing, allowing future sensor designers to exploit the full potential of fiber-optic sensors at an unprecedented level of sensitivity. Moreover, the novel sensor designs used in the experiments will serve as blueprints for future ultra-sensitive distributed infrasound sensors, which are critical for monitoring mass-destruction weapons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, glacial motions, etc. The project will directly fund multiple students at both undergraduate and graduate levels and will generate capstone and summer research opportunities for college and high school students. It will also help create a new research thrust, precision fiber-optic sensing, at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and improve the presence of NSF in the state of Alabama.<br/><br/>Technical: The overarching goal of the planned research is to understand the physics that sets the ultimate limit of fiber sensor sensitivity at low frequencies. The investigation will primarily focus on direct measurement of the spontaneous thermal noise generated by optical fibers in the infrasonic region. A parallel effort will also be dedicated to the development of a three-dimensional visco-elastic model with concentric structures to describe the thermomechanical noise in optical fibers. To address the challenges facing the measurement of the minuscule thermal noise at infrasonic frequencies, a new sensor design based on a Mach-Zehnder-Fabry-Perot hybrid interferometer will be employed. Preliminary theoretical analysis has shown that such a scheme is able to raise the sensor sensitivity by a factor of 104, hence extending the thermal noise-dominated spectral region to well below 1 Hz. The scientific merit of the proposed research rests upon its primary goal toward uncovering the fundamental physical law of fiber thermal noise. The mystery surrounding the 1/f behavior of fiber thermal noise has puzzled researchers for two decades. There is an urgent need within the fiber-optic sensor community for a thorough investigation specifically targeting the low-frequency characteristics of thermal noise. By leveraging new sensing concepts such as hybrid interferometers, the proposed work will completely transform optical sensing for low-frequency signals and open up a new paradigm of infrasonic technologies."

It likely played a key role as languages evolved and it continues to play important roles in children's language acquisition and adult communication.  Group communication is typical of a variety of high-stakes settings, including classroom education and business teams, yet surprisingly little is known about what makes communication in groups successful. One determinant of success is the ability to appreciate the perspective of the other person or people in the conversation. Basic communicative exchanges such as asking a question require calculations about what other people know. For example, if you want to know the answer to a question such as ""Where is the gas meter?"" it is first necessary to determine who is likely to know the answer in order to ask the appropriate person (e.g., a plumber is likely to know, but a young child is not). Keeping track of who knows what also allows us to navigate social relationships effectively. For example, if you once tell your friend ""My son is getting married in June,"" it is usually communicating good news.  If you repeat the same information to the same friend several times, it may instead signal anxiety, uncertainty, or disbelief. This project examines how people take into account the knowledge and perspective of other people in communicative settings and examines conversations among groups of three or more individuals, each of whom brings a different set of beliefs and knowledge to the conversation. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will have opportunities to participate in laboratory research and high school students and elderly individuals from the community will be involved in laboratory activities through community outreach programs. The results of studies on conversation will not only advance understanding of psychological and linguistic processes but can also be used to advance computer dialog systems (such as Siri). <br/><br/>The proposed work uses methods established by the principal investigator to examine key open questions regarding language use in communicative settings. The idea is that conversational partners serve as contextual memory cues, supporting the partner-specificity of language use. This people-as-contexts (PAC) idea is used as a framework (1) to evaluate candidate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms supporting perspective-taking in multiparty conversation; (2) to test predictions concerning the binding of partners to language and generalization to new contexts; and (3) to examine how adaptation scales up to multiparty conversation. Predictions derived from the theory are tested in the domains of audience design and syntactic adaptation."

Not surprisingly, the issue of securing hardware has become increasingly vital. A reverse engineering adversary may, for example, be motivated by extracting intellectual property from a circuit, cloning a design for product piracy, or creating a targeted backdoor for stealing cryptographic keys. In many real-world settings, we have to assume a strong attacker who has full access to the IC and can analyze all hardware features therein. Numerous hardware attacks over the last few years have shown that reverse engineering is a surprisingly easy task. The goal of this project is to develop strong and quantifiable protection mechanisms for ICs. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project combines security engineering, formal verification and circuit design, with the aim of creating strong obfuscation techniques that thwart IC reverse engineering.

In this project, relative social infrastructure strength is grouped as follows: those researchers who are connected to a department of engineering education; those who are connected to a center or other non-department, formalized group on their campus; and those who have neither connection. Any combination of access types may be present on a single campus.

Through two phases of the research root cause analysis will be applied to the problems of faculty reward structures and diversity in engineering; working at the level of structural economic forces in higher education in the first case, and racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of structural inequality in the second case, will guide strategies and interventions to produce lasting, significant change and address problems at their source. This approach will further the research on change in engineering education by understanding faculty behavior as grounded not only in personal motivation and institutional reward structures but also in current economic and policy frameworks for higher education. The results of this project will identify mechanisms to strengthen engineering education networks. Of particular importance are those researchers currently working in the field who are not strongly connected to those networks. Broad-based and widespread change will occur through modifications to communities' infrastructure and leadership development that support both the engineering education researchers and practitioners."

Yet there is limited research testing this idea, particularly in engineering. This project is surveying thousands of students in engineering programs at a variety of different high schools and colleges to build an evidence base. The results are being used to understand how engineering identity and early engineering experiences predict persistence to graduation and persistence in the profession. This information is being used to better design and evaluate the impact of early engineering outreach and interventions. The variety of schools and students in this study is enabling examination of differences by gender and ethnicity, which is informing interventions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.

Identity is emerging as an attractive explanation for who persists in engineering, yet few studies have directly linked identity to persistence, nor thoroughly examined the host of factors that shape identity. This project is building on work on math and science identity, as well as research on the importance of professional experiences, to examine these issues. The study is unique in its examination of engineering identity across a range of educational stages, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and recent bachelor's-level engineering graduates. Through ongoing longitudinal work and a cross-sectional design using multivariate regression, this study is describing engineering identity trajectories from high school through graduate study or professional employment.

This capability enables realizing systems that utilize complementary strengths of humans and robots. Several new low-cost robots have been introduced in the market over the last few years, making them attractive in many new manufacturing applications. This makes the idea of hybrid cells economically viable for small and medium manufacturers, which represent a very important segment of the manufacturing sector in the United States. Both humans and robots can make errors in a hybrid cell, hence creating contingency situations. Unless handled promptly, a contingency situation may lead to significant operational inefficiencies. Hence, hybrid cells are not likely to cost-effective unless contingency situations are proactively detected and managed. This National Robotics Initiative (NRI) award supports fundamental research to enable proactive management of contingencies arising during human-robot collaboration in hybrid work cells in small production volume manufacturing operations. Results from this research will enable introduction of industrial robots in small production volume operations and are expected to make US manufacturing industry cost competitive in the global market. The integration of the research with graduate and undergraduate courses will enhance the robotics and manufacturing curricula and enrich learning experiences of the participating students. Outreach activities will educate and inform K-12 students about career opportunities in robotics and manufacturing.   <br/><br/>Fundamental advances are needed in automated planning, cell monitoring, replanning, and human-robot interaction to endow hybrid cells with effective contingency handling capabilities.

Algorithms will be developed for real-time monitoring of the task progress to ensure that tasks are completed in a safe and efficient manner. Real-time replanning algorithms will be designed to handle contingencies and refine plans based on the observed task execution performance. This research will also explore and characterize methods for effective information exchange between humans and robots to deal with contingencies."

Wagner is "" Investigating the effects of intensive breeding on maize-associated fungal and bacterial communities and their impact on crop productivity "" The host institutions for the fellowship are the North Carolina State University and Oregon State University and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Peter Balint Kurti, Dr. Posy Busby, and Dr. James Holland.<br/><br/>Bacteria and fungi living within leaves and roots can profoundly affect plant health, and are a potentially useful tool in sustainable agriculture. Plant genes partially control these microbial communities, letting certain microbes into the plant and keeping others out. It is unknown, however, whether genetic changes caused by intensive crop breeding have affected the composition of the microbiome. These experiments will expand our knowledge of the maize (corn) microbiome and improve our understanding of the links between plant genomes, plant-associated microbes, and crop productivity. The researcher will build her expertise in plant pathology, microbiology, and genomics while sharing results with agricultural researchers as well as public audiences at local schools and educational farms, and will enthusiastically recruit students of diverse backgrounds for participation in this project and mentorship in science career development.<br/><br/>Successful integration of microbial improvement techniques into sustainable agriculture requires a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between plant genomes and microbiomes. Moving beyond descriptive studies, this project uses existing germplasm from current maize breeding programs to test predictions about how various genetic perturbations might alter the microbiome. The effects of hybridization, intense artificial selection, and introgression of disease-resistance loci on microbial endophyte communities will be measured using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and culture-based methods. Greenhouse re-inoculation experiments will then test whether breeding-induced microbiome alterations feed back to affect plant vigor and pathogen resistance. Data will be shared publicly at the NCBI Short Read Archive and repositories such as Dryad, and maize endophyte cultures will be shared on request."

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Alyssa-Lois Madden Gehman is ""Past and present effects of multiple stressors on host-parasite interactions.""  The host institution for this fellowship is the University of British Columbia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christopher Harley.  <br/><br/>This project uses museum collections to address how environmental change fundamentally alters species interactions over several decades. Specifically, the Fellow is evaluating the effect of changing temperature and ocean acidification conditions on host-parasite interactions, using mussel-cyanobacteria interactions as a model system. Shell boring parasites, such as endolithic cyanobacteria, are unique in that they leave traces of their infection in preserved host shells. Mussels can be infected by shell boring parasites, and analysis of shell chemistry can estimate the ocean conditions at the time the mussels were alive. To accomplish the research goals, the Fellow is identifying endolithic cyanobacterial species and ichnospecies (a way of identifying the cyanobacteria parasite based on shell boring pattern), and measuring endolithic cyanobacterial growth and host defense using museum specimens from the Beaty Biodiversity Museum and the California Academy of Sciences. The Fellow is also conducting field sampling and experiments to confirm correlative patterns from collections.<br/><br/>In terms of training goals, the Fellow is gaining expertise in 1) paleontological methods of ichnospecies identification, 2) genetic techniques for identifying extant species, 3) stable isotope analysis, 4) biomechanical measurements and 5) conducting ocean acidification experiments. The Fellow is also integrating research with an outreach program that encourages community environmental awareness, leadership, diversity, self-confidence, and knowledge of the outdoors. To support this mission, the outreach program includes collaboration with a student-led outdoor education program associated with the public high schools in Seattle, WA. The Fellow is engaging students in hands-on field ecology, including the development of a coastal field trip during which the students aid with the field components of the Fellow's research.  An additional aspect of the outreach program includes communicating with local, national and international media, both through traditional radio and newspaper reporting and through more modern avenues such as blogs and podcasts."

At the same time, early reports indicate that many maker and hacker spaces are already enacting certain norms that are more conducive to participation of white, male, middle-class, able-bodied hobbyists. Despite this trend, there are spaces that explicitly stand out in their inclusion of homeless makers, women, people of color, and people with different kinds of abilities. This project examines how diverse maker spaces welcome groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, and how these practices can inform the design and operation of campus and community maker or hacker spaces that presently struggle to achieve diversity. <br/><br/>Ethnographic methods and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) are used to understand these spaces in terms of their physical and linguistic artifacts.  This Participatory Action Research (PAR) includes ethnographies at 6 to 8 inclusive maker and hacker spaces, an Open Space Technology (OST) workshop focused on identifying and analyzing core attributes of transferable inclusive practices, and CDA that reflexively summarizes and propagates this information in applicable ways to academic and community sites. Research questions include:  (1) What practices and artifacts do participants in diverse maker and hacker spaces employ to establish and maintain environments that are diverse and inclusive? (2) What does the discourse in diverse maker and hacker spaces reveal about how meaning and value are co-constructed around identity, creativity, and the culture of production / the production of culture in engineering? (3) What best practices emerge from diverse maker and hacker spaces, and how can these translate to design or transformation of existing maker spaces on campuses and in communities? Intellectual Merit: This work is early in its use of CDA, the Highlander strain of PAR, and OST, all novel in engineering education; and early in seeking to characterize features contributing to the liberatory nature of emergent diverse maker spaces. The work is interdisciplinary and potentially transformative in leveraging linguistic analysis and social theories to ferret out root causes of exclusionary STEM practices for the potential high payoff of building campus and community maker spaces (and other STEM spaces) that are inclusive. Broader Impacts: This project co-constructs ways to stimulate innovative design thinking in experiential curricula; increases retention and broadens participation in STEM by embedding inclusive practices; empowers citizen engineers through local and national networks of makers, students, and faculty; and enables new ways of STEM learning and design thinking that will enrich the U.S. innovation ecosystem through progressive learning environments for undergraduate engineers. Findings are propagated non-tradtionally via maker virtual communities, maker faires, and informal networks, in addition to traditional propagation through the STEM education literature and the network of 150 engineering deans and other academic leaders committed to making on campus."

This project is developing new approaches to a long-standing goal in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), namely, multinuclear MR images of hard and soft solids with high spatial resolution.  Conventional MRI detects only the signal from the Hydrogen in liquid water; MRI of solids is so much more difficult that it is rarely attempted. To perform high-resolution MR imaging of solids, this project uses the innovation of quadratic echo line-narrowing, which was recently discovered as a direct result of the NSF's investment in basic, curiosity-driven research.  Potential solid targets include porous rocks, composite materials, ""through-silicon vias"" in 3D integrated circuits, bone and soft tissues. Cutting-edge science with a broad range of potential applications enables excellent education and training of students from the early undergraduate level through the Ph.D., along with K-12 outreach efforts. While this project's plan of work is aimed at making fundamental scientific contributions, the work should find applications in other areas of science and technology, and there are potential societal benefits as well.  For example, applying an entirely new experimental tool to problems in granular physics, such as the properties of grain in silos, can advance theory and experiment in a field that is very important to industry.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The small difference between hard pi-pulses and their delta-function approximation can be used to generate new classes of spin echoes which have promising applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or microscopy of solids, and related spectroscopies. For example, using the quadratic echo line-narrowing pulse sequence, a novel tool for the control of spin coherence, this project is pursuing a new approach to carrying out MRI of solids with high spatial resolution.  This project has a strong focus on the education and training of students from the early undergraduate level through the Ph.D., along with K-12 outreach efforts. While the plan of work is aimed at making fundamental scientific contributions, there are potential societal benefits as well. First, advancing new forms of spin coherence control, applicable to a wide variety of spin (pseudospin, or qubit) Hamiltonians, is broadly useful in many areas of spectroscopy.  As part of this effort, we are working to extend the reach of quadratic echoes to an even wider range of nuclei (e.g., Carbon-13, Silicon-29) and experimental systems.  Second, finding ways to squeeze more information from less data, in an effort to accelerate the imaging of solids, has immediate benefits to the kind of NMR that is used for structure determination in biology and chemistry (including drug discovery).  This project's efforts to reconstruct high-quality MR images (or NMR spectra) from non-uniformly sampled data build upon Veit Elser's iterated maps approach, which is a form of compressed sensing well-suited for this application. Third, applying an entirely new experimental tool to problems in granular physics will advance theory and experiment in a field that is very important to industry. Historically, improvements in our ability to 'see' inside opaque solids have had broader impacts."

With an increasing number of backyard and community gardens, our society is already gradually transitioning to producing food within the city. But can urban agriculture be more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional farming? Are environmental impacts always greater than environmental benefits in agriculture? How can we use existing environmental impact and environmental benefit modeling approaches to estimate ?net and absolute sustainability? of agriculture? In this project, we will answer these types of questions in a collaborative effort from University of Toledo (UT), University of Utah (UU), and Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). Current local food movement will further strengthen and be guided by scientific understanding if our results show that urban agriculture has net environmental benefits.<br/><br/>This project aims to have impact in both research and global engagement. Students from all three institutions will train and collaborate virtually for two semesters prior to UT and UU students traveling to UAB for two months.

Students and principal investigators will model tomato production in rooftop greenhouses and community gardens in three cities: Toledo, Salt Lake City, and Barcelona. Life cycle assessment will be used to estimate environmental impacts. Ecosystem services models will be used to estimate environmental benefits. The impacts and benefits will be added to estimate ?absolute environmental sustainability? for agricultural systems. Multiple scales will be analyzed as we compare results at individual versus city wide implementation to derive conclusions for facility managers, utility managers, design engineers, and urban planners.

The results will help us understand how human population growth affects natural populations of wild species, and the complex interactions among people, domesticated animals, and the environment. The study will advance science through the development of new genomic methods and computational ""big data"" analyses (bioinformatics) for analyzing genomic data. These methods will initially be applied to a study of people, their cattle, and two endangered lemur species in Madagascar, which is an ideal site because humans first arrived to the island relatively recently (several thousand years ago). Research on human-environment interactions in other regions of the world, including North America where human-environment interaction started earlier, will also benefit from these methods. The educational component of the project will involve the annual delivery of bioinformatics training workshops to diverse audiences; participating students will develop biological and computer science skills that separately and together will have wide scientific and industrial training applicability.<br/><br/>The scientific aims of this proposal include reconstructing high-resolution demographic histories for Malagasy people, their commensal domesticated cattle, and two widely-distributed endemic lemur species, all with temporal resolution relevant to the recent timeline of human history on the island. These results, made possible by the application of novel population genomic methods developed by the principal investigator, will be compared to each other and to available paleoclimate data to develop an integrated empirical model of the history of anthropogenic effects on Madagascar's biodiversity. Madagascar is an important island for studying the processes and consequences of human-environment interaction. The people of Madagascar have an interesting history because of their relatively recent arrival to the island, their mixed Austronesian and African ancestry, and because of their relationship to one of the world's most biologically diverse, endemic and threatened ecologies. This work will empirically transform our understanding of the history of anthropogenic effects on Madagascar's biodiversity and establish an integrative research framework for application to other regions of the world where Holocene resource use intensification and human-environment interaction are likewise topics of major interest. A centerpiece of the educational component of this project is the annual delivery of interactive-style bioinformatics training workshops that build on the integration of biological and computational science that is central to the research. The most advanced workshop will be integrated with the project's scientific aims through ?hackathon?-style development of computational tools for analyses of the genomic data generated in this study.

Identity refers to how people see themselves, or the ""kind of person"" that they identify with. Logically speaking, if individuals strongly identify themselves with a particular field, they are more likely to pursue and remain in that field. Yet there is limited research testing this idea, particularly in engineering. This project is surveying thousands of students in engineering programs at a variety of different high schools and colleges to build an evidence base. The results are being used to understand how engineering identity and early engineering experiences predict persistence to graduation and persistence in the profession. This information is being used to better design and evaluate the impact of early engineering outreach and interventions. The variety of schools and students in this study is enabling examination of differences by gender and ethnicity, which is informing interventions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. The results are being disseminated widely to teachers, professors, administrators and others so that they can use the results to improve programs for engineering student recruitment and retention. <br/><br/>The investigators are employing survey scale development and multivariate regression modeling to examine the predictors of engineering identity and its impact on persistence at different educational stages. Identity is emerging as an attractive explanation for who persists in engineering, yet few studies have directly linked identity to persistence, nor thoroughly examined the host of factors that shape identity. This project is building on work on math and science identity, as well as research on the importance of professional experiences, to examine these issues. The study is unique in its examination of engineering identity across a range of educational stages, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and recent bachelor's-level engineering graduates. Through ongoing longitudinal work and a cross-sectional design using multivariate regression, this study is describing engineering identity trajectories from high school through graduate study or professional employment. Study sites include 100 high schools enrolling approximately 5000 students per year in engineering courses and engineering departments of mechanical, civil and biomedical engineering at five institutions enrolling a total of 5000 undergraduate and 2000 graduate engineering students. The results are providing an understanding of how engineering identity develops and how that identity impacts persistence."

These reconstructions will enable an assessment of this region's contribution to deglacial sea level rise, freshwater input to the ocean and possible impacts on its circulation, and how the ice sheet responded to the abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation -- all critical for testing computer models used to predict the future."

When three-dimensional spaces (manifolds) are glued together along their two-dimensional boundaries, the properties of the resulting space depend in complex ways on the properties of the gluing maps. The gluing maps themselves form a rich algebraic structure known as a mapping class group; this research project explores a number of settings where this structure comes into play. A particular role is played by a special geometric property of the mapping class group known as relative hyperbolicity, which has enabled the fine geometric structure of three-dimensional manifolds to be teased out and analyzed. Some of the previous advances in this area have yielded general statements but not concrete estimates, and in a number of areas the investigator expects to be able to sharpen current understanding and compute concrete bounds. The focus, nevertheless, is to deepen conceptual understanding of the way that two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds fit together. <br/><br/>The project investigates aspects of the interaction between topology of surfaces and three-manifolds, with connections to deformation spaces of geometric structures and geodesic flows in Teichmuller space. A common thread in the work is the hierarchical structure of mapping class groups and the phenomenon of relative hyperbolicity via curve complexes. In a project on fibered hyperbolic three-manifolds, the investigator will explore the ""subsurface profiles"" of the set of all fibrations, namely the pattern of projections to fiber subsurfaces of the stable and unstable foliations associated to the monodromy maps. The goal here is to obtain uniform (genus independent) descriptions and to relate them to the combinatorial structure of veering triangulations. In Teichmuller theory, the investigator will pursue a conjectural description of the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the moduli space of a surface, developing new tools with which to analyze the combinatorial patterns or itineraries of geodesic rays. The investigator will study the skinning map defined by Thurston on the Teichmuller space of the boundary of a hyperbolic three-manifold. He will work toward a better quantitative control of the diameter bounds known for such maps in the acylindrical case. In the general case he will extend previous work that established relative bounded image results, to complete the proof of a claim of Thurston on iterates of the skinning-and-gluing maps in the setting where a gluing yields an atoroidal manifold. This work will also connect to a project on establishing new uniform bi-Lipschitz models for hyperbolic three-manifolds."

Understanding the characteristics of the plates, such as the geometry of the descending plate (or slab), and the processes by which they slip past each other is key to assessing the extent of the seismic risk.  Parts or all of the two plates may be stuck together, accumulating strain that may be released in a large earthquake, or they may slide past each other more quietly, including in ""slow slip events"", where energy is released over days or years instead of seconds.<br/><br/>South central Alaska is an excellent laboratory for investigating links between slab and upper plate characteristics and slip behavior in subduction zones. The region generated the second-largest earthquake ever recorded (a magnitude 9.2 in 1964), but major questions remain about processes along this margin.  Earthquake activity shows that the Alaska-Aleutian slab is subducting beneath part of southern Alaska.  This earthquake activity stops abruptly to the east of where the magnitude 9.2 earthquake occurred, leading to speculation that the slab may not be continuous throughout the area.   Recent GPS studies have suggested that the slab is present and locked with the upper plate across much of the area and seismic investigations have found evidence that transient behavior may also occur, but sparse data has limited further work.<br/><br/>The project team, from Purdue University, is installing four new continuous GPS sites and five temporary GPS sites.  The team is combining data from these sites with data from existing sites to investigate subduction processes in the area, including understanding the geometries of the slab and upper plate and determining where, and to what degree, the plates are locked.  The team is also searching for subtle evidence of transient events; if found, those events can be related to plate geometries and plate locking.  <br/><br/>The project is also providing local K-12 teachers the opportunity to participate in fieldwork and learn about how GPS data is used in tectonic studies.  Lesson plans developed with these teachers incorporate this project's research into a larger scale view of the region's tectonics and give students experience working with scientific data.  The team is spreading its research results to a larger audience through interactions with National Park Service staff and public lectures.  Overall, this project is generating and communicating a more complete understanding of processes in the easternmost Alaska subduction zone, which will improve seismic hazard estimates.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This proposal seeks to improve understanding of the relationship between complicated slab geometries (e.g. flat slab subduction, edges or kinks in slabs) and subduction-related processes such as upper plate deformation, coupling along the subduction interface, and transient events (e.g. slow-slip).  Data from 4 new continuous GPS sites, 5 new campaign sites, and existing continuous and campaign sites in the region are being used to examine strain patterns, the geometry of the subducting slab, coupling along the subduction interface, upper plate motion, and transient processes along the easternmost Alaska subduction zone.  The project is addressing the following questions: 1) What is the geometry of the subduction interface? Where is the eastern edge of the active subduction interface? How does this relate to the Wrangell Volcanic field and observed seismicity? 2) How does coupling vary within the easternmost Alaska subduction zone? Where does the transition from locked to creeping occur? How does this relate to the observed tremor, upper plate deformation, and seismicity? 3) Are there transient events resembling slow-slip events on the subduction interface? How do these transient events relate to the interface geometry and coupling distribution?  The new data are allowing an assessment of plate boundary characteristics on a much more spatially and temporally dense scale than currently possible, leading to more detailed and realistic models of the behavior of the Yakutat slab interface and its influence of the region's tectonics."

This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.<br/><br/>The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity."

This is the first region of the cerebral cortex (the convoluted part of the brain responsible for higher cognitive function in primates) to receive and process visual information from the eyes. It can be viewed as a two-dimensional sheet of millions of brain cells (neurons) communicating with each other via electrical signals. The electrical activity patterns of these neurons encode information about a visual image, which is then processed by other regions of the brain, resulting in the visual perception of a dynamically changing three-dimensional world. Visual information is often represented by spatially structured or coherent activity patterns. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin the origin and maintenance of these dynamical patterns is not only important for understanding the normal functioning of the visual brain, but also the occurrence of pathological states during epileptic seizures and migraines. One of the major challenges in neuroscience is determining how the wiring of the visual brain contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns. The investigator has developed mathematical models of the primary visual cortex based on models that describe the generation and spread of electrical activity across the two-dimensional cortical sheet. Recent experimental studies indicate, however, that the laminar or layered structure of the primary visual cortex plays a crucial role in the production of these activity patterns. This research project, which is part of a larger collaborative program with the Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah, aims to extend previous mathematical models in order to take into account the laminar structure and determine how it affects a range of spontaneous visual phenomena. The main focus of the collaboration is to use a combination of neurophysiology, anatomy, and computational modeling to understand the functional architecture of the primary visual cortex and its role in visual processing. The Moran group is currently developing the use of light to control genetically modified cells and virus labeling techniques in order to understand the fine-structure of the visual cortex, which will be used to refine the mathematical models. The underlying idea linking the two projects is that the neural circuits used in the mathematical models to understand spontaneous activity are the same as those used to explain observations of the normal response of the cortex to visual stimulations. This project promotes scientific progress in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical neuroscience and vision and contributes to the interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The modeling of the primary visual cortex involves the construction and analysis of continuum neural field models, in which the large-scale dynamics of spatially structured networks of neurons is described in terms of nonlinear, integro-differential equations. A major advantage of working with neural fields is that powerful methods from the mathematical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations can be adapted to analyze such models. Almost all previous studies of neural fields have ignored the fact that the cerebral cortex has a laminar structure, with neurons in distinct layers often having distinct stimulus response properties and participating in distinct circuits. There is also extensive coupling between layers via so-called vertical connections. In this project the laminar neural field models will be used study two important examples of spontaneous visual phenomena, namely, binocular rivalry waves and visual hallucinations. One possible mechanism for the latter is based on the idea that some chemical or physical disturbance can destabilize the visual part of the brain, inducing a spontaneous pattern of cortical activity. The geometry of the resulting hallucination thus reflects the intrinsic architecture and symmetry of the visual cortex. Analyzing such patterns can provide further insight in how the brain processes images in normal vision. Binocular rivalry is the phenomenon where perception switches back and forth between different images presented to the two eyes. The resulting fluctuations in perceptual dominance and suppression provide a basis for non-invasive studies of the human visual system and the identification of possible neural mechanisms underlying conscious visual awareness."

There is a great deal of variation in the strength of the social infrastructure used by engineering education researchers to collaborate and build research projects of sufficient depth and diversity for true systemic change. In this project, relative social infrastructure strength is grouped as follows: those researchers who are connected to a department of engineering education; those who are connected to a center or other non-department, formalized group on their campus; and those who have neither connection. Any combination of access types may be present on a single campus. The purpose of this project is to discover and implement evidence-based social infrastructure elements that meet the needs of the third group while maintaining the integrity of the department- and center-based infrastructure. These researchers are often located in their universities in capacities that are highly intertwined with the practice of engineering education; finding better ways to network and support them creates stronger ties between research and practice, facilitating systemic and lasting change. <br/><br/>Using the social movement organizing methodology of relational meetings, the investigators will conduct a series of interviews with engineering education researchers who are connected with centers or departments those who are not, and their practitioner colleagues to identify areas of common concern, resources each can contribute to change agent networks, and opportunities for strategic intervention around which the engineering education change movement can build power. Through two phases of the research root cause analysis will be applied to the problems of faculty reward structures and diversity in engineering; working at the level of structural economic forces in higher education in the first case, and racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of structural inequality in the second case, will guide strategies and interventions to produce lasting, significant change and address problems at their source. This approach will further the research on change in engineering education by understanding faculty behavior as grounded not only in personal motivation and institutional reward structures but also in current economic and policy frameworks for higher education. The results of this project will identify mechanisms to strengthen engineering education networks. Of particular importance are those researchers currently working in the field who are not strongly connected to those networks. Broad-based and widespread change will occur through modifications to communities' infrastructure and leadership development that support both the engineering education researchers and practitioners."

Although these graphs are not<br/>planar (a road can cross a bridge without intersecting the road beneath), such crossings are<br/>uncommon, and the project will investigate ways of exploiting that<br/>sparse crossing structure to efficiently solve problems such as route<br/>planning on road networks. Similarly, the project will investigate the<br/>structure of the underlying geometric graphs, and the use of that<br/>structure to develop efficient algorithms, for other problems that<br/>include the visualization of hierarchically clustered networks,<br/>pattern mining in social networks, splitting large scientific<br/>simulations into smaller subproblems with low amounts of interaction<br/>between the subproblems, the analysis of mechanical systems of rigid<br/>parts connected by hinges, the design of maps that distort geographic<br/>areas to display other types of quantitative information, and the<br/>visualization of overlaps between fragments of DNA sequences.<br/><br/><br/>The project proposes attacks on a large collection of problems from<br/>application areas where sparse geometric graphs naturally arise. The<br/>project suggests a model for real-world road networks in which a<br/>derived graph of edges and their crossings has bounded degeneracy, and<br/>seeks to investigate how sparsity properties of this crossing graph<br/>affect the underlying road graph. The project seeks to determine<br/>whether it is hard to recognize the graphs of 4-polytopes and simple<br/>4-polytopes, and whether a recognition algorithm of the investigator<br/>for a special class of 4-polytopes can be extended to a realization<br/>algorithm. The graphs in this class have small separators, and the<br/>project seeks to determine whether this is true more generally for<br/>certain graphs derived from planar clustered graph drawings. The<br/>project seeks efficient data structures that maintain low-degeneracy<br/>orientations of a dynamic graph and use these orientations to quickly<br/>find features in the graph, needed when fitting social networks to<br/>exponential random graph models. Finite element meshes with bounded<br/>aspect ratio for each element have small separators, but arbitrary<br/>tetrahedral meshes do not. The project seeks intermediate conditions<br/>on the shape of the elements in a mesh that would ensure the existence<br/>of small separators. The graphs arising in kinematic analysis can be<br/>characterized by linear bounds on the edges in each subgraph, and<br/>recognized in quadratic time by a pebbling algorithm. The project<br/>seeks more efficient algorithms to test the rigidity or degrees of<br/>freedom of mechanical structures in subquadratic time. Subdivisions of<br/>rectangles into smaller rectangles have applications in architectural<br/>design, cartographic information visualization, and VLSI design. An<br/>area-universal subdivision is one that can fit any assignment of areas<br/>to its rectangles. The project seeks efficient algorithms to construct<br/>area-universal subdivisions as well as subdivisions produced by a<br/>recursive splitting process. Unit interval graphs arise in modeling<br/>human preferences and in DNA physical mapping. Some problems that are<br/>hard on broader graph classes can be solved efficiently on unit<br/>interval graphs by representing the graph using a binary sequence and<br/>applying a finite automaton to the sequence. The project seeks a more<br/>general explanation of this phenomenon. In graph drawing, styles of<br/>graph drawing on the basis that are somewhere-dense allow all graphs<br/>to be drawn in that style with constant bends per edge while nowhere<br/>dense styles require an unbounded number of bends per edge.

As water flows through river networks, the materials it carries are transported, stored, processed, and released in response to changing physical, chemical and biological characteristics.  The goal of this project is to better understand how river systems process carbon, retain nutrients, influence ecosystem health globally, and ultimately support healthy ecosystems, both in the rivers and the water bodies into which they drain.  One of the concepts upon which river ecosystem science is founded is that rivers change their characteristics and processing rates with size and/or distance downstream.  This idea, called the River Continuum Concept (RCC), has helped organize decades of river research and management.  However, while the RCC has been a useful conceptual model, it remains relatively poorly tested, which seriously limits the ability of scientists to predict how river functions will respond to ongoing and future changes on Earth. This work seeks to fill that important knowledge gap about how rivers function, and thus has implications for how humans manage land and water resources.<br/><br/>One constraint to providing information about river function along the river continuum has been technological; we simply have not had the tools to measure these functions along river networks.  A second constraint has been that the simple conceptual model of the RCC neglects key features of rivers, specifically that they are frequently impacted by discontinuities like dams and lakes, tributary confluences, and geologic divides.  This project alleviates both constraints by coupling state-of-the-art water quality sensor technologies to new sampling methods in carefully selected river sites.  Together, these advances are expected to provide new insights about the river continuum, the role of discontinuities in changing river functions, and ultimately about how to best manage and protect aquatic resources."

These reconstructions will enable an assessment of this region's contribution to deglacial sea level rise, freshwater input to the ocean and possible impacts on its circulation, and how the ice sheet responded to the abrupt climate changes of the last deglaciation -- all critical for testing computer models used to predict the future."

While a system of interest is often relatively simple, the environment it interacts with is often complicated and requires a judicious choice of a mathematical model. A model must be rich enough to capture essential features of the underlying phenomena; at the same time, the model needs to be mathematically tractable. In some of the models under investigation, the environment manifests itself as static disorder. This is in particular the case in models of activated carbon. One of the challenges in this particular investigation is to understand appearance of graphene sheets in activated carbon production. Graphene, a material that consists of just one layer of carbon atoms forming two-dimensional sheets, demonstrates a plethora of remarkable properties just beginning to be employed in engineering. This work, which has both theoretical and strong applied potential, will be done in collaboration with scientists working in industry. The long-term goal is to understand statistical mechanics in the presence of noise and disorder, which will enable study of more complicated systems relevant for applications in life sciences. The project will involve training of students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>In the majority of systems under study in this project, interaction with the environment takes the form of noise, modeled as a random perturbation, varying in time. Both classical and quantum systems will be modeled this way. In the case of classical systems, the project studies the qualitative impact of noise in systems with magnetic and time-dependent forces and, more generally, bifurcations resulting from the presence of noise. Of particular interest are also systems of large number of interacting particles. Previous work on one such system has possible applications for design of systems of task-performing micro-robots; that research will be continued in the present project. The theory of open quantum systems is much less developed; in this context the project investigates simple quantum optical systems, as well as the basic phenomenon of quantum Brownian motion. Particularly interesting physically is the case in which the strength of the interaction of the Brownian particle with the environment depends on its position. Mathematical models of this situation are not well understood and the project aims to improve the existing theory. More involved systems will also be studied, especially in the limit of small particle masses. The research on diffusive and open systems will be done in close collaboration with physics groups, both experimental and theoretical."

To achieve the first objective, a novel smart lipid macromer with highly reactive printable groups and functional segments will be synthesized and 4D bioprinted into smart constructs. Three printing parameters will be varied as follows: laser power from 5000 to 10000 Hz, printing speed from 1000 to 3000 mm/min, and printing distance from 1 to 3 mm. The microstructure of the bioprinted constructs will be observed via scanning electron microscopy, the tensile strength of the constructs will be measured using a uniaxial mechanical tester, and the shape memory effects of the constructs will be determined with shape memory tests. To achieve the second objective, the bioprinted constructs will be fixed at a temporary shape and restore their original shape with varied recovery process and recovery speed. Neural stem cell viability in the 4D bioprinted constructs will be quantified using a live/dead viability assay; neural stem cell growth, axonal extension, and differentiation will be measured via a cell proliferation assay and immunocytochemistry staining."

The project aims to develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of physically-relevant random fields.  It is anticipated that these tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems in the theory of SPDE and related random fields, and further promote their applicability.

In past work, the investigators developed ideas, based in geometric-measure theory, for the analysis of non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, and they introduced renewal-theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of nonlinear SPDE. This research project continues investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory, SPDE, and the geometry of random fractals. Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDE that are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise.  Further pursuit of these connections is expected to yield novel insights into the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related SPDE."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Shane Campbell-Staton is ""Exploring the genetic basis of high altitude adaptation in deer mice."" The host institutions for this fellowship are the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana and the University of Montana, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Julian Catchen (UI) and Zachary Cheviron (UM). <br/><br/>The Fellow's research addresses a major goal of evolutionary biology, to identify the genes that allow organisms to adapt to their environment and understand how these genes function to accomplish this feat. In this project, the Fellow is using the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, as a model species for studying adaptation to high altitude. Identifying the genetic basis of complex traits has proven challenging, partly because complex traits are often the result of interactions of many physiological and molecular pathways. Studying the genetic basis of physiological adaptation to high altitude offers unique advantages for disentangling the complex genetic interactions that produce adaptation because the specific steps involved in oxygen transport and use have been described. Deer mice are an excellent model species because they are distributed from sea level to above 4300 meters elevation in western North America. They display a suite of physiological adaptations of the heart, lungs, blood and skeletal muscle that work together, allowing high elevation populations to survive the cold temperatures and low oxygen levels characteristic of their environments, by transporting and using greater amounts of oxygen than their lowland counterparts. The Fellow is interbreeding highland and lowland deer mice populations and conducting a series of experiments to (1) identify the genes that contribute to differences in oxygen use; (2) partition those genes into the different steps that contribute to overall oxygen use (respiration, oxygen transport and metabolism in the muscle) and (3) identify the mechanisms by which those genes influence total oxygen use. This research will provide valuable insights into the genetic basis complex traits and serve as a model of animal adaptation to high elevation.<br/><br/>This Fellow is helping to broaden the participation of groups under-represented in biology in several ways. The Fellow is a member of an under-represented community and is mentoring and training future scientists from underrepresented backgrounds, and is teaching and disseminating research findings to students and the general public. The tremendous diversity of expertise among collaborators at the University of Illinois and the University of Montana provides a rich intellectual community for idea sharing that strengthens the outcomes of this project and advances the Fellow?s development as a scientist. Learning the analytical tools needed to complete the major goals of this proposal will allow the Fellow to develop an interdisciplinary approach to evolutionary biology. Through this fellowship, the Fellow is recruiting students from underrepresented groups through established channels at both host universities, and mentoring these student researchers. Additionally, he is expanding his experience in outreach programs geared towards recruitment of students from under-represented backgrounds at national and university levels. All of these activities are enhancing and expanding the Fellow?s ?toolbox? of analytical, managerial and mentoring skills, which will position him to become an emerging leader in the study of climate-mediated evolution, and to continue developing programs that will broaden participation of minorities in the sciences."

As the key building blocks of current and future computing systems?including the Internet of Things, many-core chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are facing unprecedented power challenges brought on by limits in Dennard scaling. This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication. Among some of the specific lines of research that are explored are alternative topologies and coordinated routing algorithms to enable more efficient power-gating of NoC routers, holistic approaches for exploiting coordination between the NoC and other on-chip system components as well as factoring in key application characteristics, and novel packet-oriented dynamic power control schemes that explore energy-saving opportunities beyond the conventionally targeted low-load traffic region. Beyond its technical contributions that can impact fundamental advancement in dark silicon computing, this research also has impact more broadly on research education and outreach. Findings from this research are incorporated into graduate curriculum, courses, and undergraduate research experiences. Outreach activities to broaden participation in computing of persons from diverse backgrounds and development levels are also featured."

Often, external electrostatic or magnetic fields are used to guide particles into positions where they can interact and form structures. This work studies fields that have not been widely appreciated or used in the past.  Particles on fluid interfaces deform and increase the area of the interface around them. The product of surface tension and this area increase is an energy field that depends on the curvature of the fluid interface, so particles move along curvature gradients.  Through this simple but remarkable fact, the geometry of the interface itself can be used to direct assembly.  Here, these fields are studied to identify new ways to form structures difficult to form by conventional means to make new materials whose properties are explored. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the course of performing the proposed research, including students in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, the Advancing Women in Engineering Program and the UPENN MRSEC REU program. New knowledge developed will be incorporated in a graduate course on interfacial phenomena.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This research seeks to establish new strategies for directed assembly of micron and sub-micron scale particles to go well beyond the usual close packed assemblies.  Particle trapped at fluid interfaces interact and migrate along interface curvature gradients via capillarity.  These energies drive formation of complex structures strongly correlated with the interface curvature field, influenced by particle-particle interactions. Since soft matter is inherently deformable, such interactions are a natural route to form reconfigurable, tunable assemblies. Different classes of structures are studied using optical microscopy to observe structures, lithographically defined vessels to mold fluid interfaces and magnetic and other probes to perturb the structures and to guide their reconfiguration. Kinetically trapped structures are studied to form colloidal monolayer membranes with voids, dense regions and oriented structures which respond to changes in interface shape. Equilibrated structures are studied to form structures aligned along principle axes of the interfaces and to study their reconfiguration upon interface perturbation.  The (dynamics of) structure formation is observed by optical microscopy for particle shapes and sizes selected for the scale of capillary interactions that they excite and their ability to form oriented structures with associated anisotropies in the structural response to perturbation. For both limits, particle positions/ orientations are compared to and correlated with the interface curvature.  Observations are compared to appropriate prediction based on, for example, Stokesian Dynamics simulations for trapped structures and Monte Carlo simulations for equilibrated structures."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

However, software errors are common, routinely cause security breaches, and cost our economy billions of dollars annually. Despite the well-known high costs of software errors, the software industry struggles to overcome this challenge, as new errors are reported faster than they can be fixed. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of automated program repair techniques to address this challenge.   In this research, we develop new techniques to fix software errors and implement new features automatically. The challenge is to fix code while not breaking other functionality, and to work toward repairing code of increasing complexity.<br/><br/>The approach takes advantage of the high availability of open-source code that already implements many functions required for a new software project. The approach is to search for relevant code in open-source projects, adapt that code to its new context using automated software repair and generation techniques, and then validate the changed software. A key component of the approach is semantic code search, which queries large databases of code to find code snippets that satisfy a behavioral specification. The project develops novel techniques that (1) encode large, searchable bodies of code as behavioral profiles, (2) localize bugs and features to code blocks, modules, and components, (3) extract the desired behavioral profiles of those blocks, modules, and components, (4) use the extracted profiles to search the database for potential patches, (5) adapt the potential patches to fit into the code context, and (6) validate the potential patches. The project focuses on producing high-quality code, verifying that the injected code does not break existing functionality.  The broader impacts come mainly from goal of radically improving software productivity through reuse and adaptation of existing code."

For example, stellar burning is responsible for the production of elements up to iron, and neutron capture processes create most of the heavy elements. However, the origin of heavy, proton-rich nuclei above iron is one of the greatest puzzles of stellar nucleosynthesis. The most likely scenario for creating these isotopes is the p-process: a complex network of photodisintegration reactions and their inverse (proton-, alpha- and neutron-capture) that occur during the explosion of a supernova. A vast network of 20,000 nuclear reactions for the p-process relies on models to provide input of nuclear properties and reaction rates for all the nuclei involved in the network. The goal of this project is to identify the reactions that are key for the p-process and to measure them directly, so as to minimize the uncertainty for those rates and provide constraints for the model predictions. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to understanding of the stellar p-process by measuring cross sections for proton and alpha capture reactions of relevance for Pd-102, Cd-108, Cd-110, Te-120 and Te-122. Those reactions have not been measured before, and have been identified as key for the p-process by two independent sensitivity studies. Studies have shown that the variations of those rates within the current model uncertainties have a significant impact on the production of the p-nuclei. The project will utilize a newly purchased detector (HECTOR) to employ the &#947;-summing technique. The impact of the measured reaction rates on the final abundances of the p-nuclei will be verified using network calculations whose results will be compared with the solar abundances. Additionally, the measured cross sections will be compared with model predictions and will be used to identify the model inputs that best reproduce the data."

Simple algebraic transformations already exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes. These universal patterns may be revealed through the rigorous study of so-called moduli spaces, their compactifications, and their stratifications by dynamical invariants. This research project appeals to a broad range of mathematical disciplines to both deepen our understanding of dynamical systems and to sharpen our mathematical and computational methods. Its methods have already led to the discovery of new and unexpected algebraic regimes, through a combination of theoretical tools that narrow the domain of search, and experimental methods such as the simulation of billiard flows in idealized polygons. <br/><br/>Moduli spaces of lattices, Riemann surfaces, rational maps and other algebraic structures exhibit rich geometry, often accompanied by rigidity and a connection with arithmetic. These spaces also have a dynamical nature -- they support natural flows or group actions with complicated orbits, or they classify such actions. This research project investigates moduli spaces from a dynamical and geometric perspective. In the setting of Riemann surfaces, the project aims to reveal the mechanisms within dynamics, algebraic geometry, and number theory that underlie the existence of unexpected, recently-discovered primitive, totally geodesic complex surfaces in moduli space. The investigator also aims to develop the L^p geometry of Teichmueller space, to interpolate between and go beyond the Teichmueller and Weil-Petersson metrics (which represent the cases p=1 and p=2). The case p=infinity in particular should lead to the sharpest bounds on the hyperbolic 3-manifold that fiber over the circle. In the setting of homogeneous spaces, the investigator plans to establish Ratner-like rigidity theorems for suitable open hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Additionally, in the setting of proper holomorphic maps on the unit disk, the investigator aims to develop a dynamical analogue of the theory of simple closed curves and stretch maps, enhancing the dictionary between rational maps and Kleinian groups."

This is a central area of mathematics with a vast range of applications, a small sampling of which includes physics, cryptography, and computational complexity (the design of faster, more efficient computational algorithms). A powerful tool in the subject is Hodge theory, which associates a linear algebraic structure to a set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations. The advantage of this association is that the Hodge structure is often more amenable to computation and analysis than the original set of solutions, while at the same time retaining enough information to yield deep insights into the set of solutions (and the questions that one would like to answer about them). The principal objective of this research project is to develop Hodge theory so that it can be applied to a greater range of problems in algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>The project will address a collection of problems in complex geometry and Lie theory that are motivated by Hodge theory. In practice this means that many of the questions concern (generalized) flag manifolds and flag domains, a canonical system of geometric partial differential equations on these spaces (whose integrals are called horizontal submanifolds), and locally homogeneous spaces. In Hodge theory, flag domains arise as period domains, the classifying spaces for polarized Hodge structures; flag manifolds as compact duals of period domains; the canonical system of geometric PDE as the infinitesimal period relation, Griffiths' system of differential equations constraining variations of Hodge structure. The work will include: (1) a generalization of the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification and Borel's extension theorem for locally Hermitian symmetric spaces to a class of locally homogeneous spaces of Hodge theoretic interest; (2) investigation of a conjectural mixed Hodge structure on the characteristic cohomology of the infinitesimal period relation; and (3) initiation of a program to study the extent to which a variation of Hodge structure is determined by its characteristic varieties."

Experiments will be carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Geneva, Switzerland.  In order to look for signatures of how the transition to the QGP phase has occurred for a given beam energy, the Ohio State group will study the numbers of particles produced in the collisions along with the distribution and correlations of particle momenta. <br/><br/>The goals for the high-energy program are three-fold. Firstly, to study the space-time properties of this extremely dense matter created in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. The second is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between quarks and gluons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, the group will perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, they will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to proton- proton collisions at similar energies. They will look particularly for collective behavior (flow) in these collisions. If the initial reports of such flow in high-energy p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself.   In addition, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing."

Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils.

Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org."

Understanding why animal signals are so complex and how they evolved is a major research focus for scientists in many fields. Such research can add to our knowledge about how the senses work, how attention and learning shift perception, and how changing environments can impact communication (among others). In this project, scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Auburn University use a systems approach to study the evolution of courtship displays in a well-developed animal system. The team uses genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of more than 23 species. For each species, they also describe the communication system in detail and how it changes with environmental conditions. They then test hypotheses about system properties such as robustness and flexibility/evolvability. The project will advance our understanding of complex animal signals, and test long-standing theories from engineering and genomics about system structure and function. The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students. Research findings will also be integrated into a science exhibit that will be made available to the general public at natural history museums in Nebraska and Alabama. <br/><br/>Despite an appreciation of the prevalence and importance of complex signals in animal communication, progress towards an evolutionary analysis of signal complexity has been constrained by a lack of hypotheses and tools that can compare signaling systems across taxa and assess evolutionary and functional implications. This project develops and tests a novel theoretical and empirical paradigm by integrating a systems approach into animal communication research using Schizocosa wolf spiders. North American Schizocosa include 23 species that vary in their use of vibratory and visual courtship displays. Specific aims are (1) to assess the structure and dynamics of vibratory and visual courtship signals of each species in different environments; (2) to generate a robust phylogeny; and (3) to use phylogenetic comparative methods to test (i) the hypothesis that degeneracy facilitates robustness across changing conditions and (ii) whether degeneracy facilitates (or constrains) elaboration and signal divergence. The simultaneous measures of vibratory and visual signals across contexts combined with a robust phylogeny will enable unparalleled opportunities for evolutionary analyses of complexity. This research will facilitate an integrative and comprehensive understanding of the evolution, diversification, and maintenance of complex animal communication and provide a roadmap for similar studies across distinct taxa and signaling systems."

This research effort will comprehensively investigate the effect of mechanical forces via strain as degrees of freedom for probing several phenomena experimentally including changes in its crystal structure, absorption and emission of light, and transition from a semiconducting to a metallic behavior, all of which, can be utilized to enable novel optoelectronic devices and chips. In light of the recent progress on growing crystals of black phosphorus, this research effort on the strong coupling of mechanical forces on its unique electrical and optical properties can result in breakthrough device applications at practical scales. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will be trained in conducting research at the frontier of nanomaterials and electronics.<br/>Technical:<br/>Phosphorene is poised to be the most attractive two-dimensional material owing to its high charge mobilities approaching that of graphene, and its thickness tunable bandgap that can be as large as that of semiconducting transitional metal di-chalcogenides. In essence, phosphorene represents the much sought after high-mobility, tunable direct bandgap atomically layered crystal that is ideal for nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and flexible electronics. In addition, the unique puckered lattice affords in-plane anisotropy that is absent in graphene, leading to strong coupling of mechanical forces with electrons, photons, and phonons that can enable advanced straintronics for efficient nanoscale energy conversion devices and transformational flexible technology. The proposed effort will focus on the strong coupling of mechanical forces on engineering the unique electrical and optical properties of phosphorene that can result in breakthrough device applications. The research effort will consist of two experimental approaches, investigation of the effects of uniaxial strain on the optoelectronic properties, and studies on hydrostatic pressure in triggering structural and electronic phase transitions."

Many new materials are predicted to have exciting electronic properties, but have never been made. Efforts to fabricate materials in specific structures generally use trial-and-error, low-throughput processes that inhibit the discovery, development, and ultimate deployment of materials in technology. In this project, a novel high-throughput structure-directing fabrication method is being explored to make a short list of breakthrough materials expected to impact energy and information technologies. Specifically, thin layers of a material are deposited simultaneously on hundreds to thousands of novel surfaces, and the structural relationships between the thin layers and all surfaces are efficiently determined. The structure-directing surfaces are tailored to favor specific target materials. Using this method, the research team is establishing the scientific underpinnings of materials stability, discovering new materials, and accelerating the development cycle of electronic materials. The investigators are incorporating research outcomes in undergraduate and graduate courses and developing technology enhanced learning tools for delivery of primary content and practice of essential skills. Specifically, a web/app interface is being developed to replace the traditional passive textbook experience with an interactive learning environment moving at the student's pace.<br/><br/>Technical Description: A high-throughput epitaxial film growth methodology is being used to produce entirely new electronic materials - previously unrealized, metastable complex oxides. The method is called combinatorial substrate epitaxy, and investigators are using this to study local epitaxial growth on hundreds to thousands of different kinds of surfaces. The research team prepares their own novel substrates as polished surfaces of sintered ceramics and specifically tailor them to support the fabrication of new materials predicted to exhibit exciting electronic properties. Electron backscatter diffraction is used as a high-throughput local structural probe and pulsed laser deposition as a material flexible film growth method. By exploring rapidly large regions of epitaxial synthesis space, the preferred epitaxial orientations between film-substrate structural pairs are determined and comprehensive epitaxial stability maps that plot phase as a function of processing conditions are established. The research team thus identifies the substrates and growth conditions that allow one to synthesize epitaxially a given composition in a specific crystal structure. The project is establishing the empirical scientific underpinnings of epitaxial stabilization, which enables the accelerated discovery of materials and their deployment in technologies. The investigators target the discovery of several specific breakthrough compounds expected to be exciting electrodes, ferroelectrics, and multiferroics."

The project will contribute to spatial demographic theory by focusing on the links between declines at various spatial scales and demographic characteristics.  Project methods and results will be generalizable to other countries experiencing regional population loss and will be useful for researchers in related fields who require up-to-date understanding of the evolving distribution and composition of the U.S. population.  Products from this project will be communicated to scholarly audiences in geography and population studies as well as to policy makers and directly to the public.  The project also will contribute to the professional education, training, and development of a post-doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Population loss is longstanding and widespread in the United States and will become more relevant if population growth slows.  Population loss affects places and people, although past research has tended to focus mostly on impacted places.

The investigator will develop new measures of place-specific population change that incorporate spatial context and temporal scale. The resulting typology of population change will identify various types of declining and growing places according to recent population change, the growth trajectory of neighboring areas, and population change in previous decades.  She will identify the demographic sources of population decline (such as fertility, mortality, and migration) associated with each category of population change and investigate variations in migrant characteristics and destinations by decline type.  She will evaluate the demographic burden of decline (such as differences in the characteristics of those exposed to population decline), with special focus on the characteristics of those living in areas declining at multiple spatial scales, and she will assess the dynamics of decline in order to discover how age structure, residential segregation, population composition and distribution, and poverty levels change when places lose population."

However, software errors are common, routinely cause security breaches, and cost our economy billions of dollars annually. Despite the well-known high costs of software errors, the software industry struggles to overcome this challenge, as new errors are reported faster than they can be fixed. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of automated program repair techniques to address this challenge.   In this research, we develop new techniques to fix software errors and implement new features automatically. The challenge is to fix code while not breaking other functionality, and to work toward repairing code of increasing complexity.<br/><br/>The approach takes advantage of the high availability of open-source code that already implements many functions required for a new software project. The approach is to search for relevant code in open-source projects, adapt that code to its new context using automated software repair and generation techniques, and then validate the changed software. A key component of the approach is semantic code search, which queries large databases of code to find code snippets that satisfy a behavioral specification. The project develops novel techniques that (1) encode large, searchable bodies of code as behavioral profiles, (2) localize bugs and features to code blocks, modules, and components, (3) extract the desired behavioral profiles of those blocks, modules, and components, (4) use the extracted profiles to search the database for potential patches, (5) adapt the potential patches to fit into the code context, and (6) validate the potential patches. The project focuses on producing high-quality code, verifying that the injected code does not break existing functionality.  The broader impacts come mainly from goal of radically improving software productivity through reuse and adaptation of existing code."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records.

LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses.

The goal is to also engage industry and educators in developing a talent pipeline and initial curriculum addressing the material properties as well as optimization and manufacturing processes associated with lightweight materials at the high school and community college levels to meet emerging industry needs for technicians in the manufacturing industry. A central element of this proposal entails the introduction of a new arrangement of course design and delivery. With the advent of lightweight materials and manufacturing processes, the manufacturing industry is shifting to a systems approach rather than the traditional silo manufacturing practices. WCC will utilize this project to create a model for community college curriculum development utilizing this systems approach. The overview course will be multidisciplinary, project-based and designed around specific lightweight materials or categories of materials (aluminum alloys, plastics and polymers, carbon fiber composites, etc.) rather than focused on specific manufacturing disciplines. For each material or group of materials, the course will be arranged so that an overview of the material properties, applications, design for manufacturability, and manufacturing processes will be presented. As an introductory course, this will facilitate students identifying specific areas of interest in which to continue their studies. It will also provide a broader context for these students to build a systems approach into their study of advanced manufacturing or advanced transportation.  A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to continuously enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and evaluating the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices."

But we do not understand what really controls the color, the stability, and synthesis yield of these wonderful nanomaterials. The project seeks to answer these fundamental questions, with the end goal to engineer and harness silver clusters for a diversity of biological sensing and imaging applications. Undergraduate and high school students at Furman characterize the chromophores and the graduate students at UT-Austin at the same time develop their sensing applications. The collaboration and feedback between the two groups are the linchpin that drives the development of new nanosensors. Furthermore, the PIs outreach to local high schools to integrate a larger group of interested and talented students. These research activities will inspire a diverse group of curious students to share in the excitement of scientific innovation.<br/><br/>Future progress in fluorescence detection and imaging is hampered by the scarcity of functional probes. Professors Yeh and Petty are developing a novel class of switchable and tunable silver clusters that are conjugated with DNA strands. They are addressing core factors that control the chemical stabilities, biocompatibilities, and optical properties of silver clusters using a wealth of purification and analysis techniques such as HPLC, SEC, CD, MS, ICP-AES and DNA footprinting. Silver clusters present new opportunities for molecular sensing and imaging because of their strong, activatable emission. The transformative integration of physical/analytical chemistry, molecular engineering, and photonics will create a versatile set of toolkit for diverse applications, including personalized medicine, super-resolution microscopy, and biothreat detection."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers.

However a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR) is where noise makes it easier to hear a conversation or detect a signal under certain conditions. This phenomenon has been used to model brain function and in medical devices. To fully realize its potential, we need to investigate the underlying physics using a model system. The Principal Investigator has developed such a model system consisting of magnetic nano/mesoscale particles as small as 200 atoms on a side. The magnetic state, the orientation of the North and South poles (NS) can be determined by electrical properties measured by four wires attached to each particle. The particles are so small that the NS orientation fluctuates from thermal noise. Understanding how the NS directions change with time when a small time dependent magnetic field is applied is the missing key to a fundamental understanding of SR. This fundamental understanding provides the foundation for greater applications of SR and extensions of it previous applications. In addition the nano/mesoscale particles are an ideal model system for other outstanding physics questions related to our understanding of fundamental noise theory. The research is conducted by both graduate students and undergraduates as part of their technical training in economically important advanced technologies and physics.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The research explores both the fundamental model of stochastic resonance (SR) and the untested attribution that 1/f noise is due to a collection of random telegraph noise (RTN) oscillators. Both of these long physics questions are within reach with the technology developed by the Principal Investigator (PI). This consists of the manufacture of individual magnetic particles as small as 40nm with four nonmagnetic leads attached for four terminal resistance measurements of the anisotropic magnetoresistance.  Previous research by the PI has measured RTN in individual nano/mesoscale magnetic particles. For the SR research a single dot exhibiting RTN is subjected to a small ac magnetic field. The ac field is not sufficient to drive the magnetization through the energy landscape giving rise to the RTN.  The thermal noise, however, can enable the transition between states which is at the heart of SR. Exploring the response of the magnetization as functions of ac field magnitude, temperature, particle energy barriers tests the models of SR. The hypothesis that 1/f noise evolves from a collection of uncorrelated RTN oscillators is tested by chaining individual dots exhibiting RTN and measuring the noise of both the individual dots in the chain and the total chain. The effect of correlations on the noise is measured by decreasing the separation between the dots that increases their magnetic interactions."

Labastide<br/><br/>Proposal Number: 000705861<br/><br/>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Joelle A. Labastide is ""Super-resolution Tracking of Position and Orientation During Cargo-Motor Transport."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jennifer Ross.<br/><br/>This research involves the development and implementation of a novel technique that will greatly improve understanding of how cells transport molecules such as proteins. Cells, the building blocks of all living organisms, are complex, dynamic microsystems that perform tasks necessary for life. The essential activities of cells require robust mechanisms for transporting vital elements - called cargoes - into, out of, and within the cell. From previous research, intracellular transport consists of the cell's internal network, the cytoskeleton, which is made up of microtubule and actin filaments that act as tracks, and motor proteins that move along the tracks, carrying cargoes. Some of the most important of these active transport processes are cell division and nervous system function. Without intracellular transport, the most vital of life-sustaining processes cannot occur. Due to the experimental limitations of traditional microscopy, remarkably little is known about the mechanism by which motor proteins navigate the types of complex and dense microtubule networks that are found in cells. The Fellow is designing and implementing a new microscopic technique capable of extracting highly resolved space, time, and orientation information for cargo-carrying kinesin-1 motor proteins as they navigate increasingly complex microtubule networks. The Fellow is using Polarization-Enhanced Super Resolution Imaging to construct a complete mechanistic picture of motor transport within cells. This represents a broadly applicable new imaging technique that promises many cross-disciplinary applications. <br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving interdisciplinary training that draws upon concepts in materials science, engineering, physics, and chemistry to develop new tools for improved studies of complicated biological systems, thereby broadening the experimental and technological resources available to all of these fields. Such interdisciplinary research is needed as the scientific community tackles the increasing complexity of biological issues of societal importance. The Fellow's training is providing her with a deep understanding of the relationship between physical and biological scientific disciplines, allowing her to become an effective leader and mentor to future generations of interdisciplinary scientists. To increase the participation of under-represented groups in biology, the Fellow is creating environments in the research laboratory and in the classroom that foster intellectual and cultural diversity, and emphasize the value of this diversity to the broader scientific community. The Fellow is developing a magazine that is authored, produced, and published by students and is focused on the intersection between science and cultural identity. This provides a unique opportunity for a diverse group of undergraduates, graduates, postdocs and faculty members to identify the ways in which their personal experiences and identities can serve as assets, not drawbacks, in scientific endeavors, and learn to communicate these findings to the broader university community. The personal growth opportunities provided to faculty educators and administrators through this format will be beneficial for all involved, and will increase understanding between previously disparate groups."

The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo.  Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow.  They will deduce the properties of destroyed ""dwarf"" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.  This will give insight into the properties of dwarf galaxies that did not survive until the present day. This program will train young astronomers and introduce high school students to astronomical research.<br/><br/>The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to our own. It is similar in many ways to our Milky Way galaxy, but shows evidence that it has merged with more small galaxies than the Milky Way.

Phonon is another important elementary particle that is responsible from heat and sound transfer. However, there are only limited studies focused on exploiting phonons for our needs. Harvesting phonons, specifically surface acoustic waves, could lead to new practical microfluidic devices with novel properties. Acoustic phonons can exert strong radiation forces to bioparticles (viruses, bacteria and cell) and manipulate them with high precision and efficiency. This proposal offers using phononic crystals to achieve this. Incorporation of such phononic crystals with microfluidics provides an unprecedented level of control on surface acoustic waves in microfluidic system. This capability can potentially lead to monolithic, ultra-compact, versatile and programmable microfluidic devices. Fusing of phononics and microfluidics could open door to a new world of lab-on-chip biomedical technologies and impact everyday life in previously unthinkable ways, in a similar fashion to how electrons and photons did so far. The educational component of this program is expected to provide UCSC undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary training in physics, electrical engineering and biological sciences. Outcomes of the research will be integrated in a graduate student curriculum and results will be disseminated to broader audience by presentations to middle school Girls through 'Girls in Engineering Program' and to underrepresented minorities  through 'Multicultural Engineering Program'<br/>  <br/>The objective of this research proposal is to explore the feasibility of developing microfluidic devices with new functionalities using phononic crystals on silicon substrates. Phononic crystals offer potentially unlimited ways of tailoring acoustic waves. However, to date, they have not been used in acousto-microfluidic applications, other than few simple applications related to mixing and guiding of microdroplets resting on a solid substrate in open air. Full integration of continuous flow microfluidics and phononic crystals has yet to be demonstrated. This project aims to demonstrate practical, facile utilization of phononic crystals in acoustofluidics by making use of the concepts such as band gap formation and evanescent modes of defect states. In this one-year proposal, two basic design concepts will be explored: (i) phononic crystal reflectors, and (ii) phononic crystal waveguide structures. These two structures offer a complete set of basic building blocks to achieve more complex phononic crystal microfluidics with enhanced capabilities (see motivation section below). This one-year project has four specific goals:  (1)To design phononic crystal devices with theoretical modeling and finite element  simulations. (2)To fabricate of phononic crystal devices and integrate them with interdigital transducers on a silicon substrate. (3)To characterize surface acoustic wave behavior of the integrated structures. (4)To integrate microfluidics with phononic crystals and interdigital transducers to achieve size based micro-particle separation and micro-particle guiding. The proposed research program involves numerical design of monolithic acoustofluidic systems in which particle manipulation is taken care of by phononic crystals through techniques, such as finite-element method. The devices are fabricated using well-established microfabrication techniques such as photolithography, metal deposition, soft lithography and deep reactive ion etching. In this proposal, microfuidic testing will be limited to fluorescent silica particles for rapid device development purposes."

Historically, symplectic geometry grew out of studying situations such as this, in which the collection of all possible positions and momenta of the system (phase space) was seen to have the structure of a special space known as a symplectic manifold. Physical laws, like conservation of energy, then gave rise to models of the systems as dynamical systems on submanifolds of phase space corresponding to different energy levels. Modern symplectic methods have established deep connections between global properties of symplectic manifolds and the associated dynamics on a special class of energy levels, namely contact-type hypersurfaces, but have thus far proved to be of rather limited use for a general energy level. This project aims to rectify this deficiency and use global symplectic techniques to study dynamics on arbitrary energy levels by analyzing a generalized class of curves, known as feral pseudoholomorphic curves. <br/><br/>This project concerns research at the interface of geometric analysis, symplectic topology, and dynamical systems. The key idea is the use of a certain newly defined class of infinite Hofer-energy pseudoholomorphic curves, namely feral curves, to study Hamiltonian flows on prescribed energy surfaces in symplectic manifolds of arbitrary dimension and certain volume-preserving flows on three-manifolds in general. More specifically, the aim is to study these curves and their properties and to use them to establish non-minimality of a wide range of volume preserving flows in dimension three. A further aim is to study the generic asymptotic limit of such feral curves and to determine whether or not symplectic field theory admits an extension to symplectic manifolds with generic smooth boundary. Successful completion of this research has the potential to solve the volume-preserving Gottschalk conjecture, broadly extend symplectic field theory, and possibly yield key new insights on low dimensional differential topology."

Specific directions include efficient algorithms for posterior sampling with shrinkage priors, a theoretical framework for divide and conquer strategies in big data problems, fast algorithms for clustering nodes in large networks with unknown number of communities, and methods for discovering structure in sparse contingency tables.

However, some areas that have experienced such an increase, such as in Pennsylvania and North Dakota, appear to have little if any earthquakes related to these operations.  This study seeks to better understand these geographic differences by examining whether the subsurface proximity of oil and gas operations to geologic basement rocks promotes earthquakes.  Located a few miles below the surface, the basement is comprised of igneous and metamorphic rocks that can contain numerous ancient faults.   Both hydraulic fracturing and wastewater disposal operations result in deep fluid injection occurring close to the basement may have the potential to reactivate these basement faults, producing earthquakes.  This study seeks to test this idea by improving earthquake detection, refining knowledge of how deep the basement is, and comparing these to the geographic location, depth, and timing of oil and gas operations.  In particular, the researchers will apply new processing of seismic data to better detect small earthquakes, compile detailed records of well operations from state databases, and produce regional basement-depth maps across the Central and Eastern US.  To accomplish these goals, this project will leverage new approaches to developing large-scale undergraduate research involvement.  This project will also increase knowledge transfer with geologic surveys, state regulators, and the oil and gas industry.  The researchers will continue to build on a track record of public outreach including proactive dissemination and discussion with the news media considering the national debate over hydraulic fracturing.  <br/><br/>To improve the detection of induced seismicity, this research will first employ a template matching approach that has successfully discerned induced from natural earthquakes.  This research will also utilize an emerging technology for detecting the repetitive microseismic swarms commonly associated with induced events, without requiring a previously cataloged earthquake as a template.  These approaches will be employed on seismic stations throughout the Central and Eastern US and will provide a more uniform detection of induced seismicity.  To improve basement depth characterization, this research will integrate recently constructed basement maps, particularly those by state geological surveys and regional compilations.  Deep wells will also help characterize geology between injection/hydraulic fracturing target intervals and basement to determine if the mechanical properties of these subsurface rocks may influence the occurrence of induced earthquakes.  This project will actively engage state geologic surveys in the Central and Eastern US to accomplish the project goals.  In some cases our research will benefit from existing basement, geologic, or seismicity characterizations performed by state geological surveys and other agencies.  In other cases we expect to generate and contribute this information to these institutions.  Geologic surveys are also key communicators to the general public, so this research will capitalize on the opportunities to integrate new results from this project with existing educational resources that these state surveys already provide.  This project will also utilize new undergraduate curricular structures to introduce foundational research concepts early in a student?s college career to engage a larger number of students in research project such as this one.  Mentoring will be formalized to establish thematic research teams focused on the project goals.  The results will be disseminate with and beyond the academic community, continuing to engage industry and regulators as well as the general public."

What does it mean for a fixed object to be ""random-like""? Is it possible to turn existence proofs that use the probabilistic method into explicit constructions? Is it possible to simulate randomized algorithms deterministically? When can heuristic arguments that treat the primes as a random set of integers be turned into rigorous proofs? In the setting of additive combinatorics, what is the minimal set of tests that primes have to satisfy in order to guarantee that they contain arithmetic progressions (or other structures)?<br/><br/>At a very high level, the appeal of such notions is that one can easily prove that certain properties are true for random objects, using probabilistic methods, and then transfer such properties to pseudorandom objects, provided that the pseudorandomness ?fools? the probabilistic techniques. A theme of this workshop will be how to leverage weak pseudorandomness properties, fooling simple classes of tests, in order to derive stronger pseudorandomness properties related to more complex tests. The workshop will explore unconditional constructions of pseudorandom objects at the frontier of progress, such as pseudorandom generators for small-space computations, small-depth circuits with modular gates, threshold circuits, and formulas in disjunctive normal form.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring together complexity theorists, combinatorial mathematicians, number theorists, probabilists and algorithm designers interested in the foundations and uses of pseudo-randomness.

Some of the projects on closed four-manifolds are: defining smooth and symplectic invariants and studying their properties; classifying symplectic Calabi-Yau four-manifolds and classifying configurations of Lagrangian and symplectic surfaces in rational and ruled manifolds; and investigating smooth and symplectic mapping class groups and finite symmetries. For four-manifolds with boundary, the project investigates special symplectic caps, including unruled caps and Calabi-Yau caps, with an eye towards understanding various types of symplectic fillings.

Driven by the increasing importance of online economic activity, there has been much interest in investigating its joint computational and economic characteristics through research at the interface of Computer Science and Economics. Economics brought to the table quantitative models and methodology for studying economic systems.  But it soon became clear that these models and methodology required adaptation, since the intention was to study systems that are computational while involving thousands or millions of participants. This thinking gave rise to the field of Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT), which has in the past fifteen years grown into a mature research discipline.<br/><br/>This project will identify and investigate new frontiers of research in this field, focusing on the following:<br/><br/>- Furthering our understanding of multi-item mechanisms by (i) weakening the distributional assumptions required for optimizing important objectives such as revenue; (ii) overcoming well-established computational intractability barriers for welfare maximization by moving away from truthful mechanisms to mechanisms solvable via online learning; and (iii) using optimal transport theory to characterize the structure of optimal  mechanisms.<br/><br/>- Discerning the role of learning and signaling in auction settings, by understanding how to (i) learn a revenue-optimal auction from weak forms of sample access to the bidders' distributions, (ii) test the near-optimality of a given auction from samples, and (iii) further a line of research going back to classical works of Akerlof and Milgrom-Weber by investigating how to design optimal signaling schemes for the auctioneer to use in common settings, such as sponsored search, where the auctioneer owns information about the properties of the items that the bidders do not have.<br/><br/>- Finally, revisiting the computational foundations of the field, investigating the relation between Factoring and Nash equilibrium.<br/><br/>The work in Algorithmic Game Theory is inherently interdisciplinary.

The commemoration of shared heritage through the maintenance of traditional rituals and material culture is often an important means for communities ? both past and present - to maintain integration and identity.  Nevertheless, most approaches to sustainability in the past focus on environmental and demographic factors while placing little emphasis on considerations of community commemoration and cooperation. By focusing on the material realities of community life over long time frames, archaeology is especially poised to build comprehensive accounts of sustainability that consider how the challenges of social integration and environmental adaptation are entangled. How do communities adapt their traditions and maintain solidarity as they undergo major transformations in subsistence practices and political economy? How can people deploy old practices to make new forms of social organization possible? By investigating what contributed to community sustainability in the past, social scientists can better address parallel challenges in the present. In particular, this research can inform strategies of heritage maintenance among indigenous or other marginalized communities undergoing economic transformations that threaten their ways of life and continued existence. <br/><br/><br/>Mr. Lash and his research team will investigate how members of a small island community adapted the monuments and practices of a ritual tradition as the community underwent major transformations in agriculture, political economy, and demographics in the 18th to 20th centuries. Previous scholarship suggests that ritual practices can foster shared heritage and identity by maintaining monuments from the past as places of collective access and commemoration. From c. 1750-1960, islanders on Inishark in western Ireland visited a series of monuments as part of annual ritual processions dedicated to St Leo. Scattered around islanders? houses and field plots, these monuments were remnants of a monastery abandoned centuries earlier. To assess the impact of this ritual tradition on community sustainability, research will trace how the use, abandonment, renovation, and destruction of ritual monuments corresponds across time with transitions in village agriculture, landholding, and demographics. Combining oral history, archival documents, and excavation of four monuments will reconstruct the changing practices and spatial dynamics of the ritual tradition. Results will test common assumptions about the capacity of heritage maintenance to support political economic formations by structuring community members? movements and commemorations. A research team of American, Irish, and local collaborators will generate a dataset that will enhance archaeological analyses of sustainability and inform local initiatives that incorporate archaeological heritage as a key cultural and economic resource."

The primary research goal is to build model heterostructures and understand the principles that relate their structure to their electronic and photonic properties. This project combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including microspectroscopy to assess the optical properties, conductivity measurements to assess electronic coupling and charge transfer, and photoemission spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations to assess band structure. Ultimately, an understanding of the structure-property relationships in these heterostructures can provide an important framework for designing the optoelectronic properties of these new materials."

Oxy-combustion is also considered a potential near-term option for enhancing carbon capture and storage (CCS), by producing a high concentration CO2 stream that can be more readily recovered due to combustion of fuels using oxygen and recycled flue gas (primarily CO2). Circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers are well-suited for utilizing low- and high-quality coals, and can adapt to a wide range of biomass feedstocks. Pulverized-coal (PC) boilers represent the most widespread type of coal-fired combustion system used for power generation, and have been the subject of many biomass co-firing demonstrations. In addition, the use of oxy-combustion at high pressures allows for improved thermodynamic efficiencies for power generation with CCS, as well as increased partial pressure of CO2 to facilitate CCS. Thus, the integration of these various technologies provides a great opportunity to address the pressing need of greenhouse gas control. The University of Utah, Zhejiang University and the University of Wyoming have considerable research experience, in both pulverized-coal (PC) and circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) systems, to investigate fundamental aspects related to the integration of oxy-fired combustion with co-firing of biomass and coal under high-pressure operation. <br/><br/>The project will utilize bench-scale high-pressure reactors to perform research under both CFB and PC-fired combustion conditions. The project focuses on fundamental investigations of 2 key research areas that must be addressed before widespread adoption of biomass/coal co-firing in high-pressure, oxy-fuel PC and CFB combustors can be realized. These areas are: 1) fundamental characteristics of biomass/coal co-pyrolysis and co-combustion under pressurized oxy-fuel conditions, and 2) mineral matter transformations during pressurized oxy-fuel co-firing of coal and biomass. The work represents the nexus of 3 different technologies: coal/biomass co-firing, oxy-fuel combustion and high-pressure combustion. While there have been some studies published on each of these technologies, or combinations of two of them, there is no fundamental information in the literature on the combination of all 3 technologies. This project will address this scientific void through a detailed investigation of these combined technologies for both PC-fired and CFB combustion scenarios. The research will lay a foundation for the expansion of biomass utilization in power generation, particularly under high-efficiency conditions, which would make a significant contribution to reductions in the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Since China is currently a world leader in the implementation of CFB technology for electric power generation, and is also one of the world leaders in the number of new PC-fired power generation systems being constructed each year, their participation will provide a potential pathway for commercial adoption of the proposed technologies"

Information obtained from this research can contribute to genetic engineering of maize to improve yield under high planting densities. Powerful tools used and developed in this research will revolutionize how RNA structure and function are studied.

The merger of these arrays allows (1) study of the known phenomenon of gamma ray emission by lightning with a wide aperture detector capable of reconstructing gamma showers generated by lightning strikes, and (2) a search for the long-speculated ""seeding"" of lightning strikes by cosmic ray air showers. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>It has been known for over a decade that x-ray and gamma radiation (~100 keV to 10 MeV) is emitted by lightning strikes. This phenomenon has been observed by ground-based detectors in association with both natural and induced lightning, and by space-based detectors. Recently, physicists studying data collected by the 700 square kilometer TA Surface Detector (SD) in Western Utah, U.S.A. have observed energetic elementary particles in coincidence with lightning strikes. In a subset of these events, ""showers"" have been reconstructed which point back to the particles' origin in the Earth's atmosphere. This has not been seen before, and it implies that the energetic radiation may be traced to particular times and features within the lightning strike.<br/><br/>The LMA is the ideal instrument to couple with the TA SD in order to perform these studies. A version of this instrument used for site testing purposes has been temporarily located at the TA site. The LMA consists of nine VHF detectors, spread over hundreds of square kilometers, which detect impulsive radiation from lightning. These impulses may be reconstructed with 10 microsecond timing accuracy and better than 100 meter position accuracy, and used to create a 3-dimensional GPS-timed reconstruction of a lightning strike.<br/><br/>The merger of TA/LMA is also the ideal instrument to search for evidence of a more speculative - but more profound - connection between particle astrophysics and climate: The seeding of lightning strikes by cosmic ray air showers. Since the electric fields present in thunderstorms are typically an order-of-magnitude less than the 30 kV/cm needed for dielectric breakdown of air, it is evident that something else must be assisting the process. The TA/LMA synergy will have the unique ability to search for cosmic ray coincidences with lightning, adding a tantalizing piece of speculative research to its capabilities.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The synergy will create a rare opportunity for particle astrophysics research to have such a direct impact on the national priority of meteorological research. Electrical storms in the atmosphere have had a profound impact on the development of life on Earth, and continue to shape individual human lives and society. Yet mysteries remain as to the causes and nature of lightning. A large cosmic ray observatory is the ideal pairing with a lightning detector to probe two of these mysteries: (1) From where within a lightning strike do high-energy particles arise? (2) Can cosmic ray air showers provide the ""seed"" of atmospheric dielectric breakdown? For the relatively modest cost of maintaining a lightning mapping array, the TA/LMA observatory will become an important showpiece illustrating the benefits of NSF Particle Astrophysics to society as a whole."

In mathematics, it underlies the ""probabilistic method,"" a method to prove that certain mathematical objects with desired properties exist, by simply picking an object at random, and arguing that with a positive probability, the object has the required properties. In computer science, randomness is a powerful tool in algorithm design. Randomized algorithms are often simpler or perform better than their deterministic counterparts, and have found applications in many fields such as graph algorithms, linear programming, routing algorithms, coding theory, communication protocols, approximation algorithms, cryptography, and many more.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons that randomness is ubiquitous in algorithm design, is that typically the probabilistic method shows that the desired events, which control the success of the algorithm, not only occur with a positive probability (which would be sufficient to prove existence), but that they in fact occur with overwhelming probability. As such, it immediately lends itself to the design of randomized algorithms.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is on regimes where this is not the case. There are several probabilistic techniques which can prove the existence of ""rare events."" That is, they show that the desired events occur with a positive (yet tiny) probability. Although we do not have many such techniques, they have proven to be extremely valuable, with applications in many domains: combinatorial optimization, learning theory, approximation algorithms, distributed algorithms, computational geometry, numerical analysis, and more. The main reason is that such techniques, and more importantly, their algorithmic realizations, provide algorithm designers with new sets of tools that they can apply that go beyond ""vanilla"" probabilistic techniques.<br/><br/>This project will focus both on the development of new mathematical and algorithmic tools and techniques, as well as on their assimilation by students and researchers. This involves mentoring students, creating and teaching relevant classes, writing expository surveys, and organizing workshops.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the project focuses on two main domains. The first is discrepancy theory. Discrepancy theory studies irregularities within distributions, and has intimate relations with rounding techniques for integer programs, and more generally with combinatorial optimization. There are several important open problems in discrepancy theory (most notably the Komlos conjecture), which this project sets a concrete plan to resolve.<br/><br/>The second domain is pseudo-randomness. Pseudo-randomness is the study of deterministic objects which attain certain properties satisfied by random objects. As such, this is a wide area of study, with many applications both in mathematics and computer science. In this project, we focus on pseudorandom objects which, for some bounded family of tests, behave exactly like random objects. While in some settings such objects are deeply understood and widely applied (for example, k-wise independence, which has applications in coding theory, data structures, de-randomization, and more), in many other settings they are much less understood. This project explores new approaches to better understand such objects and to develop new algorithmic applications of them."

If successful, the project will increase the switching speed of organic transistors by an order of magnitude, which will accelerate commercialization of flexible electronics. Additionally, the reduction of base currents of Organic Permeable Base Transistors will open new fields of application such as flexible backplanes for active matrix displays.<br/>To broaden the impact of the project, additional measures aim at leveraging the research and using it as a vehicle to improve STEM education. The PI will develop courses targeted at high school teachers offering ""College Credit Plus"" classes. These ""College Credit Plus"" classes allow high school students to earn college credit early and free of cost, which has the potential to increase the enrollment in STEM degrees. Furthermore, selected work-packages of the proposal will be offered as Senior Honors Project to a student majoring in physics and mathematics. Furthermore, graduate students will be trained in a socially important research area, which will make them part of a globally competitive workforce. Students will participate in a summer school jointly organized with Case Western Reserve University providing them with all necessary background in organic semiconductors, device physics, and device engineering.<br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this project is to unravel the origin of base currents in Organic Permeable Base Transistors. The specific research objectives are a) to prove that a drift-diffusion simulation of the device can quantitatively reproduce the device behavior, in particular the magnitude of base currents and b) to test the hypothesis that a self-assembled monolayer on top of the base electrode can significantly reduce base leakage currents.<br/>A quantitative agreement between the drift-diffusion simulation and experiment will be reached by a thorough characterization of the morphology of the base electrode and of the charge transport in all layers of the Organic Permeable Base Transistor. In particular, the growth of the porous base electrode and the nature of base currents will be studied by scanning probe methods, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical characterization of test devices. Self-organized layers of insulating phosphonic acids will be grown on top of the base. Charge transport across these layers will be quantified and modeled, leading to a concise description of Organic Permeable Base Transistors operating at significantly increased current amplification and thus lower static power dissipation.<br/>As a result of the project, an experimentally validated model of the Organic Permeable Base Transistor will become available to the scientific community, which will significantly enhance the fundamental understanding of the device and will enable a rational design of Organic Permeable Base Transistors. Furthermore, the project will increase the knowledge on vertical charge transport in poly-crystalline organic films and will provide detailed charge carrier mobility models for standard materials used in Organic Permeable Base Transistors. Clarifying the nature of base currents will improve the understanding of injection into a disordered organic semiconductor and will lead to a quantitative description of injection from oxidized aluminum into the organic semiconductor C60."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

The second project studies model reduction methods used in complex multiscale chemical reactions, biochemical networks, and combustion by incorporating also the effects of diffusion. The third project involves a completely new class of solutions, known as torus canards, found in models from neuroscience.

In the pattern formation project, paradigm reaction-diffusion systems will be studied. The goals are to develop new analytical techniques and mathematical theory for determining the boundaries of the stable pattern-forming regimes, analyzing the stability of semi-strong pulse interactions, modeling the scattering of pulses in 1-D systems and spots in 2-D systems, extending renormalization group methods for stability of modulating pulses, and predicting the dynamic bifurcations of pulses and fronts. The second project centers on accurate model reduction methods for large-scale combustion, chemical, and biochemical systems exhibiting multiple time scales. The goals are to analyze, develop, and improve cutting-edge model reduction methods for finding the low-dimensional manifolds that govern the effective system dynamics in the presence of diffusion. In the third project, the new phenomena of torus canards and canards in partial differential equations will be investigated. A theory of generic torus canards will be developed for fast-slow systems with multi-dimensional fast and slow variables. Known to exist in many neuroscience models, such as the Hindmarsh-Rose equations, the Morris-Lecar-Terman model, the Wilson-Cowan-Izhikevich system, and the forced van der Pol equation, torus canards are critical in the transition regimes between tonic spiking and bursting. A detailed study will also be carried out of the new bursting rhythms known as amplitude-modulated bursting rhythms. The fourth project will study the impacts of cut-offs on the reaction terms, introduced to accurately model regions of low particle densities, on the speeds, shapes, and stability of propagating fronts. A series of important problems related to fourth-order models, two-dimensional space dynamics, front initiation, and front pre-cursors will be studied."

Weaving together strands of psychology, neuroscience, economics, and education, researchers at Wesleyan University and Boston College shed light on the cognitive processes underlying our abilities to estimate 4 kinds of quantities: number, space, time, and probability. By comparing processes across these four distinct areas, the researchers aim to provide a unifying account of how children and adults estimate quantities, which has the potential to transform current understanding of the cognitive bases of how people learn in and across STEM disciplines. Achieving a simple unifying account is important because the ability to think well about quantity in all of these areas is fundamental to STEM learning. Other educational benefits include the establishment of partnerships with local museums that allow the research team to collect data from a diverse population while also supporting the museum's public education efforts. This project also contributes to STEM workforce development by training undergraduate students through a service-learning course offered at Wesleyan, and through a summer research internship exchange across the two universities. These aspects of the project, taken with its robust theoretical grounding, well-formulated research questions and tests of competing models of how people reason about quantity in childhood and adulthood, demonstrate its potential to guide and improve the design of STEM learning environments for all citizens.<br/><br/>This project exemplifies the Education and Human Resources Core Research program's commitment to fundamental research on learning in STEM that combines theory, techniques, and perspectives from a wide range of disciplines and contexts.  Specifically, it aims to provide a unifying account of how children and adults estimate quantities across four distinct domains: the development of numerical estimation; spatial categorization (remembering the location of items in space); the theoretical neuroscience of time processing (reproducing temporal durations); and decision making under risk (the processing of probabilities). Through a series of behavioral studies with adults and children, the researchers will test their hypothesis that proportion judgment underlies basic quantity estimation across these domains, across development, and across contexts (varying task constraints). This work is important because -- despite striking similarities in behaviors described across research in these literatures -- each one conceptualizes them quite differently, positing different accounts of the underlying mechanisms that yield quantity judgments. The project will advance and potentially transform our understanding of mental representations and processes involved in quantity judgments while also providing insight into how quantity biases may influence the processing of numerical information in educational contexts and real-life decisions. In this way the project builds a coherent, cumulative knowledge base, focusing on high-leverage topics."

In this project, the investigators plan to examine water- and carbon-containing minerals of relevance under the high-pressure and high temperature conditions under which they release water and carbon dioxide to determine: (1) their properties that govern when water or carbon dioxide are released at depth; and (2) whether water or carbon dioxide are released gradually or abruptly. These results will constrain how the water that ultimately generates circum-Pacific volcanism via water-induced melting is released at depth in the planet, and help in the modeling of magma production at depth; and will explore how carbon dioxide is released at depth and the form in which it might be transported to the surface. Thus, these results have fundamental relevance for the production of volcanism at continental margins, and for how deep subduction-related earthquakes (which are likely greased by fluids) are generated. In conducting these experiments, the group will spearhead the development of a new facility, which will be available to the scientific community as a whole, which is designed to conduct high-pressure/high-temperature characterizations of materials at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. The group extensively engages undergraduates in its research effort, and the graduate students supported by this grant include a military veteran. The results are also incorporated into undergraduate curricula at the PI's institution.<br/><br/>The investigator team plans to: (1) examine the properties of important carriers of volatiles into Earth's mantle at simultaneous high pressures and high temperatures using high precision single-crystal x-ray diffraction; and (2) characterize the properties of carbonates of relevance to carbonatite petrogenesis at high pressures using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. In tandem with the first objective, the establishment of a new, community-accessible, high-pressure/high-temperature synchrotron-based single crystal x-ray diffraction facility will be facilitated by this support.  The cycling of water and carbon dioxide into and out of Earth's interior are pivotal processes that impact both the properties of the solid Earth (through their effects on melting and rheology) and Earth's surface (through the volume of the hydrosphere and the composition of Earth's atmosphere). The team proposes to probe the properties of volatile-bearing phases under subduction conditions to gain insights into: (1) the polymorphism of volatile-bearing phases in Earth's mantle (or, what is degassing at depth); (2) the structures of volatile-bearing phases at high-pressures and temperatures (to examine why these phases hold volatiles); and (3) how phases that are known to carry water to depth (and particularly lawsonite and phengitic micas) behave as they approach (and hopefully exceed) their dehydration conditions.  They also will provide new constraints on the rich polymorphism of phases associated with the binding of the carbonate ion under mantle conditions: the focus here will be on alkali-rich carbonates, which have recently been demonstrated to be associated with deep carbonatite melting, and which have largely been uninterrogated at high pressure conditions. The team will utilize this project to deploy two graduate students to assist, work through, shake down and debug a new, world-class high-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction set-up that will be set-up and commissioned over the next year at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL). This facility will be available to the community as a whole through the General User Program proposal process of the ALS (the facility will also be part of the COMPRES-Consortium's Approved Program at the ALS, and thus will have assistance for users who are awarded time). In addition to this deployment of new community infrastructure, the PI will: (1) contribute to the education of a diverse group of graduate students (currently, one military veteran, one returning female) and undergraduates; (2) continue to publish/contribute to the literature on topics of broad interest for those interested in the natural history of the planet (and promote these as appropriate with press releases); and (3) incorporate new results into UCSC undergraduate teaching (typically, to ~90 earth sciences majors per year)."

The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Virginia Walbot.<br/><br/>The fellowship activities are focused on understanding early anther development in maize. As a reproductive organ of a major crop plant, the maize anther plays a central role in many processes of agronomic importance. Defects in early anther development lead to male sterility, decreasing grain number and yield in many cereal crops. Furthermore, one of the earliest causes of yield loss in response to heat and drought is pollen inviability; thus, understanding anther development and male fertility will be important to insuring food security in the face of climate change. This project will increase knowledge of basic reproductive biology, information that can ultimately lead to breakthroughs in crop breeding and yield enhancement. The fellowship activities will also promote teaching and learning both within academia and in the general public. The fellow will lead an undergraduate-focused outreach project to design and market educational materials, helping to communicate the broad importance of the plant sciences to the community and stimulating collaboration between undergraduates from scientific fields and other disciplines. Further educational outreach will include mentoring undergraduate and high school students in laboratory research.<br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this research is to uncover early events in the development of archesporial (AR) cells--the first cell type within the anther committed to meiosis and pollen production. Major aims are to (1) identify cellular intermediates as AR cells differentiate into meiocytes and (2) investigate the role of TGA-type transcription factors in AR cell specification. These aims will be pursued using a combination of genomics, genetics, and biochemistry. Single-cell RNA sequencing will allow the identification of distinct AR cell populations, which will then be ordered into a developmental pathway by integrating transcriptome data with in situ localization of RNA transcripts. The subcellular localization, redox status, and DNA binding activity of several TGA transcription factors will be assessed in early stage anthers under various genetic and physiological perturbations, and downstream signaling pathways for the TGA factors will be evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Together, the fellowship activities will generate substantial transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data, clarify the differentiation program of AR cell development, and help to characterize the regulation and signaling of TGA family transcription factors during AR cell specification in a spatio-temporal context. Research results will be presented at national conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence data will be submitted to public repositories such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)."

The in situ 3D imaging capability of the proposed microscopes makes them valuable characterization techniques complementary to other conventional methods, such as electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Both teams are also designing single molecule imaging experiments to study multi-step catalytic reactions, in which two or more chemical transformations are catalyzed with a nanoscale-engineered multifunctional catalyst to avoid the need for separation, purification, and transfer of intermediates produced in each step. Graduate and undergraduate students in these two institutions acquire valuable skills in building catalytic nanostructures and in developing new instrumental capabilities to understand molecular transport and catalysis at the single-molecule level. High school students in the Atlanta and Ames area are exposed to the concepts of imaging, nanoscience, and catalysis to enhance STEM education in high schools. <br/><br/>In this work well-defined heterogeneous catalytic systems, whereby colloidal nanoparticles are embedded within core-shell mesoporous silica materials of aligned channels, are developed.

In this study, a novel device concept based on new materials is being explored to replace traditional silicon-based transistors, with the goal of lowering the operating power. Specifically, a new type of polymer electrolyte (i.e., ion conducting polymer) is designed to induce strain in a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor when an electric field is applied. The 2D semiconductor has a thickness of only one molecule. The strain changes the electrical properties of the 2D semiconductor, which can then be sensed to perform logic operations. The change is predicted to occur at voltages lower than ones used in conventional transistors, and therefore the power required to operate the device is lower. In addition to applications in nanoelectronics, this research advances new materials for phase change devices that respond to electrical, chemical or strain stimuli, with potential application in brain-inspired computing, and artificial synapses. The postdoctoral scholar, graduate and undergraduate students who work on this project benefit from an interdisciplinary project that combines chemistry, polymer science, inorganic materials science and device physics with the goal of engineering low-power transistors. The research component provides educational case studies to be used in the classroom, and interdisciplinary training of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Technical Description:  A new approach to strain 2D crystals is being explored using a field-effect transistor (FET) with a suspended MoTe2 channel for which the gate oxide is replaced by a custom-synthesized ionomer (i.e., single-ion conductor). Gate bias induces an electrostatic imbalance in the ionomer that strains the 2D crystal and induces a semiconducting to metallic phase change. The phase change is detected by the current-voltage characteristics of the FET, and is expected to occur at sub-volt gate bias with nanosecond switching times. This approach offers a gate control architecture that is similar to conventional CMOS architecture but with new materials and new physics. The research addresses both a fundamental and a practical challenge for dynamically controlling the phase behavior of 2D crystals. The fundamental challenge is achieving strain in 2D crystals that is sufficiently large to induce the phase transition; here, electrostatic control via ions is used to address this challenge. The practical challenge is building an electronic device that can exploit this phase-change property for low-power transistors, brain-inspired computing, or the development of artificial synapses."

These algebras were discovered in the 1980s in the process of solving problems in theoretical quantum physics. They are mathematical systems that model rings of functions on geometric structures as in algebraic geometry (the study of geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations) except that the multiplication is noncommutative. The internal structure of quantum algebras will be intensively investigated, particularly those substructures that correspond to points and geometric subspaces in the classical analogs, together with relations between quantum and classical algebras that are connected via a semiclassical limit (a process in which the noncommutativity tends to zero). These commutative semiclassical limit algebras carry a remnant of the noncommutativity of the associated quantum algebras, recorded in a bilinear form called a Poisson bracket. The work will also pursue the closely related questions about Poisson algebras, as well as the classical-quantum interplay between Poisson semiclassical limits and their quantum counterparts. The research aims both to advance, and to tighten the links among, several highly active mathematical areas -- quantum groups, Poisson algebra, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and cluster theory. In particular, the work will furnish tools to pass insights from one area to the others. <br/><br/>Specific projects include the exploitation of cluster algebra structures on large classes of quantum and Poisson algebras towards the ideal theory of these algebras. A related effort will go into the construction of more viable bridges over which to shift information back and forth between quantum algebras and their semiclassical limits. Along this line, the investigator conjectures that the prime and primitive spectra of a quantum algebra are homeomorphic to the Poisson-prime and Poisson-primitive spectra of a semiclassical limit, and he will devote major effort towards a confirmation. Other projects target the classical-quantum interplay. The goal is to develop noncommutative versions of properties enjoyed by commutative coordinate rings, prominent among them being catenarity of their prime spectra. The work will explore the conjecture that all quantized coordinate rings enjoy catenarity. These efforts are related to the goal of elucidating the global topological structures of the prime and primitive spectra of quantum algebras. This is aimed at gluing the (already secured) classical pieces of these spectra via auxiliary spaces and maps that are not required in the classical setting. Establishing a specific, detailed format for this gluing and auxiliary data, together with similar, matching formats for the spectra of quantum algebras and semiclassical limits, would yield explicit homeomorphisms between these spectra, and thus establish the conjectured quantum-Poisson interplay."

However, we know little about how their movements affect the spread of disease. This research will combine measures of insect behavior with mathematical models of disease risk and make predictions about how disease transmission may respond to environmental change.  In addition to sharing their results with other scientists, the researchers will train K-12 teachers at the world-class education program at Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research site (CDR), and develop teaching modules about disease for students in grades 7-16. The researchers will also partner with CDR's NSF ESTEEM project to involve Native American students in ecology research. The project will promote interaction between biologists and mathematicians, and between researchers who study disease and insect behavior. <br/><br/>The interaction between movement and disease is increasingly recognized as an emerging frontier for both the fields of movement ecology and the ecology of infectious diseases. For pathogens transmitted by insects, insect vector movement is a key component of the infection process. Yet, in most ecological disease models, vector behavior is highly simplified. A deeper understanding of the role of vector movement and foraging behavior in mediating population-level infectious disease risk is an important frontier spanning population, disease, and behavioral ecology. The approach proposed here couples a novel modeling approach with a tractable experimental system and promotes understanding of vector-host-pathogen interactions in three parts. First, the modeling approach enables the incorporation of context-dependent decision making in vector movement and will generate expected trends for vectored pathogens in animal and plant systems, broadly. Second, the proposed experimental work will use a globally relevant phytovirus-aphid system that permits experiments that are near impossible in other (plant and animal) vectored disease systems. Finally, existing field data will be used to test model predictions about the importance of vector behavior for infection in response to environmental change under field conditions. By generating predictions from a behavioral modeling framework and an experimentally-tractable empirical system, the proposed theory-experiment pairing promises novel insights into the likely role of vector behavior in the dynamics of a wide array of vectored diseases."

These applications require that thin oxide films be doped with small amounts of a different chemical element that improves the electrical conductivity of the film without changing its structure. For example, fluorine-doped tin oxide is used as an electrically conductive coating on glass in photovoltaic cells and in gas sensors. When tin oxide combines with an equal amount of barium oxide, a ceramic compound known as barium stannate forms. It has a more complex structure known as a perovskite, and its properties are extremely dependent on the perfection of the film. Initial experiments on barium stannate demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivities that can enable the development of a new class of microelectronics based on metal oxides. Depositing films with exact elemental ratios that are free of defects is difficult. This research studies the fundamental factors controlling the deposition of high quality tin oxide and barium stannate films. An important broader impact of this combined experimental and computational research is the production of videos that can be used to explain to students and the general public the events involved in the deposition processes.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Through a combination of experimental and theoretical/computational techniques, the researchers are identifying fundamental factors at the atomic and molecular level of detail that influence the rates and quality of crystal growth in binary and ternary tin oxides. Mechanistic knowledge gained from this work is aiding in the design of new molecular precursors and deposition processes. In addition, a separate chemometric approach offers a potentially powerful tool for rapid in-silico screening of alternative precursors with the goal of prioritizing experiments to focus on molecular precursors having a high likelihood of utility. An initial group of six tin precursors, including metal alkyls, amides and nitrates, is being used to deposit tin oxides in an ultrahigh vacuum reactor. Growth rates, measured in situ by using time-dependent intensity oscillations in the reflection high energy electron diffraction peaks, are studied as a function of substrate temperature, precursor and oxygen pressure, aiming to elucidate the deposition kinetics to be used as the basis for designing depositions of ternary tin oxides having the perovskite structure. In these depositions, molecular precursors are used as the tin source and effusion cells are used as sources for the group-two elements with the ultimate goal to understand the underlying design principles for chemical precursors that lead to self-regulating stoichiometry control."

Such materials are used in ultrafast laser spectroscopy and, more recently, to generate ultraviolet laser light for nanolithographic applications. Current research and engineering activities in the field of NLO materials typically concern synthesis of NLO crystals; however, research is needed for understanding how to design NLO materials and why materials exhibit a particular NLO response. While exploring the fundamental driving factors for creation of new NLO materials, research will be performed to grow large (on the order of one cubic centimeter) single crystals to allow a quantitative understanding of the interaction of light with the NLO material. These analyses of basic principles by graduate students and postdoctoral associates -- who are also engaged in local education, teaching, mentoring, and leadership -- will enhance scientific progress and promote commercial expansion of this technologically important field.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Emerging technologies require high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that exhibit enhanced optical properties at the microscopic and macroscopic level. The rational design of crystal structures, in particular noncentrosymmetric materials, and how to target polar, polar-chiral, and chiral structures, is an ongoing theme in crystal engineering. A new class of potentially high performance NLO inorganic materials, solid-state oxide-fluorides, has been identified.  These studies demonstrate that i) the use of fluoride ligands with early-transition metals enhances the second-order Jahn-Teller distortion in comparison to pure oxide compounds, ii) the synthesis of noncentrosymmetric materials can be promoted with the use of polar basic-building units, and iii) the synthesis of compounds that contain two separate anionic building units is likely to result in a noncentrosymmetric compound. These materials comprise a large and new class of solids with properties associated with piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, ferroelectricity and second harmonic generation (SHG). The structure-property relationships that give rise to high, low, or null nonlinearities of the NLO materials will be examined. Finally, the growth of large crystals (on the order of one cubic centimeter) allows detailed analysis with measurements of the NLO tensor and phase-matchability properties, and other properties of interest such as piezoelectricity.  The materials synthesized will have potential use in relaxor ferroelectrics and non-linear optics. These materials will have a high damage threshold and the potential to fabricate large, single crystals suitable for optical use and technical applications. <br/><br/>The project is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research."

This research project continues investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory, SPDE, and the geometry of random fractals. Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDE that are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise.  Further pursuit of these connections is expected to yield novel insights into the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related SPDE."

Evangelista<br/><br/>Proposal Number:  1608559<br/><br/>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dominic A. Evangelista is ""Evolution and diversification of Blaberoid cockroaches."" The primary host institution for this fellowship is Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN) of Paris, France and the sponsoring scientists are Frederic Legendre (of the MNHN) and Akito Kawahara (co-sponsoring at Florida Museum of Natural History).  Funding is provided in partnership with NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).<br/><br/>Understanding how shifts in biodiversity are driven by biotic and abiotic factors is a major goal of evolutionary biology. This project explores phylogenetic diversification using as a model lineage the cockroaches (the super-family Blaberoidea), a group that is ubiquitous, diverse, and economically important. Blaberoid cockroaches are highly diverse (3600 species) and there are no tested hypotheses for what drove their diversification. The Fellow is exploring three paradigms as diversity drivers: 1) Large changes in genital morphology that prevent interbreeding of lineages; 2) evolution of novel parental care strategies; and 3) invasion of new biogeographical ranges.  The questions addressed by this research include: (1) What is the phylogeny of Blaberoidea?; (2) Where on the phylogenetic tree, and when in evolutionary time, did the major increases in diversification rates occur in Blaberoidea?; and (3) Which evolutionary events (as in the three paradigms above) best predict increases in diversity? The first goal is being achieved through phylogenetic reconstruction using thorough taxon sampling, next-gen sequencing and phylogenomic methods. Using the phylogenetic tree, a major product of this research, the Fellow is identifying points where there have been increases in diversification rates. Shifts in these rates are then being used in the context of trait changes to understand how traits may have driven diversification in Blaberoidea.<br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving advanced training in next-generation phylogenetic methods and engaging in several broader impacts including: (1) mentoring students, (2) providing science outreach to young people, and (3) generating intellectual products with a societal impact. The Fellow is training undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art techniques including Illumina sequencing, library prep, targeted enrichment and phylogenetic methodology. As an American scientist travelling abroad, the Fellow is taking advantage of the opportunity to do science outreach in a community where he has a novel cultural perspective. Specifically, he is doing numerous outreach events at local grade schools, including insect display exhibitions, interactions with live pet cockroaches, and an age-appropriate research talk. The goals of these events are to expose students to insect biodiversity, show science as an achievable career, and communicate research findings. This project involves insects that illicit strong reactions among the general population. By broadly publicizing the research findings, the Fellow is teaching the general public about the amazing biodiversity of cockroaches and providing more positive attention to these interesting insects."

The goal of this project is to identify the signal that cells sense when interacting with aligned fibrils in a fibrin gel and exhibit contact guidance. The project will specifically test the hypotheses that the directional dependences of stiffness and adhesion of the network of aligned fibrils are the major contributing signals. This will be accomplished by systematically changing only the stiffness directional components of the fibrin network and observing whether or not the contact guidance response of fibroblasts in the fibrin gel changes, and then conducting similar studies with blocking antibodies to modulate adhesion and thereby modulate a potential adhesion directional dependent signal.   Beyond the fundamental value in answering the question regarding what signal cells sense when detecting aligned fibrils, the research should lead to improved engineered tissues by providing a rationale for designing fibrillar scaffolds that yield the desired cell alignment and the associated tissue mechanical function. <br/><br/>Contact guidance is a fundamental cell behavior key to multiple physiological processes and tissue engineering strategies. While it has been highly studied on planar substrata, and even related to the cell cytoskeleton for certain geometries, it has been little studied in aligned fibrillar networks such as native tissues or the reconstituted collagen and fibrin gels that are used as tissue models.  Despite its importance, the mechanism underlying cell contact guidance in an aligned fibrillar network has defied elucidation due to multiple interdependent signals that such a network presents to cells, including anisotropy of adhesion, porosity, and stiffness.  The proposed research combines several key technologies along with appropriate experimental design to test the hypothesis that contact guidance is primarily driven by sensing of anisotropic stiffness or adhesion in the local fibrillar network.  By forming magnetically-aligned fibrin gels with the same alignment strength, but crosslinked to different extents, the anisotropic stiffness and anisotropic adhesion hypotheses of contact guidance will be tested. Cell orientation behavior and the dynamic pattern of cell protrusions will be evaluated for fibroblasts seeded on the gel post-crosslinking, which preliminary data show increases stiffness anisotropy and yields stronger contact guidance. Crosslinking is achieved using a ruthenium-catalyzed photocrosslinking method that forms dityrosine bonds in tyrosine-rich fibrin fibrils. Experiments will be conducted to confirm preliminary findings that the crosslinking only affects stiffness anisotropy and does not affect anisotropy of adhesion or porosity, which are confounding effects in reported contact guidance studies to date. The effects of modifying cell adhesion using antibodies to binding sites on fibronectin and cognate b1 integrins will similarly be evaluated in these contact guidance experiments, which can be related to the anisotropic adhesion hypothesis. Adhesion will be quantified with a centrifugation assay of fibroblasts seeded on fibrin gels and porosity (more generally network microstructure) will be quantified from analysis of 3D reconstructions from confocal image stacks.  Beyond the fundamental value of the proposed studies in answering the question--What signal do cells sense when detecting aligned fibrils?-- the research should lead to improved engineered tissues by providing a rationale for design of fibrillar scaffolds so as to yield the desired strength of cell alignment and the associated tissue mechanical function.  Educational impact is achieved through enhanced courses, access to a shared imaging system that will facilitate interactions between students and engineers from local industries and collaborations expected with cell biologists."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

Algebraic geometry is the mathematical study of spaces described by arbitrary algebraic equations. Fundamental investigation of such diverse scientific disciplines as high energy physics, cryptography, phylogenetics, robotics, or control theory, often reveals that key concepts of the discipline can be encoded in terms of such geometric spaces. In some cases, such interactions suggest deep new problems in algebraic geometry whose solution is necessary for further progress. In other instances, the scientific intuition actually suggests new methods for solving old problems in algebraic geometry that were otherwise inaccessible. String theory and quantum field theory (QFT) explore physics at the smallest length scales, or correspondingly at the highest energy levels. Exploration of the interactions of these physical theories with algebraic geometry has been extremely productive for both math and physics, and the power of this combination of tools and approaches only seems to strengthen with time.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore and push forward the interface of algebraic geometry with string theory. This will be done by focusing on a number specific research directions, each representing a major open problem in math and/or in physics, whose solution will make a major contribution to the field, and is likely to benefit from the application of techniques of the opposite discipline. Specifically, the principal investigator proposes to explore the extension of the classical theory of curves and their moduli to super Riemann surfaces, with a view towards establishing the foundations of perturbative superstring theories and studying the superstring measure; to prove the geometric Langlands conjecture via non abelian Hodge theory, and explore its relation to QFT and to mirror symmetry; to extend his construction of Calabi-Yau integrable systems realizing Hitchin's system to meromorphic and parabolic versions, and explore the physical applications; to use his new parametrization of the moduli space of 6 dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties to analyze this space and  determine its Kodaira dimension; and to explore further aspects of F theory and attempt to establish its mathematical foundations."

Further, while online degrees are fairly commonplace in many sectors of higher education, career-technical education lags behind in part due to the hands-on fieldwork requirements of such programs. Motivated by the demand for an energy management workforce, this project brings together the LCC EMP education with online education.  The result being the Independent Learner Energy Education Design (ILEED) effort, which provides a scalable solution of changing the current LCC EMP traditional classroom model into an online hybrid option that expands energy efficiency educational opportunities to traditional and nontraditional students, but also a broader and more diverse population across the Pacific Northwest. This project also serves to develop, manage, and support a network of utility mentor partners that will provide the essential energy-related fieldwork at multiple remote locations. Northwest utilities and utility professional associations have agreed to provide employee-mentors for this innovative education project.<br/><br/>To increase participation of a wider sector of potential students, and to cover a broader geographic range, ILEED updates the existing online coursework and couples it with fieldwork experiences through local, public utilities and industry connections (similar to that of an internship or cooperative education). With this model of higher education and industry partnerships, energy management education will be available to students who are currently outside the local area. ILEED faculty will still teach and assess, but also coordinate with industry mentors so ILEED students can complete their field-work component of instruction, regardless of their geographic location.

The stability of such structures (i.e. their ability to retain their form when disturbed) is of great practical importance, as waves that are not stable do not naturally manifest themselves in physical applications, except possibly for transient phenomena.  The aim of this project is to provide researchers a mathematically rigorous theory by which they may distinguish between mathematical solutions that are stable, and hence have a possibility of being manifested in reality, and those that are not.

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising interdisciplinary scholar at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience and economics. In this project, the goal is to explore how decision-making is influenced by episodic memory, by using tools and theories from the above-mentioned fields, with the addition of computational modeling. Memory is essential to adaptive behavior, enabling organisms to draw on past experience to improve choices. Yet, the neural and cognitive mechanisms by which memory guides decision making are poorly understood. Despite substantial advances in understanding neural mechanisms of memory, on one hand, and those of decision making, on the other, remarkably little is known about a central adaptive aspect of memory function: how memory for the past is used to guide decisions. The proposed research aims to address this gap by bringing together three fields: psychology, neuroscience and economics. This NSF Fellow proposes a novel framework for beginning to understand how memory for specific episodes (""episodic memory"") is used to guide value-based decisions. Our overarching hypothesis is that many value-based decisions involve sampling evidence from memory to inform the decision. This team will test their hypothesis by integrating computational modeling with eyetracking and functional imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms by which episodic memory contributes to decision making. Determining the brain and cognitive mechanisms by which memory guides decisions will lay the foundation for potential future interventions which could radically shape policy. Poor decision making has been linked to poverty and aging with cascading effects on society more generally. The proposed results could help improve individual and collective decision making with clear implications for improving education and decision making across a diverse population.<br/><br/>Although it may seem obvious that many decisions are guided by memory, most studies on value-based decisions have focused on how repeated rewards incrementally form habitual decisions, which are distinct from pervasive more flexible and deliberative decisions that rely on episodic memory. This team's overall approach draws on advances in the neurobiological mechanisms of perceptual decision making. In perceptual decisions, such as deciding the direction of moving random dots, visual motion information is accumulated and when enough information is accumulated, a decision is made. This accumulation process is reflected in the firing rates of neurons in association and premotor cortices. Furthermore, the speed and accuracy of the decision are explained by a threshold (or bound) applied to the accumulation of information from the visual cortex. This team hypothesizes that a similar process accounts for how memories guide value-based decisions; in particular, we propose that sequential memory retrieval enters value based decisions in the same way that visual motion information is accumulated towards a perceptual decision. By linking memory, value and choice, this knowledge is expected to have important implications for multiple fields, including psychology, economics and neuroscience."

Low or zero thermal expansion is necessary when dimensional stability is important, such as in the fabrication of precision optical devices, and it is also highly beneficial in ceramics that are exposed to rapid changes in temperature, such as those used in cookware and in some engine and aerospace applications. Materials that shrink on heating (display negative thermal expansion) can be used to compensate for positive thermal expansion in other components. This research focuses on enhancing our fundamental understanding of the relationship between atomic structure and a material's properties, finding new compositions with interesting properties, developing chemical strategies for controlling thermal expansion, and using them to create infrared transparent zero thermal expansion materials. Such materials are potentially of value in thermal imaging, communications and laser applications. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the wide variety of synthetic and characterization techniques needed to prepare and understand the properties of these materials.

In early 2015, the team reported that calcium zirconium fluoride displays extremely strong negative thermal expansion over a wide temperature range. The family of materials which calcium zirconium fluoride belongs to has considerable compositional and structural flexibility. This provides for the control of thermal expansion by 1) cation substitutions, 2) cation disorder and 3) movement away from the ideal stoichiometry to form fluoride excess solids, which either have interstitial fluoride or cation vacancies. The control of thermal expansion by the deliberate generation of such structural defects is novel and potentially very powerful. Variable temperature / pressure neutron and x-ray scattering methods will be used to establish the links between atomic level structure and properties."

Such differences can be manipulated, eliminated or enhanced to improve desired properties and create better, more useful devices.  This work focuses on a class of magnetic thin films which are hoped to provide wide array of future applications in computing, electronics and even power generation. A strong collaboration of theory and experiment will benefit the quality of planned effort by providing a way to describe the observations theoretically and build models of observed variations of material properties as a function of depth. This project will support the education of PhD students in advanced vacuum deposition and theoretical and characterization techniques; a proven approach providing excellent training opportunities resulting in productive scientific careers in academic and technology settings. The expected increased physical understanding of magnetism and interfacial properties in thin films from these studies will be particularly relevant to technological applications which incorporate thin magnetic films, such as magnetic recording, spin generation, spin manipulation and/or spin detection. An improved understanding of surface and interface properties will allow smaller devices using less materials, higher energy efficiency and faster communication.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Magnetic and other properties at surfaces and interfaces are often different from the bulk, which can have significant impact on technologies relying on these properties. To develop enhanced interfaces and potentially new interfacial phenomena, strong competition is favorable. Strongly correlated oxides, with their competition between charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom offer many promising systems that may allow these tunable parameters. This project will study strongly correlated magnetic LaxSr1-xMnO3 (LSMO) thin films, which have been widely proposed for applications such as tunnel junctions and solid oxide fuel cells. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy and newly developed depth-dependent x-ray absorption analysis to model the magnetization and other properties with depth, the deviation of these parameters from bulk values at both the top and bottom interfacial layers of the thin film will be quantified. Improvements or degradation in the interfacial properties will be linked with the other measured parameters that vary in order to determine in collaboration with dynamical mean field theory the contribution from each factor. The project's focus on comparing the theoretical and experimental depth-dependent properties near surfaces and interfaces is expected to provide valuable insight into the properties of magnetic thin films and help answer questions about the primary contributing factors to the manifestations of magnetic properties at LSMO complex oxide surfaces and interfaces, the effect of adjustable strain on LSMO thin film properties, and general behaviors of interfacial properties in strongly correlated systems. These outcomes can be expected to allow optimization of both material choice and parameters for various magnetic applications such as computer memory, magnetic sensing and energy scavenging. The project will support the education of PhD students in advanced vacuum deposition, theoretical and characterization techniques, which have been proven to be excellent training for productive scientific careers in academic and technology settings."

It is important to obtain spatial-resolution of chemical information to order to understand natural systems and improve the efficiency of manufacturing (that is to see where impurities might be). Current imaging techniques, however, present several challenges. On the one hand, many techniques require several hours to tens of hours to obtain a surface element map with high resolution. On the other hand, current higher sample throughput techniques may not be widely accessible.  Some high throughput techniques require the use of synchrotron radiation facilities which are relatively rare. Professor Gamez is working on a glow discharge optical spectroscopic technique that could potentially map element distribution >1000x faster than typical techniques. As such, imaging protocols currently  limited by analysis time restrictions may become routine diagnostic tools. This research impacts many scientific research fields, from materials to biological sciences. The project also offers training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate researchers with regard to instrument development, fundamental studies, and application development in plasma-based optical hyperspectral imaging and surface analysis. Professor Gamez works with a number of local programs to recruit next generation STEM students, in particular those from underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>Glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) has been recently shown to enable spatially resolved lateral information to be obtained from within the sputtering surface area by operating the GD in pulsed-power and at higher pressures. These modes of operation become are important as it is no longer required to raster pixel-by-pixel to obtain a hyperspectral data cube with the elemental distribution information.  This savings may translates into several orders of magnitude faster analysis times. The overall goal of this project is to develop an ultrahigh throughput-, 3D-, large area surface chemical imaging technique based on GDOES. The three objectives are to: 1) develop hyperspectral imaging systems and novel GD instrumentation to enable GD 3D chemical imaging, 2) study the underlying GD mechanisms through OES and laser scattering plasma diagnostics, and 3) develop applications in materials, biological and geological sciences enabled by GDOES 3D chemical imaging. In addition to the overall goals, this research may improve comprehension of GD scaling, enhance the characterization of trends in molecular OES under GD conditions, and enable of a variety of imaging protocols in different fields."

The recent explosion of ""big data"" has raised several critical challenges in detecting cross-sample variation, which render existing methods inadequate and entail an urgent need for new methodologies. The most notable and prevalent challenges include complex distributional structures, the highly local nature of variation, various extraneous sources of variation, data sparsity, and massive computational demand. The overarching aim of this research project is to develop a general framework including theory, methods, algorithms, and software for effectively identifying variation in modern big data sets to address these challenges. <br/><br/>Specific inference problems to be addressed in this research project include: (i) identifying differences, especially highly local variations, across multiple data sets; (ii) separating intrinsic (i.e., scientifically interesting) cross-sample variation from extraneous variation; (iii) decomposing cross-sample variation into contributions from multiple sources; and (iv) identifying cross-sample variation and variance components in general random objects, including a variety of processes and functional observations. The use of multi-scale inference and Bayesian nonparametric modeling has led to development of a general probabilistic model-based framework for detecting cross-sample variation that integrates two powerful inference tactics -- multi-resolution scanning and graphical modeling. Multi-resolution scanning is the strategy of scanning through the sample space using windows of various sizes, carrying out testing or estimation for the structure of interest -- the cross-sample variation -- on each window. A class of graphical models is then designed to incorporate various dependency structures across scanning windows and data samples, thereby allowing borrowing strength among windows and related samples to achieve high statistical efficiency in identifying cross-sample variation. The project aims to construct a suite of computationally efficient and theoretically justifiable inferential methods and algorithms and to investigate their statistical properties."

However, efficiency of solar cells based on existing metal oxides is typically low due to poor material properties. In this project, researchers at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) are working on increasing the efficiency of metal oxides by theoretically predicting and experimentally synthesizing metal oxide materials with new compositions and enhanced properties. In addition, efficiency is enhanced by structuring these materials on the nanoscale level. These efforts are guided by terahertz spectroscopy measurements, which are used to understand relationships between the material composition, nanoscale structure and efficiency. The expected outcome of this SusChEM project is essential new knowledge for the development of sustainable thin-film solar cells composed of metal oxides capable of solar energy conversion with practical efficiencies. The project involves training and participation of graduate and undergraduate researchers. In addition, the WPI researchers are developing and delivering workshops and teaching modules on photovoltaics and nanotechnology for middle school girls and high school teachers from local districts serving large populations of low-income, minority and underrepresented students.

Metal oxides typically suffer from large band gaps or poor charge mobilities, or both, which has thus far restricted their solar-electricity efficiency. This project tackles these issues via three synergistic approaches: i) theoretically predicting and synthesizing new alloys of multi-metal oxides with improved band gaps and higher charge mobilities for solar energy conversion, ii) coating thin layers of these new oxides onto nanowire-array current-collectors to enhance their efficiency and iii) using terahertz spectroscopy to study the bulk carrier dynamics and interfacial charge transfer in these nanostructured oxides and further improve efficiency. This multi-pronged approach is the first to i) investigate new multi-metal oxide alloys that hold much promise for band engineering via alloying while still achieving relatively high mobility, ii) simultaneously apply 'extremely-thin-absorber' nanostructuring and interfacial engineering strategies to improve the charge collection efficiency of multi-metal oxide absorbers and iii) study the ultrafast carrier dynamics in thin metal oxide absorbers on a nanostructured current-collector, focusing on both bulk carrier dynamics and charge extraction at the absorber/current-collector interface."

Astrophysicists believe that twenty-five percent of the universe is composed of dark matter, but they don't know what dark matter is or where most of it resides. The guiding empirical hypothesis of this project is that some dark matter resides in dark galaxies; that is to say, in dark matter halos that either never possessed or have lost their ordinary matter at some time in the past. The project involves searching for these dark galaxies and studying the unique blend of observation, simulation, theory, and reasoning that allows astrophysicists to make such a discovery. It will provide a unique opportunity for a postdoctoral fellow to receive advanced training in philosophy and astrophysics at the highest levels; it is designed to fully engage the post-doctoral fellow in astrophysical work at the telescopes and with computers. In addition, astrophysicists will participate in a philosophical analysis of the scientific study. It is hoped that this intimate and intense interaction will push the boundaries of knowledge in astrophysics and at the same time demonstrate the unique richness inherent in a new sub-discipline, philosophy of astrophysics. The postdoc will spend three terms at the University of Pennsylvania, one term at the Carnegie Observatories, and she will be trained to use the Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas. The researchers will train and be assisted by undergraduate research assistants, who are to be recruited in part from programs targeting students from under-represented groups. Researchers on the project will give four public lectures on topics in the philosophy of astrophysics. In addition, the postdoc will develop a K-12 outreach kit that focuses on exciting topics in dark matter galaxy research and important new roles for citizen scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project focuses on the search for dark matter galaxies by bringing into joint consideration the simulations, observations, and database-combing required to find them, and the philosophical issues raised and illuminated by the search. The central philosophical issues are focused on the theme of epistemic warrant. For example, they will consider how imaging, spectroscopy, simulation, and theorizing combine to warrant inferences about objects that are millions of light-years away and are intrinsically invisible at all known frequencies. Another example is the use of simulations of dark-matter-galaxy/luminous-matter-galaxy interactions to determine their behavior. This will provide an opportunity to study the precise ways that theory enters into the construction of simulations, and how much theory determines values for simulation parameters. Philosophical questions include: What warrants importing these data into the luminous/dark-galaxy interactions? What considerations go into concluding simulations are precise and accurate, given that no one has ever knowingly observed the target event?"

Over the course of the last few decades, these methods have been extensively studied, and they have become fundamental to the practice of statistics - in large part because they can solve complex problems while relying on relatively few assumptions. Nevertheless, much remains to be understood about the performance of resampling methods in the context of modern data analysis, where observations tend to have large numbers of features (high-dimensional data), or where the quantity of data is so large that it outstrips computational resources (large-scale data). In both of these challenging settings, the proposed research will extend the applicability of resampling methods, and these efforts will be guided by two research themes discussed below.<br/><br/>First, in the setting of high-dimensional data, the understanding of inference problems, including tests and confidence intervals, remains underdeveloped in comparison with estimation and prediction problems. Given that resampling methods are a general-purpose approach to inference, it is important to know how they are influenced by the effects of low-dimensional structure and regularization. In particular, the proposed research will study the performance of resampling methods in high-dimensional models involving structured covariance matrices. Second, in the setting of large-scale data, randomized algorithms have received growing attention for their ability to produce fast approximate solutions. Although the outputs of such algorithms are random, their fluctuations can often be reduced at the expense of greater computation. This general trait of randomized algorithms leads to the problem of optimizing a tradeoff between precision and computational cost. Towards a solution, the proposed research will investigate how resampling methods can be used to measure this tradeoff for a collection of popular randomized algorithms."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world.  However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases.  Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models.

Recent advances in the fabrication of these materials have led to the development of new types of electronic devices.   For these extremely thin layers the quantum nature of the system dominates the properties in new and unusual ways.  In these materials spontaneous ordering, similar to ferromagnetism, can occur and the topology of the system can affect the properties.  However, these materials offer the advantage that electric fields can be used to modify the properties.  This leads to new possibilities for enhancing the functionality of quantum electronic devices. This project aims to develop a new, ultrasensitive capacitive technique to study these materials. The novel measurement toolkit, moreover, will aid other scientists in the field studying devices relevant to electronics and energy harvesting.

The technique relies on the small difference in geometric capacitance between a bilayer and two proximal gates caused by interlayer motion of electrons, detected using a multiplexed high current gain cryogenic amplifier. The proposed research will enhance understanding of the physics of graphene bilayers by exhaustively cataloging integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and symmetry protected edge states, using a combination of thermodynamic and charge transport techniques. In Bernal-stacked graphene bilayers, the Principal Investigator will directly resolve valley- and orbital-order in the zero energy Landau level, with additional work to detect thermodynamic anomalies associated with the still poorly understood zero magnetic field correlated phase. Layer polarization and polarizability measurements effected by measuring diverse capacitance observables in a dual gated device will allow unambiguous observation of interlayer coherent states and disambiguation of the charge-valley-orbital symmetry breaking mechanisms. In large twist angle graphene bilayers, bulk and edge probes will be used to search for quantum spin Hall effects of both normal and fractionalized electronic degrees of freedom. In small angle bilayers, the measurements will reveal the basic parameters of physical and electronic structure, specifically the role of elastic strain reconstructions when the layers are nearly aligned. At high magnetic fields bulk and edge measurements will permit disentanglement of intertwined ferromagnetic, fractional, and fractal quantum Hall physics."

The Earth is the source of all the minerals, metals and other natural resources required to manufacture the products needed to sustain a modern technological society. Exploration models designed to discover new occurrences of minerals and metals are based on an understanding of the various physical, chemical and biological processes that lead to the accumulation of metals and other resources into economic concentrations. Most mineral and metal deposits are formed when heated fluids in the Earth's crust dissolve, transport and deposit metals to form ore deposits, and most of the ore-forming fluids are highly-saline brines containing various salts. The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of the fundamental properties of saline fluids at temperature and pressure conditions appropriate for ore-forming systems. This information, in turn, will lead to development of better mineral exploration models and contribute to economic stability and prosperity and promote a more secure future by reducing dependence on external sources to provide the raw materials needed for technological and defense applications. The project will also provide training in state-of-the-art experimental and analytical techniques for several students and young researchers from diverse backgrounds. <br/><br/>Most natural saline fluids in the Earth's crust are approximated by the H2O-NaCl-KCl-CaCl2-FeCl2 system. Previous work has shown that the physical and chemical behavior of saline fluids at elevated temperatures and pressures is highly dependent on the total salinity of the fluid as well as the ratios of the various major salt components in the fluid. In this project experiments will be conducted to determine the Pressure-Volume-Temperature-Composition (PVTX) and phase equilibrium properties of aqueous chloride fluids at magmatic-hydrothermal PTX conditions. Synthetic fluid inclusions containing fluids with various binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary compositions within this five-component system will be trapped at magmatic-hydrothermal PTX conditions. Phase boundaries (liquid-vapor curves and liquidi), critical points, and isochores (lines of constant density) will be determined using the synthetic fluid inclusion technique that has proven to be successful in numerous earlier studies. Empirical numerical recipes to estimate compositions of fluids in the various sub-systems based on microthermometric and microanalysis of natural fluid inclusions will be developed from the experimental data. These data provide the basis for interpretations of microthermometric data from natural fluid inclusions and provide feedstock for future studies to develop empirical numerical models describing the PVTX properties of hydrothermal fluids over the range of PTX conditions appropriate for crustal hydrothermal systems. The results of this project will lead to a better understanding of the phase equilibrium and PVTX behavior of ?real? magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, and provide a solid basis for developing more robust mineral exploration models based on data obtained from studies of fluid inclusions in natural systems."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org."

Understanding why animal signals are so complex and how they evolved is a major research focus for scientists in many fields. Such research can add to our knowledge about how the senses work, how attention and learning shift perception, and how changing environments can impact communication (among others). In this project, scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Auburn University use a systems approach to study the evolution of courtship displays in a well-developed animal system. The team uses genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of more than 23 species. For each species, they also describe the communication system in detail and how it changes with environmental conditions. They then test hypotheses about system properties such as robustness and flexibility/evolvability. The project will advance our understanding of complex animal signals, and test long-standing theories from engineering and genomics about system structure and function. The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students. Research findings will also be integrated into a science exhibit that will be made available to the general public at natural history museums in Nebraska and Alabama. <br/><br/>Despite an appreciation of the prevalence and importance of complex signals in animal communication, progress towards an evolutionary analysis of signal complexity has been constrained by a lack of hypotheses and tools that can compare signaling systems across taxa and assess evolutionary and functional implications. This project develops and tests a novel theoretical and empirical paradigm by integrating a systems approach into animal communication research using Schizocosa wolf spiders. North American Schizocosa include 23 species that vary in their use of vibratory and visual courtship displays. Specific aims are (1) to assess the structure and dynamics of vibratory and visual courtship signals of each species in different environments; (2) to generate a robust phylogeny; and (3) to use phylogenetic comparative methods to test (i) the hypothesis that degeneracy facilitates robustness across changing conditions and (ii) whether degeneracy facilitates (or constrains) elaboration and signal divergence. The simultaneous measures of vibratory and visual signals across contexts combined with a robust phylogeny will enable unparalleled opportunities for evolutionary analyses of complexity. This research will facilitate an integrative and comprehensive understanding of the evolution, diversification, and maintenance of complex animal communication and provide a roadmap for similar studies across distinct taxa and signaling systems."

To become motile, cells must undergo radical changes in their composition and behavior, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT).  These radical changes arise as the network of genes controlling the state of the cell transitions from one type of stable fate to another. This project details a joint theory-experiment physics-biology effort to study how EMT is coordinated in space and time by chemical signals passed among the tumor cells.  The specific focus here is on the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway has been studied extensively for its role in developmental biology and has been implicated indirectly in cancer, but has never been studied systematically in this context. The hypothesis to be investigated is that this pathway can allow the formation of small clusters of cells that have undergone EMT together, and which thereafter travel as a collective en route to the establishment of a secondary tumor. If proven to be true, these ideas will shed light on the fundamental origins of metastasis and might in the future offer new strategies for both prognosis and treatment.<br/> <br/>Cell-cell interactions, both between tumor cells proper and between tumor and stromal cells, are known to be a key component of many solid tumors. The investigators will focus on how one of these interactions, that mediated by the Notch pathway, can coordinate cell phenotypes and can thereby control tumor progression. To accomplish this will require the use and extension of sophisticated theory techniques from the field of non-equilibrium pattern formation coupled to an experimental plan focused on pancreatic cancer cell lines to be studied in both 2d and 3d in vitro conditions, both without and with supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts. Of particular importance will be measuring spatial correlations of EMT state (and other known correlates) and comparing these to expectations based on different signaling assumptions. Iterating these experiments with increasingly realistic model-building and model-solving will allow for the creation of a quantitatively reliable picture for the collective behavior of the tumor, going well-beyond current individual cell approaches.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division at NSF."

These proofs must be efficiently verifiable in less time and energy than it takes to re-execute the computation itself.<br/><br/>Building upon exciting recent theoretical and practical advances in verifiable outsourced computation for the cloud, this project develops new techniques that exploit the unique constraints and adversary models that relate to the verifiable hardware problem. In addition, the project also develops new practical approaches to the problem of general verifiable computation. As a broader impact, computing systems security is one of the greatest technological problems faced by society today. Verifiable hardware is an essential foundation for building future computing systems that are reliable and free from catastrophic security failures. The ultimate goal of this project is to make verifiable hardware practical and accessible for use in cryptographic and mission-critical hardware applications through open-source tools.

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

This research project aims to resolve an apparent contradiction in human color perception. When a human observer is asked to detect a colored target that is barely visible, the visual system sums color signals across space to achieve maximum sensitivity to the weak stimulus. However, when one views a highly-colored scene, the visual system takes the difference between color signals at different locations, leading to color appearance that is highly dependent on contrasts in color. The apparent contradiction between adding and subtracting can be resolved by the hypothesis that color perception adds color signals at threshold, when they are barely visible, but subtracts color signals when color stimuli are well above threshold. This research tests this hypothesis by studying how color perception depends on the pattern of the color in space. Spacing has different effects on color perception if the visual system is adding or subtracting color signals. Better understanding of how the visual system processes color may translate to advances in fields such as lighting design or color graphics. The project involves training of young scientists in methods of studying human vision through measuring behavior and brain activity, as well as science outreach to public school students.<br/><br/>The experiments will measure the spatial pattern dependence of suprathreshold color perception in humans and compare suprathreshold results with those at color threshold. Two different techniques for studying suprathreshold color perception are used: hue and saturation scaling, and reaction times. The project also includes measurements of the human cVEP (color-Visual Evoked Potential, an EEG measure of color responses in early visual cortex) and its dependence on spatial stimulus variables at different levels of color contrast. The aim of the cVEP experiments is to determine the cortical mechanisms that are the basis of color perception near threshold and suprathreshold. A computational model will be used to fit the psychophysics and cVEP data."

Weaving together strands of psychology, neuroscience, economics, and education, researchers at Wesleyan University and Boston College shed light on the cognitive processes underlying our abilities to estimate 4 kinds of quantities: number, space, time, and probability. By comparing processes across these four distinct areas, the researchers aim to provide a unifying account of how children and adults estimate quantities, which has the potential to transform current understanding of the cognitive bases of how people learn in and across STEM disciplines. Achieving a simple unifying account is important because the ability to think well about quantity in all of these areas is fundamental to STEM learning. Other educational benefits include the establishment of partnerships with local museums that allow the research team to collect data from a diverse population while also supporting the museum's public education efforts. This project also contributes to STEM workforce development by training undergraduate students through a service-learning course offered at Wesleyan, and through a summer research internship exchange across the two universities. These aspects of the project, taken with its robust theoretical grounding, well-formulated research questions and tests of competing models of how people reason about quantity in childhood and adulthood, demonstrate its potential to guide and improve the design of STEM learning environments for all citizens.<br/><br/>This project exemplifies the Education and Human Resources Core Research program's commitment to fundamental research on learning in STEM that combines theory, techniques, and perspectives from a wide range of disciplines and contexts.  Specifically, it aims to provide a unifying account of how children and adults estimate quantities across four distinct domains: the development of numerical estimation; spatial categorization (remembering the location of items in space); the theoretical neuroscience of time processing (reproducing temporal durations); and decision making under risk (the processing of probabilities). Through a series of behavioral studies with adults and children, the researchers will test their hypothesis that proportion judgment underlies basic quantity estimation across these domains, across development, and across contexts (varying task constraints). This work is important because -- despite striking similarities in behaviors described across research in these literatures -- each one conceptualizes them quite differently, positing different accounts of the underlying mechanisms that yield quantity judgments. The project will advance and potentially transform our understanding of mental representations and processes involved in quantity judgments while also providing insight into how quantity biases may influence the processing of numerical information in educational contexts and real-life decisions. In this way the project builds a coherent, cumulative knowledge base, focusing on high-leverage topics."

Galactic winds are a key component of this exchange of matter and energy.  This project aims to study the initiation and propagation of galactic winds with particular focus on the role of particles moving at speeds near the speed of light.  Such particles are known as cosmic rays.  (In fact, such cosmic rays from our own Milky Way Galaxy interact with each of us every day!)  The major outcome of this project will be improved and extended models of galactic winds (1) that build insight into the nature of galactic winds, (2) that can be used by astronomers to connect galaxy and cosmic ray properties with wind properties, and (3) that can be adapted to advanced computer simulations of how galaxies form and change throughout their lifetimes.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training graduate and undergraduate students in plasma and computational physics and by using the project results to develop teaching materials for university courses.  In addition, the investigators will develop a new public outreach program, ""The Sun in the Park,"" that will offer solar viewing and participatory exercises in urban parks in Madison and Milwaukee.<br/><br/>More technically, winds are detected from galaxies of many types.  Simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have shown that star formation must be limited by feedback processes and that galactic winds driven by stellar energy and momentum output may be a key part of this feedback.  Radio and gamma-ray probes of cosmic rays in a variety of galactic environments have greatly extended our knowledge of cosmic ray properties and those of the underlying galaxies.  Although cosmic rays account for a small fraction of the energy output from stars, they have an outsized role in driving galactic winds through their high mobility, long cooling times, and strong coupling to the background through plasma waves.  This project will investigate the basis for this coupling in a variety of interstellar environments.  This part of the work will address whether cosmic rays couple efficiently to both fully and weakly ionized outflows, how small scale interstellar turbulence affects momentum and energy transfer, and how extreme conditions including high gas densities and weak magnetic fields affect the coupling.  The investigators will create a versatile grid of outflow models based on a small number of parameters to aid in interpreting observations of winds and implementing them in galaxy simulations.  They will use this work as a basis for improved treatments of cosmic rays in collaborative advanced numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution."

However, software errors are common, routinely cause security breaches, and cost our economy billions of dollars annually. Despite the well-known high costs of software errors, the software industry struggles to overcome this challenge, as new errors are reported faster than they can be fixed. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of automated program repair techniques to address this challenge.   In this research, we develop new techniques to fix software errors and implement new features automatically. The challenge is to fix code while not breaking other functionality, and to work toward repairing code of increasing complexity.<br/><br/>The approach takes advantage of the high availability of open-source code that already implements many functions required for a new software project. The approach is to search for relevant code in open-source projects, adapt that code to its new context using automated software repair and generation techniques, and then validate the changed software. A key component of the approach is semantic code search, which queries large databases of code to find code snippets that satisfy a behavioral specification. The project develops novel techniques that (1) encode large, searchable bodies of code as behavioral profiles, (2) localize bugs and features to code blocks, modules, and components, (3) extract the desired behavioral profiles of those blocks, modules, and components, (4) use the extracted profiles to search the database for potential patches, (5) adapt the potential patches to fit into the code context, and (6) validate the potential patches. The project focuses on producing high-quality code, verifying that the injected code does not break existing functionality.  The broader impacts come mainly from goal of radically improving software productivity through reuse and adaptation of existing code."

The proposed work will attempt measuring them using a technique that is expected to yield very high sensitivity in biological samples.<br/><br/>MicroRNAs (miRs) are single-stranded RNAs, capable of regulating genomic processes. Their measurement is useful in disease diagnosis, including cancer. Thus circulating miRs have the potential to serve as diagnostic markers. The current state-of-the-art miR assay is by qRT-PCR, requiring reverse transcription, labeling and amplification. Preliminary studies suggest that hybridizing miR to single-strand DNA (ssDNA) that is attached to gold nanoprisms (GNPs) may induce a novel transduction mechanism via delocalization of conduction electrons. This electronic effect can be investigated utilizing localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of GNPs bound to solid substrates. It is found that GNPs undergo a large LSPR wavelength shift upon ssDNA/miR hybridization, and is thought to be due to electronic delocalization, and is an unexplored methodology for analyzing miRs in biological fluids. Further, there is a potential to develop this new methodology into a label-free, low cost multiplexing array. This proposal seeks to validate the electronic delocalization hypothesis by investigating spacing/electronic conjugation between ssDNA and the GNP surface, a single mismatch at different positions in ssDNA/miR helix, chemical functionality attached to ssDNA, and number of nucleotides in miR strands, for structural characterization of the LSPR-based sensors. The proposed research will result in LSPR-based miR sensors capable of assaying at ultralow concentrations in biofluids (Objective 1) via UV-visible spectrometry by monitoring changes in the LSPR peak. To achieve multiplexing capability, portability and long-term stability, GNPs will be immobilized at the bottom of plastic multiwall plates. In this way, each well can be treated as an independent miR sensor (Objective 2). It is expected that assay of 50 distinct miRs excluding positive and negative controls directly from biofluids using a single 96-well plate, and will be characterized in absorption mode by a standard plate reader. Such a design is expected to impact both biomedical research and medical diagnostics.

A common prerequisite for these two quantum phenomena is strong spin-orbit coupling, either intrinsic or the Rashba type. Of the two phenomena, QAHE requires additional exchange interaction or ferromagnetism in graphene. Although native graphene has neither interaction, its open and flexible structure allows modifications of the properties by proximity coupling to other materials.  The proposed quantum phenomena based on quantized anomalous Hall effect can be potentially used for dense, robust, low-power, and scalable non-volatile memory which will drastically improve the performance of the current memory devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions. The non-volatile memory devices are ubiquitous in the modern society. High-performance memory devices based on quantum spintronic phenomena will have a significant impact on low power memory. PI proposes to train the undergraduate and graduate students, especially the underrepresented minority students by engaging them with research projects and teaching them newly developed elective courses. The also PI plans to continue outreach activities to a STEM school by coaching the Science Olympiad events  to STEM High school students as well as giving lectures to the summer Physics teachers from southern California high schools during Physics Teacher Summer Academy sponsored by the Physics Department. <br/><br/>PI's group has successfully demonstrated the anomalous Hall effect in graphene via the proximity coupling with a magnetic insulator.  More recently, PI's group also demonstrated a strong enhancement of spin-orbit coupling via the proximity effect with a transition metal dichalcogenide material (e.g. WS2). In this work, the PI aims to explore the induced effects in all-proximity coupled graphene devices, which acquire new interactions for realizing the predicted quantum effects at relatively high temperatures. Currently few materials are predicted and even fewer materials have been experimentally shown to exhibit QSHE (e.g. HgTe/CdTe quantum wells) and QAHE (e.g. magnetic topological insulators).  These materials are extremely difficult to be synthesized or only show the desired properties at extremely low temperatures. The proposed graphene-based devices are ideal systems in which the required interactions can be induced by proximity effects. Those quantum phenomena have not yet been explored in graphene, but it I expected to show many novel and interesting properties, such as quantized transport, robust Hall voltages, pure spin current, etc. These unmatched properties, if demonstrated at high temperatures, can potentially revolutionize the present-day spin electronics. In this proposed research, the PI plans to demonstrate a prototype quantum spintronic memory device based on QAHE.  The knowledge learned in the graphene-based devices will deepen our fundamental understanding of two-dimensional electron systems with tunable interactions."

Removing this heat has become an increasing challenge.  This is particularly important as the trend for both more and smaller transistors on a chip continues.  The Principal Investigator has developed a new thermometry technique that allows the temperature of these nanoscale devices to be measured.  Fahrenheit's original mercury-in-glass thermometer inferred temperature from the density changes of mercury.  This technique does essentially the same thing at the nanoscale.  It infers temperature changes from the density of the materials on the chip.  The research team will use this new technique to study how heat flows in wires and at interfaces.  The students involved in this project will receive training in state-of-the-art nanofabrication and microcopy techniques.<br/> <br/>Technical abstract<br/>In this project a new thermometry technique will be applied to the study of heat transport at very small length scales, which is both poorly understood and extremely relevant to modern electronics.   The technique, plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET), involves measuring a material's density very accurately, and then inferring the corresponding temperature using knowledge of the material's thermal expansion.  This approach is based on the same principle as Fahrenheit's original mercury-in-glass thermometer, which also infers temperature from density changes.   The key advance is that here the density can be mapped with nanoscale spatial resolution, which allows the technique to produce temperature maps with unprecedented resolution.  The density is determined by measuring the material's bulk plasmon energy using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).  As part of their training, students will fabricate simple microelectronic devices.  Then, using the electron microscope, they will map the temperatures that result from electrically activating the devices. By imaging the thermal gradients that result from the electrical currents, it will be possible to directly connect atomic-scale structures and interfaces to the effect they have on heat generation and transport."

The attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole can cause the two particles to stick together.  This bound electron-hole pair is called an exciton.  In a new class of atomically thin semiconductors, excitons are extraordinarily stable, even at room temperature.  The research team aims to understand, using both experiment and theory, the behavior of excitons in black phosphorus, and to find out whether it will be possible to construct potentially transformative optoelectronic devices using excitons in this class of materials.  In particular, double layer black phosphorus (two atomically thin layers separated by an insulating spacer) provides a compelling combination of properties for the exploration of excitons, including longer exciton lifetimes and vertical orientation of the positive and negative charges making up the exciton.  Both of these properties, combined with the relatively high electrical conductivity of black phosphorus, will promote both the fundamental study and device applications of excitons in this material.  This research activity provides mentoring and training of a widely inclusive group of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Outreach activities focus on encouraging the enrollment of underrepresented groups at the University of Arkansas.<br/><br/>Technical description: Absent screening by a 3D bulk, 2D materials generate strong Coulomb interactions and therefore host excitons at high temperatures.  This project aims to characterize and understand the basic properties of excitons in pristine, encapsulated, few-layer black phosphorus.  Given sufficient carrier mobility and exciton lifetimes, it is possible to create excitonic devices that transport excitons from one part of a circuit to another.  This movement of excitons could be used to encode and transmit information, or it could be used to modulate optical signals in a nanoscale structure.  In particular, double layer black phosphorus (two atomically thin layers separated by a dielectric spacer) provides a compelling combination of properties for the exploration of excitons, including enhanced lifetimes, relatively high and anisotropic mobility, and vertically-aligned dipoles that promote control of exciton motion by non-uniform electric fields.  The research team measures and analyzes exciton energies, linewidths, positions, and lifetimes as a function of black phosphorus thickness, temperature, and charge density (both electrons and holes) to provide baseline material properties of pristine black phosphorus. This information provides input to effective theoretical models, which guides the creation and understanding of excitonic devices in which excitons are controlled by gates voltages."

For certain conditions, the droplets line up to form chains of drops that persist and sometimes coalesce to form thin liquid strands.  Chain formation is only observed for confined emulsions of deformable drops.  The investigators hypothesize that small changes in the flow, caused by the deformable drops, induce the drops to align in chains.  The hypothesis will be tested by carrying out numerical simulations that solve the equations governing the deformation of the drops and their motion in confined flows.  By varying material parameters, the investigators can gradually increase the extent of drop deformation, which should be correlated with the degree of chain formation.  The research team will collaborate with a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology who first observed the chaining phenomenon experimentally.  Additional experiments will be carried out to compare data with the computer simulations developed in this project. The team expects that understanding the microscale flow patterns leading to drop alignment can be harnessed to make new microstructured materials.  The researchers will engage local high school students in Yale's Pathway to Science Program by teaching students to write simple computer programs that simulate motions of particles in fluids.  They will also develop activities for fifth through eleventh grade girls attending a residential summer camp at Texas Tech called ""Science: It's a Girl Thing.""<br/><br/>The project will verify the hypothesis that quadrupolar flow-field patterns produced by deformable immiscible drops in a strongly confined shear flow are responsible for the formation of ordered structures in confined emulsions.  A hierarchy of many-particle, computer simulation algorithms will be developed to identify key flow patterns that guide particles into ordered microstructures.  Particle-scale phenomena responsible for the formation of microstructures will be determined by analyzing simulation results and comparing them with experiments under highly controlled conditions.  Although the project will focus on emulsions of deformable drops, the project?s results will apply to spontaneous ordering in other systems with nonlinear particle interactions, such as suspensions of rigid particles in non-Newtonian fluids.

A series of recently discovered materials have competing stable phases with different crystallographic structures and can be reproducibly and rapidly transformed between phases. These structural phases differ significantly in their properties; new functionality in electronic and optical devices is enabled by switching between phases. At present, the detailed structural mechanism of these phase transformations, including the motion of the boundaries between phases, is not clear. This project comprises a series of experimental studies designed to probe the dynamics of this phase transformation, to answer key questions about the physical mechanism involved, and ultimately to provide feedback to the design of improved electroceramics.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The single-phase complex oxide bismuth ferrite, a prototypical multiferroic complex oxide, can be reproducibly transformed between structural phases with different symmetries, optical properties, and magnetic structures. Prof. Evans focuses on this model system because bismuth ferrite can be reliably synthesized using epitaxial growth techniques (e.g., ion sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and chemical vapor deposition) such that it is near a phase boundary where phase transitions can be utilized in electromechanical, optoelectronic, and magnetic devices. Evans's initial results show that bismuth ferrite can be reproducibly transformed between structural phases on timescales as short as tens of nanoseconds, but these studies do not have sufficient time resolution to probe the fundamental timescale of the transformation. Through this project, Evans will (1) determine the short-time dynamics of rhombohedral behaviour (R-like) and tetragonal behaviour (T-like) phase populations in bismuth ferrite using picosecond-scale optical excitation and few-nanosecond-resolution electric field pulses, (2) probe the strain distribution and structure of individual R-like/T-like phase interfaces using X-ray nanobeam diffraction, (3) study the structure and dynamics of individual R-like/T-like interfaces in applied electric fields to determine the difference in dynamics arising from differing interface structures, and (4) explore the extension of these concepts to the interface dynamics in related phase-transforming complex oxides. Evans's work uses emerging synchrotron X-ray nanodiffraction methods, including recent advances in the analysis of diffraction patterns acquired with highly convergent coherent X-ray beams. This project supports the professional preparation of graduate students, participation of undergraduate students in research, targeted outreach through the development and demonstration of educational activities, and the dissemination of materials characterization and X-ray nanobeam diffraction methods to the broader research community."

Mechanism design deals with economic systems from the viewpoint of an optimizing designer: the designer would like to design a system or protocol whereby the selfish optimization of individual participants leads to a desirable aggregate behavior. In the context of resource allocation, for example, mechanism design theory specifies how a seller or owner of resources should allocate these resources to buyers so as to achieve the maximum possible revenue or economic efficiency. However, optimal mechanisms prescribed by the theory are often hard to compute, complex to implement, and over-sensitive to fine details of the input. These challenges are exacerbated in settings that are combinatorial, dynamic or online (as opposed to one-shot), or involve informational dependencies among different buyers. The PI will investigate solution concepts that are simultaneously near-optimal as well as practical; this would bring the theory of mechanism design closer to practice. Over the last decade new electronic marketplaces-for example, cloud platforms, platforms for a sharing economy, and digital goods stores-have arisen in a largely ad hoc manner. This project aims to establish strong theoretical underpinnings for the design of such marketplaces, thereby guiding the next wave of development in this area.<br/><br/>The project will address applications such as allocation of cloud services, as well as resource allocation in dynamic settings where buyers repeatedly request resources (e.g. digital goods such as music, apps, and games), and their value for a resource varies stochastically over time. One challenge in these contexts is that buyers may strategize about how their current actions affect their future payoffs and the mechanism designer must take such strategizing into account. Another challenge is in dealing with the combinatorial nature of resource requests owing to the multiple kinds of resources available (e.g., CPU, storage). This project will employ pricing-based mechanisms as a solution concept that simultaneously achieves near-optimality, simplicity, detail-freeness, and robustness to noise in the input."

However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo.  Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow.  They will deduce the properties of destroyed ""dwarf"" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.  This will give insight into the properties of dwarf galaxies that did not survive until the present day. This program will train young astronomers and introduce high school students to scientific research.<br/><br/>The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to our own. It is similar in many ways to our Milky Way galaxy, but shows evidence that it has merged with more small galaxies than the Milky Way.  The investigators, along with students, will use an archive of Keck telescope spectra from previous observations of tens of thousands of stars, and will also perform new spectroscopic observations.  They will use the spectra to measure the abundances of atomic elements and track the properties of the chemical environment in which the stars formed.  The investigators will perform the first large-scale chemical abundance study of Andromeda's stellar halo.<br/><br/>The investigators will recruit students to engage in summer research related to this program.  They will focus their recruitment at schools that have a large fraction of students from demographic groups that are under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

This SusChEM project involves computational research on the conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuel as a sustainable energy source and a sustainable feedstock for new materials. Biofuel derived from perennial plants, such as grass, is most desirable since these plants grow on marginal land and can be harvested repeatedly. One major roadblock for economical utilization of plant biomass is the resistance of cellulosic fibrils to pretreatment to facilitate their conversion to usable fuels. Many questions regarding the detailed structures of fibrils and their interactions with water, other chemical solvents, and enzymes are poorly understood. The team will use high quality quantum mechanical computer simulations to develop accurate computational models to describe these interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving the efficiency of biomass conversion and for applications for the discovery and modeling of cellulose-based materials.<br/><br/>The research team will engage undergraduate and graduate students in sustainability research which aims to find solutions to enable the balance of carbon emission with carbon sequestration. Students will have the opportunity to visit Oak Ridge National Laboratory and experience research in a government laboratory. The team will develop a self-contained computational chemistry USB memory stick with packages to perform electronic structure and other modeling.  The computer programs contained will include many that can be used without a detailed knowledge of molecular quantum mechanics.

Through this SusChEM project, the research team will develop a multiscale model for cellulose fibrils and investigate fundamental properties of fibrils and fiber bundles with application to sustainable energy and the discovery of sustainable cellulose-based materials. <br/><br/>The research team will develop an accurate potential for cellulose by fitting to accurate electronic structure forces using the adaptive force matching method. Through an iterative procedure, adaptive force matching provides both high quality reference forces and representative training sets for fitting. This allows accurate force fields to be developed without using very complex energy expressions. As a consequence, larger structures can be modeled efficiently.<br/> <br/>Once the adaptive force matching cellulose force field is available, an accurate coarse-grained potential will be developed using the multiscale coarse-graining approach. The coarse-grained potential will allow long cellulose fibrils and fibril bundles to be modeled. <br/>The cellulose potential will be developed with only electronic structure information as input. The model will be validated to reproduce experimental properties, such as lattice constants and rotamer distributions.  The validated all-atom and coarse-grained potentials will be used to address fundamental problems of cellulosic fibrils, including the number of chains in a fibril, the tendency for twisting, rotamer conformations at the interface, free energy of polymorph transformations, and the persistence length of the fibril.  <br/>The accurate multiscale potentials to be developed will enable reliable modeling of hydrated cellulosic fibrils, and further research in modeling cellulosic biomass and cellulose-based materials. The cellulose force field will be a stepping stone for the developments of additional models that involve alternative solvents, such as ionic liquids, and enzymes. <br/><br/>Successful development of an accurate cellulose potential will represent a major advance of adaptive force matching. The development of adaptive force matching into a reliable protocol for mapping an expensive electronic structure potential to a simple molecular mechanics force field will have broad impact for material research in general. <br/><br/>This award also supports educational activities to integrate computational modeling into Chemistry education. A self-contained computational chemistry USB memory stick will be developed to facilitate computer modeling by undergraduate students and the use of computer modeling in classrooms. No installation or licensing is needed, allowing the user to focus on the problem instead of computational details. The PI will disseminate the USB memory stick to regional colleges and help the faculty incorporate modeling in their classrooms. The PI will also develop modeling modules and tutorials to teach important concepts in physical and organic chemistry. The PIs will engage undergraduate and graduate students in carbon neutral sustainability research and provide them with the opportunity to visit Oak Ridge National Laboratory and experience research in a national laboratory."

In the geometric setting it is to show that such sets contain a translated and rotated copy of a given finite set, or of its sufficiently large dilates. In other words it is to study the occurrence of geometric patterns. Over the past fifteen years there has been a remarkable progress of the study of linear patterns, developing and introducing tools from mathematical analysis, often referred to as higher-order Fourier analysis. Among the major achievements is the celebrated result of Green and Tao, which states that there are arbitrary long sequences of equally spaced prime numbers. This project builds on this development, and one of its major objectives is to develop analytic tools to understand the occurrence of geometric and arithmetic (i.e., defined by equations) structures in large but otherwise arbitrary sets. The problems arise in the context of the prime and integer lattice and also in classical Euclidean spaces. The principal investigator's approaches involve the interplay of techniques from discrete harmonic analysis and number theory, in addition to a new ingredient, ideas from additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>The first motivational context for the project is that of prime numbers: to study nonlinear relations among the primes and to investigate the related problem of finding geometric constellations among points with prime coordinates. The underlying philosophy of considering the primes as a random subset of the integers leads naturally to the study of analogous questions in large sets of integer points and also in large measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces. Geometric structures in such sets are not well understood.  The project aims to develop a general approach based on the modern point of view of additive combinatorics; namely, to establish appropriate notions of randomness that control the frequency at which a certain pattern occurs and to prove structure theorems for sets that are not suitably random. The underlying constructs are analytic and are related to objects studied in discrete harmonic analysis such as maximal operators and Radon transforms acting on functions defined on the integer lattice. Finally, the project aims to study geometric patterns in large measurable subsets of Euclidean spaces from this novel point of view, strengthening the connections between additive combinatorics and classical harmonic analysis."

Such a compass works because its tiny magnetic needle aligns with the magnetic field of Earth and indicates the direction of North.  On scales much larger than Earth, our own Milky Way Galaxy also has its own magnetic field.  In fact, all galaxies in the Universe appear to have magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields can have profound effects on a galaxy's development throughout its lifetime.  Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.  Such a result could have a profound influence on our current understanding of fundamental physics, and its pursuit serves the national interest of developing US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training undergraduate and graduate students in general and computational astrophysics.  Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.<br/><br/>More technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources."

The eclipse observations are unique because they provide a rare opportunity to discover new types of solar phenomena that may be linked to the solar cycle and space weather.  The project's high-resolution studies of flaring and active regions at long radio wavelengths should provide information that is potentially useful for space weather predictions.  Studies of the solar corona at eclipses have been a major part of the success of the Williams College department in attracting and training students. Undergraduate students, increasingly including members of underrepresented groups through Williams' need-blind admissions policy, have been intimately connected with the eclipse expeditions in the past and the associated data reduction and analysis. This project would enable the active involvement and training of students at the Williams College to continue.  Furthermore, since total solar eclipses are of widespread public interest in the countries from which they are visible, they provide an excellent opportunity for public education in the United States about astronomy in general.  Therefore, this project directly supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.  <br/><br/>This 3-year project is to take advantage of the 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse, especially to observe the white-light corona and work with highly processed images that bring out detail and extreme contrast, allowing improved measurements of dynamics of coronal plumes and other coronal features, especially coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and to observe the green-line (Fe XIV), and red-line (Fe X) coronas to contrast regions of different temperatures.  The solar observations include exquisitely high resolution observations with a Fabry-Perot.  Also, high-frequency (>1 Hz) power spectra of coronal loops will be used to compare mechanisms of coronal heating.  Spectrographic observations will allow the project team to investigate changes of the spectral-line ratios over the solar-activity cycle as the cycle, now past a low maximum, declines toward.

The goal of this project is to define for the first time how the mechanical signals arising from physical activity, which are the primary regulator of bone cell function and remodeling, regulate the bone metastatic cells that are exposed to the same signals.  This will be accomplished by pursuing three objectives: 1) Building a tissue-level multi-physics computational model of mechanical loading in a 3D bone mimetic scaffold. 2) Determining the cellular strains resulting from interactions between bone metastatic breast cancer cells and fluid flow and 3) defining a data-driven relationship between cellular strains and bone metastatic breast cancer cell osteolytic phenotype. The results will transform fundamental understanding of how tumor cells are regulated in the skeletal microenvironment with considerable potential to improve clinical management of the disease. Educational Impact will be achieved through increased educational opportunities in bioengineering at the undergraduate level, engage middle and high school underrepresented populations in bioengineering research at UMass, and active recruitment of graduate students from underrepresented groups to broaden participation in the field of bioengineering.

After metastasis occurs, patient prognosis dramatically declines due to severe skeletal-related complications, including bone destruction (?osteolysis?). Mechanical signals arising from physical activity are the primary regulator of bone cell function and remodeling, and bone metastatic cells are also exposed to these signals; however, their role in metastasis in unclear because they are often ignored in studies of metastatic bone disease. Using breast cancer as our example case, our preliminary data shows that compression of bone metastatic tumor cells in a 3D bone mimetic scaffold altered their expression of genes that modify bone remodeling, supporting our hypothesis that skeletal mechanical signals are a fundamental regulator of tumor cell behavior. Here, we seek to systematically define the functional relationship between mechanical signals and bone metastatic cell function through development of an integrated in vitro 3D experimental and multi-physics, multi-scale computational platform. This project will benefit from collaboration between experts in engineered systems of in vitro loading and cancer biology as well as computational fluid-structure modeling. The Research Plan is presented as three objectives:  1) Build a tissue-level multi-physics computational model of mechanical loading in our 3D bone mimetic scaffold. Method: This objective will generate a ""tissue-level"" computational model including Finite Element and Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis to determine the internal stresses and strains of our bone scaffold undergoing compression and perfusion. MicroCT images of the scaffold will be converted to a discretized model, and estimated values of the induced flow velocities and the extracellular matrix strain within the scaffold will be calculated based on a one-way coupling method; 2) Determine the cellular strains resulting from interactions between bone metastatic breast cancer cells and fluid flow. Method: This objective will create a ""cell-level"" computational model of cellular deformations. The estimated values of internal flow velocity and tractions from Objective 1 are utilized as the boundary conditions for a fully-coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction algorithm, which will be used to model the interaction between the inter-scaffold fluid flow and cancer cells; 3) Define a data-driven relationship between cellular strains and bone metastatic breast cancer cell osteolytic phenotype. Method: This objective will result in a data-driven mechano-regulatory algorithm for bone metastatic breast cancer cells. First, the cellular response of tumor cells, cultured in our bone scaffold, under a range of imposed mechanical loading environments will be measured via expression of osteolytic genes. These results will be mathematically correlated to the cellular deformations from Objective 2 using multivariate statistical analysis.  The results of this project will transform our fundamental understanding of how tumor cells are regulated in the skeletal microenvironment with considerable potential to improve clinical management of the disease. The data collected from these studies will form the foundation for defining the role of mechanical stimulation during bone metastasis.  Educational Impact will be achieved through increased educational opportunities in bioengineering at the undergraduate level, engage middle and high school underrepresented populations in bioengineering research at UMass, and active recruitment of graduate students from underrepresented groups to broaden participation in the field of bioengineering."

Existing solutions to this problem are either based on legal and contractual obligations, or use post-fabrication IC testing, both of which are unsatisfactory or unsound. As a sound alternative, this project designs and fabricates verifiable hardware: ICs that provide proofs of their correctness for every input-output computation they perform in the field. These proofs must be efficiently verifiable in less time and energy than it takes to re-execute the computation itself.<br/><br/>Building upon exciting recent theoretical and practical advances in verifiable outsourced computation for the cloud, this project develops new techniques that exploit the unique constraints and adversary models that relate to the verifiable hardware problem. In addition, the project also develops new practical approaches to the problem of general verifiable computation. As a broader impact, computing systems security is one of the greatest technological problems faced by society today. Verifiable hardware is an essential foundation for building future computing systems that are reliable and free from catastrophic security failures. The ultimate goal of this project is to make verifiable hardware practical and accessible for use in cryptographic and mission-critical hardware applications through open-source tools.

They have the potential to do significant damage to satellites, power grids, and humans in space.  CMEs change in significant ways as they propagate through the interplanetary medium.  There are only a few locations between the Sun and the Earth where measurements of the ICMEs (Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections) have been made.  As such, this 3-year SHINE project is potentially transformative as it plans to use data and models to examine ICMEs that hit Mercury and Earth.  The goals are to determine how their properties evolve, how solar wind interactions change them, and what critical factors affect the direction of the magnetic field in them.  This last point is particularly important as the direction of the field when it hits Earth plays a very large role in the effect that the CME has on electric and telecommunications systems.  The outcomes of this study have the potential to vastly improve the science behind prediction models used in space hazard early warning systems. <br/><br/>The main goal of this SHINE project is to develop the physical understanding of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) propagation and evolution in the inner heliosphere inside 1 AU.  To accomplish this goal, the project will use multi-spacecraft observations of the same ICME events at Mercury (MESSENGER) and at 1 AU (ACE, WIND, STEREO), in conjunction with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of these events to focus on ICME magnetic field (strength and direction), speed, and shock structure evolution from 0.3 AU to 1 AU.  The main efforts of the analyses include force-free field fitting of the magnetic ejecta to determine the flux rope orientation and axial magnetic field strength at Mercury and at 1 AU, ICME shock shape determination at both distances, solar wind velocity estimation at Mercury (from proxies as well as models), and MHD simulations of real ICME events in order to discern global structure and changes during propagation.  MESSENGER has now amassed a large dataset of ICMEs from years of observations at Mercury's heliocentric distances, and so this project is very timely and will lay the groundwork in mapping ICME evolution in preparation for the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions.  The three key scientific questions addressed in this project are: (1) how do ICME properties (e.g., magnetic field, speed, shock structure) evolve from Mercury to 1 AU; (2) does the global magnetic field structure inside ejecta change significantly on average from Mercury to 1 AU; and, (3) what are the critical factors that affect change in flux rope orientation during propagation?<br/><br/><br/>The project is highly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, and it will have a strong impact on the SHINE community.  SHINE and the broader scientific community will be served through the following avenues.  First, databases and results from the project will be made freely available to the scientific community.  Second, the project team will engage the SHINE community through the SHINE workshop to take part in a challenge to use the observed ICME events as campaign events to test models.  Third, the project will support an early career, female scientist, thereby contributing towards retaining highly qualified young scientists in academic research and promoting the advancement of women in science.  Fourth, the Co-Is will teach undergraduate and graduate classes related to space science, and the research results will be incorporated, when possible, into advanced undergraduate and graduate classes.  The project team will utilize the scientific outcome of this project to motivate and educate students, teachers, and the public with an appreciation of the importance of solar physics and STEM fields in general by leveraging the special initiatives of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS) at UNH.  Therefore, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research."

Nonlinear effects are precisely those that generate interactions between such waves.  The principal objective of this project is to study models that combine both phenomena.  However, it has become evident that further progress on these problems requires a deeper understanding of the purely dispersive effects; correspondingly, a significant fraction of the project is directed toward this goal.  In particular, the principal investigator will focus on situations where the dispersive behavior is complicated either by taking place in a region of finite extent or in a heterogeneous medium.  Although the project focuses on simple models, these embody fundamental hurdles appearing much more broadly in the theory of wave motion.  All the models under consideration can arise as mechanical systems.  It has recently been discovered that, at least for finite systems of particles, this places considerable restrictions on the possible behavior, far beyond those discovered in the nineteenth century; however, the full nature of these restrictions is poorly understood.  Part of the project is to exhibit (for the first time) such restrictions for equations modeling infinite systems of particles, spread over an infinite volume.<br/><br/>The project concerns several topics in dispersive partial differential equations, both linear and nonlinear.  Strichartz estimates encapsulate much about the linear flow in a manner well-adapted to the nonlinear theory.  Further study of such estimates in the setting of Schrodinger equations on compact manifolds will be undertaken, building on recent dramatic advances, including those of Bourgain and Demeter.  The treatment of scaling-critical nonlinear equations requires one to understand not just estimates for the linear flow, but also the defects of compactness therein.  Toward this direction, the principal investigator seeks to obtain mass-critical profile decompositions for models with nonconstant coefficients, building on some initial successes in this direction.  Turning now to truly nonlinear questions, nonsqueezing results will be sought in two distinct infinite-volume settings.  Recall that nonsqueezing is a peculiar property of general finite-dimensional Hamiltonian flows uncovered by Gromov saying that no ball can flow wholly into a cylinder whose (symplectic) cross-section has lesser radius.  Past work has been restricted to tori, which aids significantly in the development of finite dimensional approximations.  Due to substantial differences in the nature of complete integrability, the low-regularity theory of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is further advanced on the torus than on the whole line.  The project seeks to make some inroads on the low-regularity problem for the line, building on a recently developed method for global control of Sobolev/Besov norms that works simultaneously in both geometries."

While a vast amount of data are being generated and are available for analyses, traditional methods often fail to elicit information in such applications. This research project has two major goals.  First, it seeks to develop new mathematical tools for analyzing a recent complex statistical approach for correlated data that has been known to produce astonishingly accurate results in empirical studies, but lacks any theoretical justification. It is hoped that the new theoretical tool will lead to further refinements of existing statistical methodology for correlated data. The second part of the project is concerned with complex inferential issues for high dimensional data where the number of unknown parameters far exceeds the sample size, such as determining the role of a few important genes among a collection of several thousand genes from data on a few hundred patients. The project seeks to develop theoretical and methodological statistical tools to enable researchers to address important inference questions without stringent model assumptions. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop some critical theoretical tools and nonparametric statistical methodology for the analysis of time series and high dimensional data. Specifically, this project will focus on (i) developing asymptotic expansion results for the ""fixed-b"" asymptotic approach in time series that has shown significant improvement over traditional methods in several empirical studies but with very little theoretical underpinning; (ii) investigating higher order properties of some general classes of statistical tests (e.g., Wald tests) and of some more recently proposed nonstandard empirical likelihood tests, both under the ""fixed-b"" formulation; (iii) developing new pivotal quantities for block bootstrap in time series that nearly match the accuracy of bootstrap under independence; (iv) developing asymptotic expansion results in high dimensions under sparsity by exploiting some novel tools from approximation theory and Banach space theory; (v) applying the asymptotic expansion results from (iv) to investigate the ""phase transition"" phenomenon in asymptotic properties of statistical methods in high dimensions, and (vi) investigating properties of resampling methods for post-variable selection inference in high dimensions."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

These equations are of the evolution type and involve the curvature which measures how a space is curved. They play a fundamental role in understanding the natural world through mathematical means and are closely related to the study of the field theories in physics. They have also found many deep applications in geometry and topology. A famous example is Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture by using Ricci flow. The resolution of the problems in this project will provide mathematical foundations for some physical theories and have further profound applications to long-standing mathematical problems such as the classification of algebraic spaces. The most common phenomena of these equations are their singular behaviors due to the nonlinearity of the equations. Such behaviors are reflected in the possible break-downs in the evolution process and described in terms of singular solutions to these equations which describe the evolution process. It is still challenging to have a complete mathematical understanding of these singular solutions. This project will address some basic problems on these singular solutions and explore their applications to geometry and topology. The PI will give lectures and teach graduate courses on topics directly related to this project. He will also run a geometry working seminar with a goal of helping students to gain research experiences and broaden their knowledge in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project concerns curvature flows and equations in Riemannian geometry. For Ricci flow, the PI will focus on (1) Finite time singularity formation for its solutions in Kahler geometry; (2) The interaction between the singularity formation and geometry of the underlying spaces; (3) The long-time behavior of the solutions. For the Hermitian curvature flow, the PI will develop new analytic tools to study how it forms singularity. One of most prominent Hermitian curvature flow is the pluriclosed flow which is connected to the renormalization group flow of the nonlinear sigma model with B-field. The PI will further explore this connection and gives new mathematical insights for the duality in the string theory on one hand, new understanding of finite-time singularity on the other hand. For the symplectic curvature flow, the PI intends to study how to characterize the maximal existence of the flow by cohomological condition and how it develops finite-time singularity in dimension 4. The PI also intends to extend the compactness theory for Einstein metrics to a more general class of Kahler metrics and 4-dimensional anti-self-dual metrics. He also continues his study on fundamental problems in symplectic geometry which involve certain gauge equation. The problems include constructing new deformation invariants for symplectic manifolds which admit a Hamiltonian S1-action and providing a mathematical theory for the gauged linear sigma model. These problems are important in symplectic geometry and are inspired by the topological field theories in physics."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a label-free, highly sensitive, chemiresistive nanosensor platform. This goal will be achieved through a series of research tasks: 1) development of an ultrasensitive carbon nanotube chemiresistive biosensor on paper; 2) development of an effective fluid handling technology; and 3) integration and demonstration of label-free, multiplexed detection of cardiac biomarkers as model antigens. Intellectual merits include a highly sensitive sensing element made of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes and technological innovations of microfluidic transport, which collectively enable the proposed nanosensor.

In particular, the proposed label-free chemiresistive biosensor array is expected to be highly sensitive, facile, and economical. It is also expected to be readily applicable to the multiplexed detection of analytes in a variety of complex fluid matrices such as food, water, plants, and body fluids.

Despite their strengths, the reliance of such formally precise techniques on computationally heavy constraint solvers means that it can take a significant amount of time to verify the properties of software. This research devises a novel, and fully automated technique for efficient analysis of evolving software systems. The principles emerging from this research provide the foundation for making formal analysis of evolving software systems less expensive to conduct and more scalable, which in turn enable the vibrant software industry to significantly improve the quality of its products. The research produces a new breed of technologies with promising benefits for reduced defect density in specifications, designs, and code, achieved at reasonable cost, and within the constraints of real industrial settings. <br/><br/>An opportunity to reduce the analysis time is presented by the fact that in a software development project, the formal specifications representing the software are unlikely to change completely from one analysis to the next. Unlike the existing analysis techniques that dispose of the prior results in response to changes in the system specification, the approach developed in this research automatically and efficiently updates the analysis results, where solutions to a prior system specification are leveraged to, among other things, narrow the space of values to be explored by the underlying constraint solver for the revised system specification, thereby greatly reducing the required computational effort.  The intellectual merit of this research is a suite of optimization techniques to foster bounded verification of evolving software systems. The project advances the state-of-the-art by making bounded formal verification of software more scalable and cost effective, thereby expanding the domains in which such techniques can be applied."

However, efficiency of solar cells based on existing metal oxides is typically low due to poor material properties.

This project tackles these issues via three synergistic approaches: i) theoretically predicting and synthesizing new alloys of multi-metal oxides with improved band gaps and higher charge mobilities for solar energy conversion, ii) coating thin layers of these new oxides onto nanowire-array current-collectors to enhance their efficiency and iii) using terahertz spectroscopy to study the bulk carrier dynamics and interfacial charge transfer in these nanostructured oxides and further improve efficiency. This multi-pronged approach is the first to i) investigate new multi-metal oxide alloys that hold much promise for band engineering via alloying while still achieving relatively high mobility, ii) simultaneously apply 'extremely-thin-absorber' nanostructuring and interfacial engineering strategies to improve the charge collection efficiency of multi-metal oxide absorbers and iii) study the ultrafast carrier dynamics in thin metal oxide absorbers on a nanostructured current-collector, focusing on both bulk carrier dynamics and charge extraction at the absorber/current-collector interface."

In addition to the strong correlations between 2D electrons, a further challenge in the problem is the unavoidable presence of disorder in real materials. Recent theoretical studies suggest that novel intermediate electronic phases might exist between the liquid and solid states in 2D systems when the interactions between particles are strong and the disorder is weak. However, it is far from clear whether such new intermediate states of matter exist in experiments. The goal of this project is to provide new insights to help unraveling this challenging problem in fundamental physics through new transport measurements on state-of-the-art samples with the highest purity. The results obtained through this research have broader implications to the deeper understanding of correlated condensed matter systems in general. Moreover, the project serves as a valuable platform to educate graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach pre-college students on cutting edge research in condensed matter and semiconductor physics.

These research experiences and skills are expected to prepare young students for continuing a successful career in either academia or industry. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The project aims to shed new light on the nature of strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) carriers in semiconductor quantum structures through new electronic and thermoelectric transport experiments on state-of-the-art semiconductor gallium arsenide 2D heterostructures. The scope of this research mainly encompasses the study of the Coulomb interaction driven 2D Fermi liquid to Wigner solid phase transition in correlated 2D hole or electron systems. In the past, various many-body quantum liquid and solid phases of 2D electrons have been found in the presence of a strong magnetic field. However, very little is known in experiment about how the quantum 2D Wigner solid transforms into the liquid phase when the magnetic field is small or absent, despite much theoretical interests and investigations. In this project, complementary electronic and thermoelectric (entropic) transport techniques are employed to elucidate the 2D liquid-solid transition in strongly correlated 2D carrier systems with weak disorder, and explore the emergence of new intermediate phase(s) driven by Coulomb interaction effects, as predicted in a number of theoretical studies."

Srivastava and Dr. Siva Murru. Prof. Radhey S. Srivastava is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Prof. Srivastava's group is developing novel catalytic systems to convert simple hydrocarbons to value-added products. The main goal of the proposed research is to design and develop novel catalytic systems for the production of valuable molecules that are of industrial significance. The method uses copper catalysts with chiral ligands. The demand for chiral allyl amines has escalated sharply in recent years, driven by the demands in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, flavors, fragrances, and materials. In addition, these catalytic methods are potential useful for the total synthesis of bioactive molecules and chiral drugs.  The researchers have introduced comprehensive educational and outreach programs associated with intellectual and economic development. Professor Srivastava's group has been working at the interface of organic, organometallics, and catalysis chemistry.  <br/><br/>This research addresses the development of a direct catalytic asymmetric amination of simple (non-functionalized) allylic carbon-hydrogen (C-H) substrates using hydroxylamines as aminating agents. The prior art on this field used oxidative amination to make chiral N-hydroxy allyl amines that require additional methods to make chiral allyl amines. The main aim is to find suitable catalytic systems that would deliver the chiral allyl amines with high yields and enantioselectivities. This approach includes rational design and synthesis of new chiral ligands and complexes.  The research project screens the catalysts under various reaction conditions while varying solvents, temperature, and additives. The next objective is to explore the synthetic applications to access valuable chemicals such as chiral beta-alkyl N-aryl Aza Baylis-Hillman (ABH) adducts, beta-amino esters and beta-lactams, as well as bioactive molecules such as hydroxymethyl docetaxel fragment, Ezetimibe, and Vigabatrin. Another objective is to address mechanistic aspects of the reaction and provide a better understanding of the reaction pathway and the catalytic activity.  This objective helps to develop new catalysts and novel synthetic methods. Professor Srivastava's program enhances public awareness of the importance of chemical sciences. Undergraduates, K-12 students, and high school teachers are exposed to cutting-edge science related to chemical catalysis through summer research and teacher training workshops. The education outreach initiatives involve the inclusion of women and underrepresented groups and strengthen competitiveness by promoting enhancement programs such as LSAMP and McNair program to retain students."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org."

They can can be covalently attached to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids), or exist as small, soluble molecules. Experimental techniques for studying glycans are not as well developed as for other types of biomolecules, including a lack of computational tools. This means it can be hard to decide which glycans contribute to protein function, how they act to modulate this function, and how to modify them to optimize interesting properties. Structural records of proteins, including glycosylated proteins, are appearing in ever larger numbers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). By selecting these glycosylated protein structures for deeper investigation with sophisticated computational tools, a knowledge-based approach to understanding the relationship between their structure, function and biological roles can be built. Knowledge based approaches allow both top-down understanding of biological roles, and bottom-up simulations of structural fluctuations at the atomic level; the latter provide very deep insight into how different glycans affect the folding and function of modified proteins. In addition, most proteins in cell membranes are glycosylated, which is important to cell recognition and signaling; more realistic modeling of biological membranes, provided by the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder toolset, will further enrich the available repertoire of membrane structure simulations. This project aims to achieve these goals by developing a comprehensive toolset for glycan modeling and simulation. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary computational structural glycobiology. In particular, this project will raise the scientific literacy of the research community through the publication of research results and workshop participation. <br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a computational toolset for modeling and simulation of glycan-containing biological systems and to acquire an in-depth and molecular-level understanding of glycan structure, dynamics, and function in the context of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and protein-glycan complexes. A comprehensive toolset for the computational analysis, modeling, and simulation of glycoconjugates and glycan-associated complexes will be developed. This tool set will include (1)  Glycan Modeler, a tool for structure prediction of protein-linked glycans from their primary sequences; (2) GLYSUM, the GLYcan monosaccharide SUbstitution Matrix, the glycan equivalent to the BLOSUM matrix; (3) GLDB, Glycan Ligand Database for easy retrieval of protein-glycan interaction patterns and motifs in the PDB; (4) GBS-Predictor, a template-based tool to predict potential glycan binding sites (GBS) in a target protein; and (5) glycolipid-containing Membrane Builder, an intuitive tool to build a complex membrane system containing glycolipids.

The investigators will employ, study, and assess an instructional and student learning model, called the Mathematics Emporium Model (MEM), to improve students' performance in introductory mathematics courses. These gatekeeper courses are normally taken during an intense and often difficult transition for students, from high school to college. The MEM eliminates lecture and uses commercially available interactive computer software combined with personalized on-demand assistance and mandatory student participation. The underlying principle of the Emporium Model is that students learn by doing. Research reveals that the shift to student-centered instructional practices enhances students' attitudes and beliefs about learning in mathematics courses and increases student-learning gains. In addition to student learning gains, project activities will lead to faculty and graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) who can use MEM to implement active learning pedagogies and be more engaged and effective in promoting and assessing student learning. The project will directly reach a combined annual enrollment in traditionally low-pass-rate courses of more than 4,000 students, who will be mostly from underrepresented groups. In addition, the project will have a long-term impact in that the participating GTAs represent future college faculty.<br/><br/>The goals of this project include: generating a transformative change in teaching practices; measuring the value-added of learning in the MEM environment versus a traditional classroom; generating a committed team of trained faculty members who are skilled in the use of the MEM for mathematics instruction and engaged in the national Emporium community; conducting research on the impact of the MEM model, especially on broadening participation for underrepresented groups of students; and disseminating research and implementation findings to other institutions of higher education. Data will be systematically collected and analyzed to provide formative feedback for project improvement as well as to study overall project impact.  Student learning and instructor professional development will be investigated using mixed methods, repeated measures, and hierarchical models.  Outcomes of the project will include additions to the body of research on (1) the impact of an a MEM approach on learning gains, especially for minority students, and (2) the professional development needs of faculty to implement active-learning experiences in MEM and other undergraduate classrooms successfully. As a result, the project will (a) enhance national broadening participation efforts in STEM, especially related to emporium-type approaches, and (b) inform other institutions in this realm.<br/><br/>This project is funded through the Division of Undergraduate Education with co-funding from the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program  (HBCU-UP) in the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD).

Such systems are usually multidimensional, and their modeling, prediction, and control have tremendous social and scientific impacts. Isolating and identifying equilibrium or stationary features are of fundamental importance in prediction and control of such systems. This research project aims to develop methodologies for extracting aspects of multivariate nonstationary processes that display a sense of equilibrium or stationarity. It is interdisciplinary in nature and has immediate applications to the analysis of economics, seismology, and neuroscience data. A graduate student will be involved in the research. <br/><br/>This research project aims to elevate the concept and theory of cointegration from multivariate integrated time series rooted in economics theory to the more general multivariate nonstationary time series setup in probability and statistics. In spite of its central role in econometrics in the last four decades and well-founded motivations in economics, the cointegration theory suffers from the requirements that the series be integrated (unit-root nonstationary) and satisfy a vector autoregressive and moving average model. The goal of this project is to avoid such restrictions and focus on general multivariate nonstationary time series. Three distinct methods for computing analogues of cointegrating vectors and the cointegrating rank will be developed. The first is a time-domain method in line with the classical (Johansen's) approach that relies on the reduced rank regression and likelihood ratio tests.  The second method is in the spectral domain and relies on the idea of projection pursuit. It searches for coefficients of candidate linear combinations by minimizing a projection index measuring the discrepancy between time-varying and constant spectral density functions. The third method is concerned with a time-varying cointegration setup where the coefficients are piecewise constant over time. Its successful implementation rests on a good solution of the problem of change-point detection for nonstationary processes, and a novel solution is explored in this research. The results will have immediate impact in settings where multivariate time series data are collected, such as in financial markets, epidemiology, environmental monitoring, and global change."

Affinity-based sensing with fluorescence-based labels remains one of the most prevalent form of sensing of bio-molecules and while they are routinely used in hospitals, reference labs, and blood banks to screen for infectious diseases, current optical-based sensing technology is still complex consisting of an assembly of electronic, optical and mechanical components including lenses, objectives, collimators, multilayer thin film filters, monchrometers, photo-multiplier tubes, fiber optics, precision mechanical scanners etc., making the system large, bulky, expensive and non-portable. On the other hand, Complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, provides an unparalleled platform for integration of extremely complex systems, with high yield in a cost-efficient manner. The goal of the proposal is to co-opt CMOS technology and combine with new methods to integrate optical elements on the chip to realize portable, chip-scale, fluorescence-based biomolecular sensing technology. Miniaturizing an entire fluorescence sensing system from the biochemical platform to the sensor and scanner on one chip with a low-cost, optical excitation source can potentially open up completely new methodologies of in-vitro and in-vivo sensing and imaging. The ability to simultaneously sense multiple genetic as well as protein biomarkers in a rapid and multiplexed detection platform can also drastically improve the statistics of detection, critically important for diagnostics. The crosscut approach towards this project will engage and train both graduate and undergraduate students across multiple disciplines. The PI will also engage high-school seniors from local schools and broadly disseminate the knowledge through his undergraduate and graduate courses and through publications, seminars and workshops.<br/><br/>The detection methodology for an affinity-based bio-sensor platform relies on selective target biomolecules by capturing probes and the chemistry is transduced label-free using methods such as impedance-spectroscopy, electro-analysis, Raman scattering or with magnetic, dielectric or optical labels. While detecting changes in the optical fields are mature in CMOS-based image sensors, in absence of high-performance integrated optical components, miniaturization of a fluorescence sensing system in CMOS has relied on time-resolved techniques with synchronized sources or externally grown optical filters and/or collimators which can add complexity and cost to the system. The goal of this proposal is to investigate methods by which optical field manipulation can be achieved in standard CMOS technology exploiting sub-wavelength interaction of metal-photonic nanostructures with incident optical fields in the visible range. Specifically, this work proposes design of electronic-nanophotonic architectures, signal-processing techniques and bio-interfaces on-chip with integrated 3D nanophotonic elements for massively multiplexed, fluorescence-based bio-assays. These structures are capable of excitation light suppression across a wide range of incidence angles and allow the fluorescence signal to pass, and get detected and processed over a multitude of sensor sites to enable high-density functionalized optical biosensor chips.  Integrated nanoplasmonic structures in the visible range in CMOS with embedded electronics can lead to complex and miniaturized optical systems-on-chip for new applications in sensing and imaging."

The recovery of even a fraction of these large losses would have a significant environmental impact. This project explores semiconductor multilayer structures for converting this otherwise wasted heat into useful electricity. The objectives of the project are to achieve extensive and systematic understanding of the fundamental aspects of the multilayer semiconductor structures, and to advance the knowledge of how underlying physical processes affect their electrical and optical properties. This enables development of novel concepts for effective conversion of radiant energy from a heat source into electricity. The project offers graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma unique opportunities to pursue education, training and research in multidisciplinary topics, such as materials science, quantum engineering, photonics, and device fabrication. This project also enhances Oklahoma's infrastructure for science and technology development and opens new opportunities for students from under-represented groups. <br/><br/>Technical Description: Narrow bandgap materials are desirable for making efficient thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells that convert the otherwise-wasted radiant energy from a heat source into useful electrical energy. The TPV devices take advantage of the type-II band alignment of InAs/GaSb interfaces to form multi-stage cascade structures. These multi-stage structures have many potential advantages including: significantly improved collection efficiency for photo-generated carriers, a wide range of infrared spectral coverage, high open-circuit voltage due to the cascade architecture, as well as the benefits of current matching through adjustments of the number of cascade stages and the thickness of individual absorber layers. Consequently, these narrow bandgap materials enable TPV cells that effectively absorb infrared radiant photons from a heat source and efficiently convert them into electricity. The power conversion efficiency is expected to approach 20%, which would be remarkably high for a TPV system operating at long wavelengths and with a modest light intensity from a low temperature source. The approach and tasks involve: theory development and designs for multi-stage TPV structures, molecular beam epitaxial growth of the TPV structures, material characterization, and prototype device fabrication and characterization. The TPV cells enabled by multi-stage structures have important applications for waste-heat recovery, more efficient use of solar energy, space exploration, power beaming, as well as portable and quiet energy sources. This project not only advances the understanding of physical processes, it also generates new knowledge in the design of quantum-engineered structures and broadens their applications. The advancement of narrow bandgap multi-stage TPV structures in the mid-infrared wavelength region is a critical step toward harvesting energy from widely available heat sources."

Classifying the behaviors and the conditions under which they occur has been a high priority for more than two decades, and it may prove key to eventually fabricating useful materials including room-temperature superconductors. This project explores the role of magnetic frustration, where a system favors local magnetic configurations which are not mutually compatible. The system must satisfy some local constraints but not others, leading to a large number of states with the same or very similar energy. Squeezing a sample along a single direction can shift the energy levels to a broader range, thereby reducing the influence of frustration on the sample's behavior. This project applies such unidirectional pressure and measures how it changes a sample's low-temperature electrical and magnetic behavior. Understanding the effects of frustration may help in designing materials with specific desired properties in the future. The specialized cooling and pressure techniques provide excellent training for the graduate and undergraduate students who perform the experiments.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>A major question in the low-temperature behavior of Yb-based heavy-fermion compounds is whether Kondo breakdown occurs, with a discontinuous jump in the size of the Fermi surface. More generally, the role of geometrical effects, such as geometic frustration and crystal dimensionality, should be ascertained. Uniaxial pressure is a natural technique for this purpose, since it affects both frustration and dimensionality more strongly than does hydrostatic pressure. This research involves specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and transport measurements under uniaxial pressure up to 1 GPa, temperatures down to 30 mK, and magnetic fields up to 10 Tesla. These measurements establish a pressure-temperature-field phase diagram which reveals the importance of geometry among many competing influences. Of special note is the behavior of T*, the onset temperature for hybridization between the conduction electrons and local moments, under uniaxial pressure. T* is surprisingly stable to the related tuning techniques of hydrostatic pressure and chemical doping. One of the goals of this proposal is to test if the stability of the T* line occurs for uniaxial pressure as well."

The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Blake Meyers.<br/><br/>All flowering plants have structures called anthers that produce male pollen during reproduction. In the sub-group of monocots, a unique class of small molecules, called small RNAs, are expressed in anthers just before pollen is produced. These small RNAs regulate how genes are turned on and off at specific times, thus likely ensuring normal reproduction. Despite the importance of these small RNAs, details of their function and regulation are not well understood. This project investigates when and how these small RNAs evolved in the grasses, thereby clarifying their functional importance in the context of evolution. Information will be conveyed through an outreach project with public gardens. In collaboration with the Longwood Garden (Philadelphia, PA) and the Missouri Botanic Garden (St. Louis, MO), the genome of the Longwood Hybrid water lily will be sequenced, and the resulting information will contribute to a public garden exhibit that connects genetics to evolution in this group of early-diverging flowering plants.   <br/><br/>The aims of this project are to identify the key evolutionary events underlying the origin of 21 and 24nt phased, secondary, small interfering RNAs particularly in the monocots. Interestingly, a duplication event led to the presence of a monocot-specific Dicer-like protein, DCL5. Transcriptome sequencing of meiotic anthers across diverse groups of monocots will be used to carefully pinpoint the phylogenetic placement of the duplication event that led to the divergence of Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) and Dicer-like 5 (DCL5) in the monocots. After identifying this duplication event, a phylogenetically diverse subset of DCL5 genes will be transformed into the maize male-sterile DCL5 knockout to attempt to rescue function. Simultaneously, in situ hybridization and immunolocalizations will be performed across phylogenetically diverse monocots to identify potential changes in protein localization in the anther, further clarifying function during reproductive development."

One major area for improvement is the manipulation of plant architecture. The patterning of flowers along the shoot (phyllotaxy) determines the positioning of grain or fruit along a stem. A key player in the process of phyllotaxy is the plant hormone auxin. Recent research in the Nemhauser Lab has found that phyllotactic patterning in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana can be altered by changing one protein in the auxin response pathway. This project aims to test whether these findings can be applied to multiple plant species. If successful, this work will pilot a pipeline for rapid engineering of desirable agronomic traits into diverse crops with limited genomic infrastructure. Research findings will be disseminated through publications and presentations at scientific conferences. Public outreach will include workshops with high school and middle school students to facilitate understanding of basic biological concepts surrounding plant biology.<br/><br/>Evolution has given rise to a staggering diversity of body plans. Effective methods for altering the patterning of organ emergence around the shoot are of agronomic interest, as phyllotactic patterning affects light harvesting capacity and determines the density of grain or fruit along a stem. Through the novel application of plant synthetic biology tools, the Nemhauser Lab has found that phyllotactic patterning can be altered by re-programming degradation rates of IAA28, an auxin repressor protein. Auxin-mediated degradation of repressive Aux/IAA substrate proteins via the E3-ubiquitin ligase pathway induces auxin-mediated transcriptional responses. BARREN INFLORESCENCE 4, a putative ortholog of IAA28 in Zea mays, also plays a role in phyllotaxy, suggesting that that the diversity in natural phyllotactic patterns across plant species can be explained in part by variation in auxin repressors. This project focuses on the readily tune-able parameter of auxin-induced degradation rate as a potential mechanism to precision engineer new body plans. These studies will be performed in parallel in three plants: Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays and Brassica rapa."

Due to the fact that there is a need to obtain reversal records from volcanic sequences in order to have a better understanding of the generation of the Earth's magnetic field, it is proposed to study a long sequence (about ~191 meters) of lavas from the island Oahu, Hawaii at a site known as Makapuu Point, Koolau Volcano with the main objective of investigating the full range of paleomagnetic signals recorded before during and after several successive polarity transitions. The section covering ~410,000 years of field changes includes the possibility of studying the detailed recording of the successive magnetic field reversals such as the Gauss-Matuyama, Cryptochron C2r.2r-1 and the onset of the Reunion Subchron, since the base of the section is 2.60+/-0.13 million years old, the middle part is 2.49+/-0.07 million years old and about 10 m below the top of the section the age is ~2.19+/-0.12 million years old. The objectives of this 2 year research study are related to the knowledge of field variations during periods like reversals and excursions and related to the critical time intervals that precede and follow reversals that so far have only been documented from a few sedimentary sequences, for the interval between 2.6 to ~2.012 Ma. Reversal studies cannot be separated from the surrounding polarity intervals and most records published so far were not long enough to provide complete information. The sequence offers the exceptional opportunity to study changes over a time period that includes several polarity intervals and thus documents the paleofield behavior over various time constants. This is a basic condition to extract and bring up significant constraints for the theoretical and numerical modeling of the generation of the paleofield. This research will have impacts on field like magnetostatigraphy, rock magnetism, geomagnetism and physical volcanism.  Several undergraduate students will be supported and involved in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>The proposal is focused on full vector studies in order to determine the total field vector and Paleosecular Variation (PSV) of the ""stable"" polarities. The study will focus on the successive periods of polarity and their associated reversals. The paleointensity experiments will be conducted using a version of the Thellier-Coe as well as the differential pTRM ""multi-specimen"" methods. The PIs have imposed severe criteria to discard samples affected by magneto-mineralogical transformations and with magnetization components involving multi-domain grains. It is important to deal with paleointensity values that rely on a minimum number of 5 to 8 determinations per flow in order to perform suitable statistical treatment. Given the time consuming aspect of paleointensity studies, a two-year period is envisaged to achieve the goals of this proposal including 10 more radiometric 40Ar/39Ar age determinations. The principal investigator and four undergraduate students will carry out the entire research project. The involvement of undergraduate students will be a priority in this project, from fieldwork, laboratory work, analysis and publication of the results.  Data will be disseminated through publication and on the web and community maintained paleomagnetic and geochronologic databases. This project will provide the stimulus to maintain the paleomagnetics operation at UH and the Rare Gas Lab. at the Univ. of Wisconsin at Madison both of which are used by a diverse group of students and researchers from all over the world."

A canonical example of neural computation is the eye's detection of visual motion, which employs mathematical operations that are present in many circuits in the brains of many animals. This research investigates the mathematical operations that describe the output of this neural computation, as well as how those operations are implemented by specific neurons in the circuit and how the selection of specific operations changes the performance of the circuit. The broader impact of this project focuses on high school outreach, where it will teach a module on visual perception and illusions. The project will also focus on bringing high school and undergraduate students into lab to perform research in an accessible experimental system.<br/>	<br/>This research focuses on the small circuit of motion detecting neurons in the eye of the fruit fly Drosophila. The fruit fly's eye is an ideal target for study because its circuit is small and increasingly identified; genetic tools allow us to manipulate and measure from individual, identified neuron types in order to test hypotheses; and a long-standing modeling framework can be used to interpret results. To understand the details of the circuit's computation, we will use behavioral psychophysics and in vivo calcium imaging to record circuit responses to specially designed visual stimuli that isolate specific neural computations. We will use responses to these stimuli and others to simulate circuit responses to visual stimuli. Genetic silencing will allow us to identify neurons that are involved in the motion computation. These experiments will lead us to an understanding of which nonlinear operations are implemented in this circuit, and how those operations affect the circuit's performance."

Geometry and mathematical physics have traditionally focused on smooth geometric objects called manifolds, but a slightly more general class of geometric objects called stratified spaces is equally ubiquitous. Despite this, only recently have specific techniques been developed appropriate to study detailed analytic problems on these spaces. One goal of this project is a continuation of the PI's long-term goal of establishing certain strong analytic techniques to study a wide variety of problems in geometric analysis which are set on such stratified spaces. Other goals of this project include applications of these techniques to problems occurring in gauge theory and in mathematical relativity. This has significant cross-disciplinary appeal between partial differential equations, geometric analysis and mathematical physics, and modulates between the parallel goals of developing general techniques and solving specific problems of interest in various disciplines.<br/><br/>Geometric microlocal analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to study a range of problems concerning differential and pseudodifferential operators with degeneracies. Such operators arise in many applications in geometric analysis and mathematical physics. The PI's current research interest centers on the development of a calculus of iterated edge pseudodifferential operators which can be used as an investigative tool to study elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic operators on stratified pseudomanifolds. The ultimate goal in this is a theory paralleling and generalizing the Boutet de Monvel calculus, which provides the most general and natural setting to study elliptic boundary problems on manifolds with boundary. The PI intends to use this calculus to study specific problems, including Kaehler-Einstein metrics with edge singularities along normal crossing divisors and singular solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations. Closely related research projects include a new approach to study the asymptotic geometry of certain gauge-theoretic moduli spaces, in particular the moduli space of solutions to the Hitchin equations on a Riemann surface, and the continuation of a program to understand the blowup profiles of families of solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint equations in mathematical relativity."

Metals are often used in Nature due to the unique reactivity they provide when they are bound to a protein (e.g., metalloenzymes).  Proteins play key roles in the uptake, transport, use and excretion of biologically essential metals (e.g., zinc, copper, iron), as well as toxic ones (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium), by living organisms. Dr. Wilcox's studies are providing fundamental insights into how proteins interact with metal ions in the cell. Additionally, students working on this project are gaining important knowledge and valuable skills for their careers in science and education, thereby enhancing the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This research quantifies the thermodynamics of metal ions binding to proteins in order to provide a better understanding of metal contributions to protein stability and protein modulation of metal redox properties. Fundamental new insights about metal-protein interactions are being obtained from studies that correlate metal-binding thermodynamics to the thermodynamics of metal stabilization of the resulting metalloprotein.  The Wilcox group quantifies solvent contributions to metal-binding thermodynamics, and determine metal contributions (bonding, electrostatics) to metalloproteins binding to DNA. A method that determines the metalloprotein reduction thermodynamics from calorimetric measurements of metal binding is being applied to selected metalloproteins and enzymes.  These methods provide insight into protein modulation of the metal reduction potential, as well as proton transfer accompanying reduction. Several variants of azurin with higher and lower reduction potentials, polysaccharide monooxygenase, which has a unique Cu(I) coordination, and tyramine-monooxygenase, which has two mechanistically-distinct copper ions are being studied. Finally, this method is being extended to studies of the copper enzyme superoxide dismutase to quantify the thermodynamics and accompanying proton transfer reactions."

However, it is not known how they could be combined to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Fascinating phenomena such as the very first stages of the big bang or the cores of black holes therefore remain out of the reach of our current understanding. This project investigates a wide range of systems in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics are relevant. The main interest is given by methods that allow one to derive physical implications by approximations, and to use the results to guide the developments of quantum gravity. Applications to the big bang and black holes often lead to conclusions that capture the interest of the general public. Related methods can also be used in systems not involving general relativity, where they may help to solve technical questions or to communicate results in a new way, supporting for instance the teaching of quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to introduce and evaluate new methods for a systematic analysis of physical implications of one set of candidate theories of quantum gravity, based on canonical quantization. Throughout physics, a powerful tool to derive potentially observable phenomena is given by effective theories which provide quantum corrections to the classical equations. Such systems can more easily be evaluated, analytically or numerically, than equations for quantum states and thus are more direct sources for the discovery of new phenomena. While standard techniques to derive effective equations do not apply to canonical quantum gravity, a general scheme applicable to canonical quantum theories exists (introduced by the PI) and is used in this project to address the main problems of quantum gravity. It provides the basis for a long-term program evaluating physical phenomena in the broad context of quantum gravity. Such a systematic derivation will make it possible to put effects found previously in simplified models on a firm footing, uncover new phenomena and provide reliable predictions. Results will be used to compare the theory with other candidates of quantum gravity, with the potential of a fruitful transfer of ideas and techniques between the approaches."

Solar cells that use organic conducting polymers to convert light to electricity ? organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices - offer a potentially low-cost route for renewable electricity production.  However, in order to achieve parity with other solar photovoltaic technologies, organic solar cells must increase their power conversion efficiency.  This project will incorporate light-active materials into the organic polymer solar cell device to promote a quantum mechanical process called triplet fusion.  It is believed that triplet fusion can increase the voltage of the power output, leading to higher solar energy conversion efficiency. This concept is innovative from a scientific point of view because it will focus on increasing the voltage potential, not the photocurrent, leading to a pathway to increase solar cell efficiency through an increase in thermodynamic efficiency.  The educational activities associated with this project include participation in the Princeton University Materials Academy that teaches hands-on materials science to under-represented high school students from the Trenton, New Jersey, and multi-generational outreach through the Nano Materials Science Day at a local library that encourages students, teachers, and parents to meet with solar scientists and participate in hands-on demos to make and test simple solar cell devices. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the research is to develop a new, organic polymer-based excitonic solar photovoltaic device architecture that has the potential exceed classical thermodynamic power conversion efficiency limits through the process of triplet fusion.  In triplet fusion, two excitons formed from two low-energy sub band gap photons are required to produce one higher-energy photon.  The integration of sensitized phosphorescent materials into the organic photovoltaic (OPV) device architecture offers the means to achieve triplet fusion.  In a phosphor-sensitized OPV device, absorption and singlet formation occurs primarily on a fluorescent host donor. This initial absorption event is followed by energy transfer to a phosphorescent guest present in the donor layer at low concentration.  Excitons on the phosphorescent guest then transfer to the triplet level of the host, permitting the population of the long-lived triplet state in the fluorescent material. This process of triplet fusion will be used to create free charge carriers with higher energy than the exciton from which the carriers originated.  In essence, this device configuration represents the molecular analogue to an intermediate band solar cell, but possesses similar limiting efficiencies as singlet fission-based solar cells.  The main distinction between the triplet fusion device and a conventional intermediate band solar cell is that, in the triplet fusion device, the intermediate band is satisfied via the fusion of two low energy triplet excitons into a higher energy singlet exciton. Furthermore, whereas the singlet fission device looks to increase photocurrent, the one based upon triplet fusion looks to increase the photovoltage, leading to fundamental enhancement of the thermodynamic efficiency.  To explore this new phenomenon, the research has two major objectives.  The first objective is to demonstrate the functionality of the phosphor-sensitized OPV device for achieving triplet fusion, and the second objective is to understand efficiency-limiting mechanisms involved with multiple exciton devices through comprehensive electrical and optical characterization. Ultimately, the demonstration of a triplet fusion OPV device adds another option to exceed Shockley-Queisser limits and inspire work toward high efficiency organic solar cells."

A technology termed pulsed-field hybridization will be developed by combining electric field control of molecular behavior with optimized sensor designs, based on synthetic DNA analogues, to eliminate errors and to significantly shorten analysis time. The project also encompasses educational goals centered on design of learning software that illustrates molecular properties and on organization of publicly accessible science lectures and demonstrations.<br/><br/><br/>Biosensing applications must handle complex sample matrices in which the analyte of interest needs to be distinguished against a background of other molecules. In nucleic acid diagnostics, background interference most often involves cross-hybridization from DNA or RNA molecules with a degree of similarity to the desired sequence. Cross-hybridization leads to multiple detrimental consequences including blocking binding of the perfectly matched analyte, markedly slowing down approach to equilibrium so that assay endpoints are defined by kinetic history rather than path-independent thermodynamics, and loss of precision due to contributions from the cross-hybridized species. These concerns become amplified for sequence-rich samples comprising larger genomes, mixtures of genetic material from multiple sources, or when the sequence of interest is one of several closely related sequences. This project proposes a bioanalytical method termed pulsed field hybridization (PFH) to solve these challenges. Through use of charge-neutral DNA analogues called morpholinos and modulated electric fields, PFH seeks highly efficient, field-based manipulation of hybridization to dramatically reduce equilibration timescales and to enable ""distilling"", through a stage-wise operation, of the purity of the hybridized product. The project will develop a thorough fundamental understanding of how surface fields influence thermodynamics and kinetics of hybridization on morpholino-derivatized sensors, and of the impact of analyte characteristics including excess nucleotides, unhybridized tails, and variously placed mismatches. These fundamental studies will be accompanied by application to complex sample matrices typical of clinical situations to demonstrate a fully functional, practical method. Project participants will in addition assist with research exhibitions open to the public, engage in organizing lectures on nanoscience, and collaborate on development of learning software to provide a fun, informative look into the behavior of molecules. <br/><br/><br/>"

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions.

LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses.

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models.

The shape restrictions to be studied include monotone, convex, log-concave, and log-convex functions. He aims to develop new basic empirical process tools and methods and to apply the new tools to problems involving shape-restricted inference, semiparametric models, bootstrap inference methods, and problems in high-dimensional statistics. The investigator intends also to introduce and evaluate new methods of estimation in semiparametric models based on complex sampling designs with missing data by design, and for estimation in semiparametric models defined by shape constraints."

Investigators have shown that a variety of singular proteins derived from the cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM) promote cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation or cardiac differentiation of stem cells, but little work has been done to identify the short peptide sequences on those proteins, termed matrikines, that are the active ingredients leading to the altered cellular responses. Based on preliminary data that indicates that cardiac cells respond differently to cECM obtained from fetal compared to adult hearts, the investigators of this 3 year project are going to test the hypothesis that there exists a number of matrikines in the developing heart ECM that could be useful in strategies for cardiac regeneration and repair, via enhancement of CM proliferation and survival and the cardiac differentiation of stem cells. Identification of these matrikines would be significant for understanding the importance of cECM remodeling during cardiac growth as well as for the potential development of therapeutics for the treatment of cardiac injury or disease.   Educational impact will be made at the undergraduate and graduate levels through integration of techniques and results in courses and laboratories; impact at the high school level will be made through seminars at local high schools and as part of the Biomedical Engineering department's summer research program for high school students. <br/><br/>The composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a powerful regulator of a number of cellular processes. In the heart, a variety of singular proteins derived from the cardiac ECM (cECM) promote cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation or cardiac differentiation of stem cells.  Most investigations to date have examined only singular ECM proteins as binding sites for the cells, even though the ECM in vivo is a complex mixture of proteins that is organ/ tissue and life stage specific.  Furthermore, the emphasis has been on singular proteins rather than on the short peptide segments/matrkines that are likely to be the bioactive region leading to altered cellular responses.  The investigators' lab has shown that cECM derived from fetal hearts promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation as compared to ECM derived from adult hearts and that cardiac progenitor cells have altered differentiation responses to cECM derived from different developmental stages.  Thus, the goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that there exists a number of matrikines in the developing heart ECM that could be useful in strategies for cardiac regeneration and repair, via enhancement of CM proliferation and survival and the cardiac differentiation of stem cells.  The hypothesis will be tested by carrying out two aims: 1) Identify and characterize matrikines derived from fetal and adult cECM (pigs at 3rd trimester and 3-6 months) that promote induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation to cardiac cells and/or enhance proliferation or maturation of iPSC-derived CMs (iPSC-CMs) and 2) Assess the efficacy of the matrikines derived from cECM in promoting human iPSC-CM survival, proliferation and function in 3-D engineered cardiac tissue models of healthy and diseased myocardium.   Identification of these matrikines would be significant for understanding the importance of cECM remodeling during cardiac growth as well as for the potential development of therapeutics for the treatment of cardiac injury or disease.   Educational impact will be made at the undergraduate and graduate levels through integration of techniques and results in courses and laboratories; impact at the high school level will be made through seminars at local high schools and as part of the BME department's summer research program for high school students."

The understanding of this question has had profound influence on our daily life, in a variety of areas ranging from e-commerce, cloud computing, to travel planning and weather forecast. In this project the PI seeks to understand how to efficiently use the valuable resource of randomness (such as coin flips) in computation.<br/><br/>Randomness is extremely useful in computation and widely used in practice. Simulation of complex models such as those used for weather forecast and economy prediction relies on the use of random processes, and modern computer security will be lost completely without randomness. In this context, the project studies the fundamental questions of the power and limitations of randomness in computation. From a theoretical aspect, it can lead to breakthroughs towards solving long standing open questions in computer science, such as whether randomness is really necessary for algorithms. From a practical aspect, it can lead to improvements in several areas important to society, such as designing streaming and scalable computation protocols for massive datasets, enhancing computer security in an adversarial environment, and tolerating errors in communication protocols. Based on the research activities, the educational component in this project plans to train several Ph.D. students, publish online surveys for free access, integrate research outcomes into courses the PI is or will be teaching, and provide research opportunities for minority students through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>The questions that will be addressed in this project include how to generate high quality randomness for computation, how to use randomness in the presence of information leakage or tampering by an adversary, and how to use randomness to detect and correct errors introduced in communications. Two fundamental objects and tools for studying these questions are pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors. A pseudorandom generator is an algorithm that stretches a small number of random bits into a large number of bits that appear to be perfectly random to a certain class of functions. A randomness extractor is an algorithm that converts low quality random sources into very high quality random bits. The project will explore new ways of constructing these objects, as well as the connections between these objects and other areas in computer science, such as cryptography, error correcting codes, and computational complexity. Through this the PI seeks to establish new connections between different areas, and thus leading to possible new breakthroughs."

Such a compass works because its tiny magnetic needle aligns with the magnetic field of Earth and indicates the direction of North.  On scales much larger than Earth, our own Milky Way Galaxy also has its own magnetic field.  In fact, all galaxies in the Universe appear to have magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields can have profound effects on a galaxy's development throughout its lifetime.  Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.  Such a result could have a profound influence on our current understanding of fundamental physics, and its pursuit serves the national interest of developing US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training undergraduate and graduate students in general and computational astrophysics.  Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.<br/><br/>More technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources."

A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals."

For certain conditions, the droplets line up to form chains of drops that persist and sometimes coalesce to form thin liquid strands.  Chain formation is only observed for confined emulsions of deformable drops.  The investigators hypothesize that small changes in the flow, caused by the deformable drops, induce the drops to align in chains.  The hypothesis will be tested by carrying out numerical simulations that solve the equations governing the deformation of the drops and their motion in confined flows.  By varying material parameters, the investigators can gradually increase the extent of drop deformation, which should be correlated with the degree of chain formation.  The research team will collaborate with a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology who first observed the chaining phenomenon experimentally.  Additional experiments will be carried out to compare data with the computer simulations developed in this project. The team expects that understanding the microscale flow patterns leading to drop alignment can be harnessed to make new microstructured materials.  The researchers will engage local high school students in Yale's Pathway to Science Program by teaching students to write simple computer programs that simulate motions of particles in fluids.  They will also develop activities for fifth through eleventh grade girls attending a residential summer camp at Texas Tech called ""Science: It's a Girl Thing.""<br/><br/>The project will verify the hypothesis that quadrupolar flow-field patterns produced by deformable immiscible drops in a strongly confined shear flow are responsible for the formation of ordered structures in confined emulsions.  A hierarchy of many-particle, computer simulation algorithms will be developed to identify key flow patterns that guide particles into ordered microstructures.  Particle-scale phenomena responsible for the formation of microstructures will be determined by analyzing simulation results and comparing them with experiments under highly controlled conditions.  Although the project will focus on emulsions of deformable drops, the project?s results will apply to spontaneous ordering in other systems with nonlinear particle interactions, such as suspensions of rigid particles in non-Newtonian fluids.  Understanding the fundamental hydrodynamic mechanisms that govern self-assembling microstructures in confined flows could help practitioners design and process composite materials."

This project will use cutting-edge genomic tools to study how genes expressed in the placenta influence the brains and behavior of mothers as well as their offspring. The project focuses on imprinted genes, a group of genes that are critical to placental function and brain development. The expression of imprinted genes depends on parent-of-origin: some are expressed exclusively from the maternal copy, and some from the paternal copy. Disruption of this unusual expression pattern in mouse placenta alters the behavior and physiology of mothers. In humans, imprinted genes are linked to mood and cognition disorders. The research team will use a novel mouse model and classic behavioral tests to assess how and when imprinted genes exert their effects on mothers and offspring. They will also recruit and mentor Native American student researchers, and provide hands-on research experiences for high school science teachers. The teachers will develop lesson plans based on their research, and will enhance their scientific literacy by learning more about evolution, genetics and behavior.<br/><br/>Placental complexity, maternal care, and a highly developed forebrain are defining features of eutherian mammals. Imprinted genes affect all three phenotypes but little is known about how these effects are integrated across tissues (placenta, brain), genotypes (mother, offspring), and development (perinatal, adult). The researchers will assess the role of imprinted genes in these interactions by measuring the effects of placental loss of imprinting (LOI) on mothers, of developmental LOI on embryonic brain and neonatal behavior, and the combined effects of LOI and maternal environment on adult brain and behavior. They do so in a tractable hybrid system, in which potentially opposing effects of LOI for paternally vs. maternally imprinted genes can be enumerated. Effects of placental LOI on mothers will be tested by profiling the behavior, neural transcriptomes (RNAseq) and hormone levels of pregnant females, and the behavior of nursing mothers. In parallel, they will measure expression (RNAseq) and DNA methylation (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) in embryonic brain and placenta, and behavior in neonates. Cross-fostering will separate effects of altered maternal care in mothers exposed to placental LOI, from effects of developmental LOI, on behavior and neural gene expression and methylation in adult animals. These studies will test the hypothesis that imprinted genes regulate the intimate and obligate relationship between mammalian mothers and young, and will advance understanding of the combined effects of genotype, epigenotype and rearing environment on brain and behavior, and the role of imprinted genes in placental signaling and in shaping the adult brain."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models.

This technology, when followed by carbon sequestration, has the potential to have significant impact because it can simultaneously produce electricity and decrease CO2 emissions, using essentially conventional equipment. This process requires a knowledge of ash deposition and heat transfer under biomass oxy-combustion conditions, which are the twin thrusts of this research. The international team assembled consists of the Universities of Utah (UU) and North Dakota (UND) in the US and Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), and  Southeastern University (SEU) in China. <br/><br/>Scientific objectives are to: 1) validate predictions of ash deposition rates during the oxy-combustion of biomass-coal blends; and 2) understand how these impact boiler chamber radiation. The hypothesis, based on limited preliminary experimental work, is that ash deposition rates are linearly dependent on the concentration of sub-micron particles (PM1) in the flue gas. In extending the work to oxy-biomass combustion, it is sought to understand formation of both the inner binding layer and bulk layer of controlled ash deposits, and to develop and apply experimental information to refine existing models for predicting the ash layer build up and submicron aerosol formation. These models will be employed in conjunction with high fidelity radiative property models in computational fluid dynamic simulations of the combustion scenarios. The simulations will be validated through coordinated experiments in both the US and China, at various scales, for various fuels, covering a range of combustion conditions, including experimental validation at both atmospheric and pressurized oxy-combustion conditions. This international collaborative project is expressly designed to provide the fundamental knowledge that will help bring this technology into practice, for both first generation (atmospheric pressure) and second generation (elevated pressure) oxy-combustion technologies.

Accurately determining how much RNA is produced and the structure of that RNA are the goals of this research. Many experiments do high throughput sequencing of RNA to show how much gene expression is taking place, what parts of the genomic DNA are making the RNA, and how DNA regions combine to make functional RNA. There are many steps required to process RNA and get sequence data, leading to a lot of noise in the data. Errors also occur when trying to compare the RNA sequence to a genome sequence that has gaps in it or that was not correctly assembled. The effect of the noise and errors is that calculating how much of each type of RNA is present is not very accurate, which can give misleading results. The aim of this research is to develop methods that overcome the technical problems so that good quantitation and better understanding of biological processes are possible. The new algorithms will be incorporated into software packages available for use by interested members of the scientific community, so that the benefits of the improvements will be widely shared. In addition, better analysis of RNA sequencing experiments is expected to have a positive impact on many scientific disciplines, from basic cell biology to development of clinical tests.  <br/><br/>High-throughput sequencing of RNA has proven itself as an invaluable tool for gene discovery and the annotation of new isoforms for both coding and non-coding genes. However, it is still falls short on its ultimate promise of providing quantitative and comparative measures of transcript abundance. This gap is due to a series of technical factors. Among them are biases introduced by employing an inexact reference genome as the standard for associating sequence data to transcripts, noise due to misalignments causes by paralogous sequence such as pseudogenes, biases introduced by unannotated transcripts, sense/antisense transcript interference, and origin bias due to aligning diploid data to a haploid model. The objective of the project is to develop methods that either overcome or side-step all of these factors in an effort to deliver on the promise of RNA sequencing for quantitative analysis. Our research plan includes developing computational models and efficient algorithms for simultaneous rebalancing reads between genes and pseudogenes and genes within gene families, robust alignment-free methods for estimating transcript abundances and allele-specific expression patterns, and de novo approach for isoform and novel transcript discovery using DNAseq and RNAseq from a single sample. The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

These proofs must be efficiently verifiable in less time and energy than it takes to re-execute the computation itself.<br/><br/>Building upon exciting recent theoretical and practical advances in verifiable outsourced computation for the cloud, this project develops new techniques that exploit the unique constraints and adversary models that relate to the verifiable hardware problem. In addition, the project also develops new practical approaches to the problem of general verifiable computation. As a broader impact, computing systems security is one of the greatest technological problems faced by society today. Verifiable hardware is an essential foundation for building future computing systems that are reliable and free from catastrophic security failures. The ultimate goal of this project is to make verifiable hardware practical and accessible for use in cryptographic and mission-critical hardware applications through open-source tools.

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

This research project uses a similar approach to study a particular class of novel semiconducting materials called transition metal dichalcogenides. Usually, these materials are only a single atomic layer thick and they hold tremendous opportunity for next generation electronic devices, because they can serve in a transistor at a thinness unattainable by silicon while at the same time allowing for optical communication. This method uses sound waves within surfaces - waves much akin to those that shake the ground during earthquakes - to rock the semiconductor thin layers and to study how the charge carriers in them dissipate the energy. The approach provides unique knowledge about the dynamic properties of charge carriers and how free they are to move around so that they can sustain fast electronic applications. The great advantage of this technique is that it does not require fabrication of electrical contacts or attaching wires to the material under investigation. Because the material is so thin, the metal of the wires can have a huge impact on the results of measurements using more conventional techniques. This research explores novel strategies for the integration of these materials into electronic devices. The University of California at Riverside is a Hispanic serving institution with every third student being Hispanic and every other student being the first in the family to attend college. This research project is conducted by a Hispanic graduate student and offers undergraduate research opportunity to UC Riverside's diverse student body.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This research is focused on studying the transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides by applying surface acoustic wave spectroscopy. The method is contactless and provides insight into the transport properties modulations in absence of any perturbation caused by electrical contacts needed for alternative methods. The approach utilizes surface acoustic waves generated and recorded by means of interdigital transducers that are spaced millimeters away from the films under investigation. Optical excitation is used to modify the transport properties of the films at diffraction-limited spatial resolution rivaling that of current photoluminescence and Raman maps. This allows new insight into the spatial variation of transport properties in transition metal dichalcogenide films. The research team explores the impact of grain boundaries, lateral and vertical interfaces, and other material perturbations on the local conductivity. The project is interdisciplinary, combining the preparative techniques available at the University of California, Riverside, with the expertise of an international collaborator from University of Augsburg, Germany. The research is expected to enhance the understanding of carrier transport in transition metal dichalcogenide films with defects, heterojunctions or other local variations. The acquired knowledge is a foundation for design of novel devices that incorporate heterojunctions of such films as functional elements."

Magnetic materials have been an indispensable ingredient for information storage since the advent of the computer age and presently hold great promise for the development of revolutionary new computer and information technologies.  Recent advances in nanofabrication allow an unprecedented precision in building magnetic multilayer structures, using ultrathin films with thickness down to a single atomic layer and a lateral extent down to ten nanometers.  At these very small scales, new physical effects become prominent, driving interesting new phenomena such as spin transfer torque, chiral domain walls, magnetic skyrmions, spin, inverse spin, and topological Hall effects.  This new physics needs to be incorporated into the micromagnetic modeling framework that proved very successful in the previous studies of magnetic systems at larger scales.  This research project explores the multiscale, nonlinear, nonlocal, and often stochastic nature of the new models, which represents a significant challenge to understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems.  A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation of applied mathematicians in this highly interdisciplinary area of research.<br/><br/>This project aims to formulate and analyze models of ultrathin ferromagnetic films in the presence of antisymmetric exchange interaction, which produces a non-trivial interplay with the topological characteristics of the magnetization.  Particular care will be taken to incorporate into the models the non-local effects of the stray field via rigorous analysis of the appropriate asymptotic thin film limits arising from the full three-dimensional treatment.  Within the obtained reduced thin film models, the properties of charged domain walls, chiral domain walls, and magnetic skyrmions will be investigated, using a combination of analytical, formal asymptotic, and numerical tools.  The questions of existence and asymptotic properties of these coherent structures give rise to challenging problems of energy-driven pattern formation and calculus of variations.  The research is strongly motivated by the rapidly expanding field of spintronics.  All the special magnetization configurations that will be considered in the project are currently targets for potential applications in spintronics devices and, in particular, for the development of non-volatile sequential and random access computer memories."

An algorithm audit uses controlled experiments to examine an algorithmic system, such as an online service or big data information archive, and ascertain (1) how it functions, and (2) whether it may cause harm. Examples of documented harms by algorithms include discrimination, racism, and unfair trade practices. Although there is rising awareness of the potential for algorithmic systems to cause harm, actually detecting this harm in practice remains a key challenge. Given that most algorithms of concern are proprietary and non-transparent, there is a clear need for methods to conduct black-box analyses of these systems. Numerous regulators and governments have expressed concerns about algorithms, as well as a desire to increase transparency and accountability in this area.<br/><br/>This research will develop methodologies to audit algorithms in three domains that impact many people: online markets, hiring websites, and financial services. Auditing algorithms in these three domains will require solving fundamental methodological challenges, such as how to analyze systems with large, unknown feature sets, and how to estimate feature values without ground-truth data. To address these broad challenges, the research will draw on insights from prior experience auditing personalization algorithms. Additionally, each domain also brings unique challenges that will be addressed individually. For example, novel auditing tools will be constructed that leverage extensive online and offline histories. These new tools will allow examination of systems that were previously inaccessible to researchers, including financial services companies. Methodologies, open-source code, and datasets will be made available to other academic researchers and regulators.  This project includes two integrated educational objectives: (1) to create a new computer science course on big data ethics, teaching how to identify and mitigate harmful side-effects of big data technologies, and (2) production of web-based versions of the auditing tools that are designed to be accessible and informative to the general public, that will increase transparency around specific, prominent algorithmic systems, as well as promote general education about the proliferation and impact of algorithmic systems."

The host institutions for this fellowship is Iowa State University and the Field Museum of Natural History, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Tracy Heath (Iowa State) and Carrie Moreau (Field Museum).<br/><br/>This project uses the Field Museum's extensive collection of ant fossils to estimate both the phylogeny (evolutionary tree) of ants and the timescale of their evolution. Ants are an important presence in the most terrestrial ecosystems, providing vital ecosystem services of ecological and agricultural relevance. An estimate of the phylogeny of ants forms the basis for comparative studies of every aspect of their biology. The newest methods for inferring the timescale for evolution use the fossil record much more efficiently than previous approaches, making them more powerful and precise than older methods. However, these new techniques have not been thoroughly tested. In this project, the Fellow is evaluating the state-of-the-art methods for estimating the timing of evolutionary events, in order to generate recommendations on how to best perform these analyses. This project will involve building software to analyze the phylogenetic data, which will be made freely available.<br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving advanced training in computational biology, including experience with C/C++ programming and software development.

In the setting of non-commutative geometry where the notion of locality ceases to make sense, these intuitions usually offer little guidance, so that mathematicians are forced to fall back on algebraic and computational tools. The study of symplectic manifolds provides, via mirror symmetry, an approach to non-commutative geometry that starts from an honest geometric space and produces a non-commutative one formed by a class of subspaces called Lagrangians. For example, the algebras known to mathematicians as Clifford algebras and to physicists as Dirac matrices arise from the study of circles in the sphere. This research project will investigate such non-commutative spaces in higher dimensions, relating them to a program whose goal is to understand symplectic manifolds via the associated non-commutative spaces known as Fukaya categories. <br/><br/>The project focuses on the setting of symplectic manifolds admitting Lagrangian torus fibrations. The investigator recently extracted a local-to-global description of the Fukaya category in this case.

The investigator aims to systematically develop these tools, starting from situations where they will provide alternate descriptions of Fukaya categories (e.g., for cotangent bundles).

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org."

Human trash includes plastic, fishing debris, and metal, which have negative effects on marine resources. For example, some trash can be ingested by organisms including birds and turtles, and plastic can break down into small particles that have unique toxic properties. The study of the origins, movement, and consumption of trash in the ocean has provided information about ocean currents and food webs. Research by this investigator has shown that trash in rivers can reach similar densities as in the oceans. However, the sources, movements, and influences on biological systems of human trash in rivers are unknown, and are needed to develop efficient prevention strategies and policies. Also, studying the ecology of trash in rivers may reveal previously unexplored controls on ecosystem structure and function. This study will be conducted in Chicago- and Baltimore-area rivers, and include students from high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Trash removal will be used by student teachers to develop lessons for teaching the scientific method across grade levels.<br/><br/>This research will examine the ecosystem role of anthropogenic litter (AL) in 3 size classes by adapting fundamental tools used to measure communities of organisms and movement of organic matter. First, the role of large AL will be measured. Urban rivers typically have reduced channel complexity due to straightening and flood management. Large AL may act as an ?artificial reef,? providing habitat complexity and organic matter retention that is otherwise lacking, and thereby enhance biodiversity. Researchers will measure stream organism abundance at naturally occurring debris dams (i.e., wood) and at those generated by large AL. Next, this research will quantify interactions between AL and microbes. Bacteria, fungi, and algae carry out important biological activities in rivers, removing excess nutrients and providing food for insects and fish. Initial studies showed AL has unique microbial communities compared to natural surfaces. Experiments will test how microbes are affected by the structural and chemical properties of AL surfaces. Last, movement of intermediate-sized (e.g., shopping bags), and small AL (e.g., microplastic) will be examined. Initial research showed that AL in rivers is abundant and mobile, with some portion always moving downstream. Because AL attracts common toxic chemicals, its movement may be an overlooked pathway for delivery of toxins downstream and into food webs. This work will quantify inputs, outputs, and re-distribution of toxins on litter surfaces in urban streams."

As the key building blocks of current and future computing systems, including the Internet of Things, many-core chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are facing unprecedented power challenges brought on by limits in Dennard scaling. This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication. Among some of the specific lines of research that are explored are alternative topologies and coordinated routing algorithms to enable more efficient power-gating of NoC routers, holistic approaches for exploiting coordination between the NoC and other on-chip system components as well as factoring in key application characteristics, and novel packet-oriented dynamic power control schemes that explore energy-saving opportunities beyond the conventionally targeted low-load traffic region. Beyond its technical contributions that can impact fundamental advancement in dark silicon computing, this research also has impact more broadly on research education and outreach. Findings from this research are incorporated into graduate curriculum, courses, and undergraduate research experiences. Outreach activities to broaden participation in computing of persons from diverse backgrounds and development levels are also featured."

To improve training and increase the number of certified ISA technicians while advancing the role of community colleges in Career and Technical Education (CTE), the college will address emerging ISA needs of industries and organizations. The core ISA certificate program is designed to serve low-income, first generation, and traditionally underrepresented student populations and meet their educational, economic, and career needs, which will model the culture of collaboration and partnership established between the college and regional business and industry, government and workforce organizations, K-12 districts, the community, and four-year universities. Focusing on the expertise of leaders in the field and these partnerships, the project will develop networks to support current and future technical workforce needs, internships, and other aspects of implementation.  It will encourage participation by low-income, underrepresented, and/or minority students including women, with a target goal to increase and improve computer information systems (CIS) education not only at the college, but nationwide. The outcome of the efforts will affect students and instructors from high schools to colleges and universities and will positively impact the growing industries relocating to the region by improving the quality, quantity, and diversity in the workforce available to them, while making small to medium businesses more secure through regular security assessments. Project findings will be widely disseminated as it is designed to build an improved model of internship/work experiences that can be replicable at community colleges and universities nationwide and can be modified in order to meet the needs of individual institutions. A rigorous evaluation process will be employed to enhance the project activities and provide opportunities for researching and determining the success of the project and deliverables.<br/><br/>The project includes student internships and work experiences; experiential learning; the application of knowledge for students; and systems security audits for local and regional businesses and industry. Students will gain soft and technical skills necessary to become highly-skilled ISA technicians in a business environment. The project provides an opportunity for students, primarily first generation or underrepresented, to gain a rigorous education in ISA and participate in relevant information systems opportunities and work experience through internships. The project will also provide faculty members with professional development opportunities to enhance researched pedagogy and teaching strategies in technology disciplines. It will create a blueprint for project improvement that incorporates a new model of success by developing or modifying core and transferrable CIS courses. Building on the foundation of regional workforce needs, the project will improve the training and quality of ISA technicians in the service areas of the college. With student success and employment preparation at the core of the planning and development, the second step will be the development of an Associate of Science (A.S.) transfer degree program in Information Systems (IS) to follow the certificate program."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups under-represented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Zaid McKie-Krisberg is ""A Systems Approach to Investigations of Light Independent C4 Type Carbon Fixation in Green Algae."" The host institutions for this fellowship are City University of New York-Brooklyn College and Rutgers University-Newark.  The sponsoring scientists are Drs. Juergen Polle and Adam Kustka. <br/><br/>The Fellow?s research investigates whether green algae use the C4 pathway for photosynthesis. Understanding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of carbon (C) fixation by photosynthesis is important because C fixation by algae provides organic energy for nearly all aquatic food webs, and because algae photosynthesis can be an important source of biofuels. While there is some evidence that single-celled green algae use the C4 pathway (based on enzyme activity and the synthesis of organic C compounds), complete C4 photosynthetic pathways have yet to be confirmed in these algae, which are the closest relatives of vascular plants. In vascular plants, C4 pathways are associated with either a distinct multicellular anatomy, or with a diurnal rhythm. C4 pathways have been suggested to function as carbon concentrating mechanisms, contributing to pre-fixation of inorganic carbon.  However, in green algae, the products formed in these pathways can also be involved in synthesis of metabolites such as amino acids.  This suggests that C4 activity in green algae could be both 1) a mechanism to facilitate carbon availability for fixation, and 2) a connection between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. The Fellow is exploring the existence of C4 pathway activity and cellular organization in several species of green algae, using a comparative approach that integrates genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, together with metabolic tracking experiments and molecular studies. <br/><br/>The Fellow is being trained in systems biology, computational biology, and applied phycology, while advancing his development towards an independent academic career by publishing scientific articles, learning new techniques, and mentoring/training students. In an effort to broaden participation in science, the Fellow is drawing on the diverse populations at both host institutions to provide training and instruction in cutting edge biological research to students in under-represented groups. The Fellow is training undergraduate researchers, who are receiving training in bioinformatics theory and techniques, including biocuration and metabolic mapping.  In addition, the Fellow is creating a Systems Biology teaching module, which is being made available for public use by educators. In addition, the Fellow?s mentoring and training efforts are preparing undergraduate minority students for successful careers in STEM research."

Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic ""snow avalanches"", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system.  This project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic field.  This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical modeling work.<br/><br/>To date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies. However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable avalanche events.  The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous ongoing theoretical and computational studies."

This research project is focused on establishing novel results and opening new research directions in parameter estimation, prediction, and extreme value theory of multivariate random fields.

Special emphasis is placed on investigating the effects of smoothness/fractal indices and cross-dependence structures of multivariate Gaussian and related random fields on their parameter estimation and prediction under the framework of fixed-domain asymptotics, and on multivariate extreme value theory. Many of the problems under investigation are intrinsically connected with geometric and topological properties of the multivariate random fields. The principal theoretical findings envisaged by this project include simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters and description of their joint performance, prediction under fixed-domain asymptotics, and precise asymptotics for the excursion probabilities, for multivariate Gaussian and related random fields indexed by the Euclidean space or spheres. In previous work, the investigator developed probabilistic and statistical methods for studying multivariate random fields and resolved several outstanding open problems on excursion probabilities, random fractals, Gaussian random fields, Lévy processes, and fractional Lévy random fields.

The first part of the project mathematically describes the phenomenon of acoustic sound waves within a chamber whose flexible walls are allowed to move freely as time evolves. For such acoustic wave dynamics, the goal is to determine which pre-assigned chamber geometries will give rise to an interior acoustic field that is as ""quiet"" as possible. That is to say, because of the analytically pre-determined chamber configuration, the acoustic pressure will be minimized and external noise optimally reduced. The second part of the project focuses on structure-fluid interactions as they occur in nature and engineering, for example the nucleus of a cell interacting with the cellular cytoplasm. In this example, the wall of the nucleus might be described by structural PDE, and the cytoplasm mathematically modeled by fluid flow PDE.  The goal of the project is to develop and analyze more realistic models that comprise both fluid and structure PDE dynamics. <br/><br/>The first part of the project will address the feasibility of stabilizing interior acoustic wave dynamics on a time-evolving bounded domain through the means of prescribing, in advance, the evolution of the geometry. That is, as time gets large, the prescribed moving boundary feedback law should cause the acoustic wave solutions to either decay or approach a certain set of finite energy states. Since the associated wave energy is majorized by wave boundary trace quantities that resemble velocity feedback mechanisms, this ""geometry-control"" problem might be viewed as a moving boundary analog to Neumann boundary stabilization of the wave equation on a fixed domain. The second part of the project will consider linear and nonlinear structure-fluid PDE models in which the structural components are mathematically modeled by physically relevant but quite complex Reissner-Mindlin-Timshenko (RMT) plate systems. By decoupling these structure-fluid dynamics, the associated pressure variables are eliminated in a nonstandard manner, intrinsic to the coupling mechanisms in place. Having resolved the well-posedness, the study will consider an associated optimal control problem that will reveal certain ocular dynamics. In addition, the question of global exact controllability for nonlinear von Karman plate dynamics will be investigated. The objective is to establish the exact steering property with respect to finite energy states of arbitrary size, not only target states within a small neighborhood of the origin. This control process will be simulated numerically and the dependence of the controllability time on the size of the initial and target states will be examined."

However, electric currents in some materials can flow without generating heat if the material's temperature is low enough. Such materials called superconductors are used, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging scanners to create large magnetic fields. The aim of this research project is to discover a magnetic analog of superconductivity, which is called spin superfluidity, and to study its stability at room temperature. Spin superfluids can transport magnetic currents with minimal losses similar to electric currents in superconductors. The nearly lossless magnetic currents may find use in the next generation of computers that employ magnetic materials for information storage and processing. The principal investigator and the graduate students involved in this research develop hands-on demonstrations on magnetism and superconductivity for middle school students that stimulate the students' interest in science and engineering.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The main goal of the proposed research is to experimentally realize a new state of magnetic matter called spin superfluid, which has been predicted to exist in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets with easy plane magnetic anisotropy. The name ""spin superfluid"" stems from the similarity of its properties to those of superfluid liquid helium and Cooper pair condensate in superconductors. In particular, the spin superfluid is expected to support spin supercurrents that transport spin angular momentum over distances orders of magnitude longer than those achievable with spin waves. The goal of this project is to induce the spin superfluid state in thin films and nanowires of ferromagnets and antiferromagnet via injection of pure spin currents polarized perpendicular to the easy plane of magnetic anisotropy. The spin superfluid state can be detected electrically via a unique low-frequency supercurrent mode predicted to propagate over microscopic distances in easy-plane magnetic materials. The scope of work also includes studies of a chiral spin superfluid state induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ferromagnetic nanowires. Stability of the spin superfluid state against thermally induced magnetic vortex formation is investigated both experimentally and via large-scale micromagnetic simulations."

Professor Chmielewski studies how the size and shape of the structures they make can be controlled by changing the building blocks at a molecular level. These nano- and micro-structures may have many uses, such as delivering drugs to different parts of the body or helping to grow new organs. Professor Chmielewski trains many chemistry students who work on this project.  She is working to improve the diversity of the chemistry graduate student population at Purdue University. In this way a new generation of diverse scientists will be available to tackle the technological challenges of the 21st century.<br/><br/>The hierarchical assembly of nanoscale building blocks into micron-scaled functional materials is a powerful strategy for the design of devices for technological applications. The Chmielewski research group has previously used collagen peptide triple helices as building blocks for higher order assembly promoted by metal-ligand interactions.  In this way her group generated a range of unique nano- to micro-structures, including fibers, disks, florettes, cages and 3-dimensional matrices, which are potentially useful for biopolymer delivery, imaging agents, cell culture and tissue growth.  Herein Prof. Chmielewski investigates coiled coil peptides (dimer to tetramer) and disulfide-linked helical bundle peptides (pentamer to hexamer) as alternate building blocks for metal ion-promoted higher order assembly into nano- and microscale materials. Modulating the oligomerization state of the peptide allows the control of the number of assembly signals displayed on the building block and provides the opportunity to design pores within the building block.  The overall goals of this research are to have fully optimized conditions to generate distinct peptide nano- and micro-structures on demand and to develop a clear understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the assembly process."

Motivated by the low overall number of female faculty members, researchers, and students in TCS world wide, the workshop has two goals. The first is to deliver an invigorating educational program to the student participants by inviting leading female researchers to present tutorials of their research topics. The second is to provide an outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from different institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a sense of kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this area by having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers present. The format of this workshop consists of technical tutorials, a non-technical talk, a student rump session, and a panel discussion.<br/><br/>The first four Women-in-Theory workshops were greeted with great enthusiasm both from the participants and from the TCS research community at large. Since the first workshop in 2008, the PIs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback and many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping women become more successful in TCS."

At the same time, as computer technology is increasingly embedded in everyday life, the social science implications are increasingly pressing. Unfortunately, existing research communities and educational pathways provide few opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. The doctoral consortium and associated workshop that this proposal supports will fill this gap, by bringing together doctoral students working in natural language processing and those working in relevant areas of social science. Moreover, participating doctoral students will be paired with faculty mentors in disciplines outside of their current areas of study, thus providing for each student a novel perspective that is likely to be both challenging and inspirational.<br/><br/>Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) is one of the premier annual conferences at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning; it attracts some of the best computational researchers in this discipline. It has also recently made efforts towards outreach to the social sciences, for example by inviting a prominent social science researcher to give a keynote address in 2015. The doctoral consortium and accompanying workshop on Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing, which will be held at the 2016 EMNLP conference in Austin, Texas in November 2016, will continue this outreach effort in a new direction. <br/><br/>Funding will be used primarily to support students in the social sciences to attend the meeting, and they will be given an opportunity to present their current dissertation progress. In addition, keynote speakers from social science disciplines will be invited to the workshop. The invited speakers can then be paired with computer science doctoral students, and the social science doctoral students paired with EMNLP ""regulars"" that have expertise in relevant areas of natural language processing. These mentorship pairings are expected to significantly impact the direction of ongoing doctoral research, bringing natural language processing and social science closer together. Of particular interest is sociolinguistics, an empirical branch of linguistics, where the potential for impact from computational methods looks to be particularly significant.<br/><br/>The Linguistics Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences is co-funding this workshop."

Diatoms will be sampled from different regions of the Southern Ocean, including the Drake Passage, the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean and the Ross Sea and examined to determine the range of genetic variation among diatoms in these regions.   Experiments on a range of diatoms will be conducted in home laboratories and will be aimed at measuring shifts in physiological capacities over many generations in response to directional changes in the environment (temperature and pH).  The information on the genetic diversity of field populations combined with information on potential rates of adaptability and genome changes will provide insight into ways in which polar marine diatoms populations may respond to environmental changes that may occur in surface oceans in the future or may have occurred during past climate conditions.   Such information allows better modeling of biogeochemical cycles in the ocean as well as improves our abilities to interpret records of past ocean conditions. The project will support a doctoral student and a postdoctoral researcher as well as several undergraduate students. These scientists will learn the fundamentals of experimental evolution, a skill set that is being sought in the fields of biology and oceanography. The project also includes a collaboration with the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting that will design and facilitate a session focused on current research related to evolution and climate change to be held at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers (NASW). <br/><br/>Both physiological and genetic variation are key parameters for understanding evolutionary processes in phytoplankton but they are essentially unknown for Southern Ocean diatoms. The extent to which these two factors determine plasticity and adaptability in field populations and the interaction between them will influence how and whether cold-adapted diatoms can respond to changing environments.  This project includes a combination of field work to identify genetic diversity within diatoms using molecular approaches and experiments in the lab to assess the range of physiological variation in contemporary populations of diatoms and evolution experiments in the lab to assess how the combination of genetic diversity and physiological variation influence the evolutionary potential of diatoms under a changing environment.  This research will uncover general relationships between physiological variation, genetic diversity, and evolutionary potential that may apply across microbial taxa and geographical regions, substantially improving efforts to predict shifts in marine ecosystems. Results from this study can be integrated into developing models that incorporate evolution to predict ecosystem changes under future climate change scenarios."

In particular, the sensors will detect the protein aggregates that form in the brain as early as two decades before the onset of symptoms. The ability to detect and track these protein aggregates will not only help in understanding the diseases better, but will also lead to early diagnosis and contribute towards the development of therapies to prevent and treat these devastating diseases. <br/> <br/>Misfolding and aggregation of proteins is a central pathogenic event in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, particularly the pre-fibrillar aggregate conformations that are the most neurotoxic, which is potentially due to a lack of molecular probes that could selectively and differentially target different protein aggregate conformations. To meet this critical need, development of a novel oligo(p-phenylene ethynylene) electrolytes (OPEs) for the direct sensing of the wide set of amyloid aggregates based on multiple ""fluorescence turn-on"" mechanisms is proposed. Compared to existing probes that are of limited clinical use, e.g., Thioflavin-T based probes, OPEs offer many distinct advantages, including versatile and highly tailorable structural and chemical properties, and most notably the multiple modes by which OPEs respond to interactions with ligands. Specifically, the researchers will synthesize and test OPEs for the in vitro detection of protein aggregates prepared from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's associated proteins (Objective 1). Experimental findings will also be synergistically combined with closely related computational modeling to gain a fundamental understanding of OPE-protein aggregate interactions as well as OPE's sensing mechanism. Such insights will be used to guide the rational design and synthesis of OPEs Ex vivo detection of amyloid aggregates in brain tissue sections (Objective 2) and in vivo detection in live Alzheimer's animal model brains (Objective 3). Molecular sensors developed in this project will give researchers the tool to simultaneously and dynamically track the protein misfolding and aggregation process for both in vitro and in vivo systems, facilitating research into the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, the proposed multidisciplinary research will obligate the PIs to train graduate and undergraduates students in modern methodologies required to address important problems at the interface between chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine. The acquired interdisciplinary skills will prepare students for careers in academe, national laboratories, and industry. The PIs also propose an ambitious plan to design and integrate ""Biosensor Design Challenge Modules"" into the core chemical engineering undergraduate curriculum at the University of New Mexico at all levels. The goal of this educational effort is two fold: 1. Improving student retention, particularly underrepresented minorities, and 2. Enhancing student success by providing opportunities for solving open-ended design problems throughout undergraduate education."

Consequently, there is a need for techniques that can cost-effectively measure software correctness to establish a well-founded basis for making judgments about whether software is ready for deployment and wide spread use.  The availability of such measures provides an evidentiary basis  for balancing the rewards of using a software system against the risks of its failure.  This type of evidence has the potential to transform the expectations of consumers of software and to enhance their understanding of software behavior and how to place their trust in that behavior.  Evidence of correctness has obvious value for safety critical software, but more broadly it will help shape how society views software as critical infrastructure and the professionalism that it expects of its manufacture.<br/><br/>This project blends the outcomes of decades of work on abstraction-based program analysis and symbolic execution with recent results in quantifying the solution space of a logical formula.  The project explores novel combinations and staging of scalable non-quantitative analyses, to identify sub-spaces of program behavior that may be erroneous, followed by quantitative analyses focused on those sub-spaces.  This offers an approach to measurable program analysis (MPA) that promises scalability while yielding safe and accurate results.  The project produces theory and tools that realize a variety of MPA, empirically evaluates the cost and benefit of these analyses, and openly shares all results and artifacts with the research community."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship provides an emerging scholar-scientist with an opportunity to investigate the ways in which diverse Black families navigate the racial socialization of their youth in the 21st century. The well-being of Black children in the United States is a matter of grave public health significance. The unfortunate realities of Ferguson, MI, Baltimore, MD, Sanford, FL, Charleston, SC, McKinney, TX, Cleveland, OH, and Chicago, IL, have left many in our society with questions about how to provide youth with the triumvirate ""affection, protection, and correction""  required to optimize their psychosocial wellbeing. Racial socialization (RS) is a process that has been associated with a number of positive outcomes. However, this research has largely assessed Black mothers (of mother-father households), has predominately used survey data, and has focused on retrospective reporting of RS, limiting our conceptual understanding of a crucial parenting practice. This project addresses these limitations, expanding the study of RS in a number of important ways.<br/><br/>The project, entitled the ""Black Family Racial Socialization Project"" focuses on the development of three studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods, from the perspective of both parents and youth. The primary aim of the first study is to use survey and interview methods to elucidate the ways in which Black families representing a diverse structural spectrum (e.g., extended kin, blended families, LGBT couples) prepare themselves to undertake the RS of their children. The primary aim of the second study is to capture the synergistic and bidirectional nature of RS ""in the moment"", by using media (e.g., TV scenes, song lyrics, social media posts) to create and code ecologically-valid, family-level racial socialization conversations. The primary aim of the third study is to prospectively assess how Black parents and Black parents-to-be anticipate teaching their children about race ""in the future"". This study will utilize annual interviews and biannual surveys to monitor how intentions to socialize Black youth (and actual socialization behaviors) change over time, and to elucidate the principal factors that instigate such changes. Together, this research will lead to the development of a more complete conceptual framework that can be tested and instituted in future investigations. In addition, the findings from this research are expected to contribute to the development of effective interventions for Black families."

This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

For example, the nucleus of an atom is formed from a mixture of protons and neutrons.  These protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called quarks and gluons, which give substructure to these particles. The goal of this project is to determine aspects of the structure of the proton and neutron, and how this structure is affected when placed in the nucleus. The experiments focus on how the quarks are distributed in space and in momentum. An on-going puzzle is whether the proton size is not the same when measured with atomic hydrogen and its counterpart, muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in the hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. The project includes measurement of electron and muon scattering from protons to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is study the structure of the nucleon. The ongoing Fermilab SEAQUEST experiment uses Drell-Yan cross sections to determine the ratio of anti-d to anti-u quarks in the nucleon as a function of quark momentum, to study transverse momentum distributions, to investigate the EMC effect, to study quark energy loss in cold nuclear matter, and to investigate the possible existence of dark photons in a parameter region of higher mass but lower coupling constant to ordinary matter. The Fermilab MINERvA experiment provides a complementary view of nucleon and nuclear structure by scattering few GeV neutrinos from protons and from nuclei. At Jefferson Lab, experiments on tritium targets will be run in 2017. The MARATHON experiment, through a comparison of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on 3H to 3He, provides information on the ratio of the proton and neutron F2 structure functions at high x, testing decades old perturbative quantum chromodynamics model calculations.

Antibodies, with their chemical specificity and high affinity are exceptionally suited for bio-specific detection and quantification. However, utilizing antibodies for the direct label-free detection of low molecular weight substances is a major technical challenge.  Professor Conboy is using nonlinear optical methods to develop a highly sensitive small-molecule immunoassay, providing a reliable, label-free method for detecting and quantifying low molecular weight substances. The research outcome is to provide a set of new highly sensitive analytical tools for the purpose of detection of illicit substances and hazardous substances screening. Integrated within the research objectives is the education of both graduate and undergraduate students in analytical/bioanalytical chemistry, which is of great National importance in maintaining the strength of the US economy and the competitive edge of US biotechnology industries.  Professor Conboy is also involved in hands on demonstrations, science fair activities and assistance with setting up dedicated teaching space for science experiments at local primary schools in the Salt Lake valley with the goal of exposing primary grade students to the wonders of the chemical world and to promote teacher training and introducing young people to the potentials of science.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the proposed studies is to implement second-harmonic correlation spectroscopy (SHCS) for rapid single point calibration and utilize the high-throughput capabilities of second harmonic imaging (SHI) for screening and quantification. These complimentary techniques, SHCS and SHI have many inherent advantages over existing approaches.  SHCS has the intrinsic advantage that calibration (binding affinity data) can be obtained from a single concentration of the analyte to derive the Kd (or Ka) in a fraction of the time required by a conventional thermodynamic equilibrium binding isotherm measurement, with the added benefit of acquiring both the association and dissociation rates. SHI has the advantage of high-throughput measurement by utilizing antibody capture arrays.  Both methods are also biologically versatile and capable of detecting any molecule containing conjugated structures, including virtually all biomolecules targeted in current assays. Together these methods represent a unique analytical approach that does not compromise sensitivity and speed yet provides a novel, cost effective, and flexible immunoassay format."

For example, stronger ceramics can be made by using a mixture of three different types of ceramics rather than just one. For technical applications where the transport of heat through a material is important, boundaries (interfaces), where the different types of ceramics touch, may block the flow of heat. This research studies how the interfaces between different types of ceramics change the flow of heat. The goal of this project is to help design better thermal insulation and better cooling systems, for improved energy efficiency and reduced cost. Graduate students and undergraduates will participate in this research, and high school students from low-income underrepresented backgrounds will spend each summer in the lab with engineering students and faculty as part of the pipeline program ""Breakthrough to Engineering"".<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The goal of this project is to understand how interfaces between dissimilar ceramics affect the thermal conductivity of multiphase oxide materials. While the addition of discrete second and third phases can improve mechanical strength, enhance thermal conductivity, and increase thermal shock resistance in ceramics, recent reports suggest that the intrinsic thermal resistance (Kapitza resistance) of grain boundaries due to phonon scattering may limit thermal conductivity at small grain sizes. This research studies the grain size range below which the thermal conductivity is significantly decreased for multiphase oxide ceramics compared to single phase oxides, and evaluates the energy of interfaces and characterizes the chemical/structural disorder between phases to determine correlation with Kapitza resistances using polycrystalline materials and bicrystals. This research provides new insights into thermal transport in multiphase oxides based on the influence of the structure, chemistry, and relative energy of grain boundaries and interfaces. Computational modeling that includes grain boundary specific properties is used to better predict the thermal conductivity of multiphase oxide materials. The results of this research offer improved design strategies for applications of ceramics where thermal conductivity is paramount. Students are also trained on new thermal characterization methods such as the 3-omega technique, and new atomic resolution advanced transmission electron microscopy techniques."

There are more than 100 globular clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy.  The atomic elements found in stars in globular clusters retain the chemical fingerprints of the earliest generations of stars. These elements offer a glimpse into the ways that nature formed stars in the early Universe and produced the heavy elements (iron, uranium, etc.) like those found on Earth today. This investigator will collect and interpret new observational data on trace elements found in five globular clusters.  These clusters were formed prior to the assembly of our galaxy. <br/><br/>Abundance variations among the heavy elements may signal another expression of the multiple populations phenomenon in globular clusters. These variations are not predicted by current models of globular cluster formation and evolution. New optical spectroscopy data collected using the M2FS spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes will settle the issue. The investigator will perform observations that will conclusively confirm or refute previous ideas based on lower-quality spectroscopic data. If confirmed, the community will gain a new tool to guide models of globular cluster formation and evolution. If refuted, the community may refocus its efforts to develop models that fully explain the chemical and dynamical properties of globular clusters in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>This project will also result in the development of a new introductory course that explores the connections between heavy elements forged in ancient stars and the nuclear weapons that have shaped global politics over the last few generations. This course would reach a broad audience of undergraduates at the University of Michigan, including many students who are not majoring in one of the STEM disciplines. The course will introduce students to the role of science in the public arena, articulated specifically through the compelling story of how stardust from ancient supernovae became the key ingredient in the nuclear arms race. This will increase scientific literacy, enhance public engagement with science and technology, and improve the preparedness of future leaders."

The topological model under study would help molecular biologists by simplifying the analysis of the site-specific recombination mechanism for closed circular DNA molecules. The investigator also aims to identify the forms of knots, links, and non-planar graphs that arise in proteins, and to model how these complex structures may have occurred. This information may offer valuable insights into protein folding mechanisms and degradation pathways. Synthetic organic molecules are normally too small to see with an electron microscope; when chemists synthesize a complex structure they use data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide evidence that the molecular structure has a particular form. Since these structures are large enough to be somewhat flexible, both topology and geometry have to be taken into account when comparing the symmetry properties of the NMR data to those of a physical model. The investigator is working with organic chemists to identify different types of symmetries exhibited by complex structures and to design new structures with interesting symmetry properties. <br/><br/>In contrast with knots and links, whose topology depends exclusively on their embedding in the three dimensional sphere, the intrinsic structure of some graphs can affect the topological properties of every embedding of the graph in a given three dimensional manifold. For example, some graphs have the property that for any embedding G of the graph in a three-manifold M, there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of the pair (M,G). Such a graph is said to be intrinsically chiral in M. The investigator will work on characterizing which graphs are intrinsically chiral in the three-sphere and in other three-dimensional manifolds, as well as determining other properties of embedded graphs which are independent of the particular embedding of the graph. The project draws on three-manifold results including Jaco-Shalen and Johannson characteristic decompositions, Mostow's rigidity theorem, Thurstons' hyperbolization theorem, and the classification of Seifert manifolds, as well as techniques from knot theory and the theory of tangles."

In particular, statistical properties of these methods will be studied under linear and Neyman-Rubin high dimensional models, and via analytical and simulation means.

This topic is of broad importance since both the bulk properties of polymer containing materials and the functionality of biopolymers and many polymer-based ""smart"" materials are directly linked to the underlying microscopic conformation of individual polymer molecules.  Many smart or biologically active materials utilize polymer chains tethered to surfaces while biopolymers typically operate in very crowded macromolecular environments. In this geometrically constrained environment polymers can behave differently and a focus of this research is on the basic physics of polymer confinement with specific applications to materials design. This research continues and extends recent work by the PI with significant contributions from undergraduate collaborators in the areas of solvent effects on polymer conformation and phase transitions of isolated homopolymer chains.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to:<br/><br/> (i) elucidate the effects of local environment on the conformational phase transitions of a single polymer chain as relevant, for example, to the design and function of polymer-based environmentally responsive smart materials;<br/><br/> (ii) study single-polymer phase transitions, in particular, polymer all-or-none ""folding"", which can provide an on/off switch in smart materials applications, in crowded or geometrically confined environments; and<br/><br/> (iii) develop rigorous analysis tools such as partition function zeros and free energy landscapes to study phase transitions and transition pathways in polymer systems. <br/><br/>This work will make use of both a solvation potential approach, recently developed by the PI to reduce computational complexity in modeling polymer-solvent systems, and advanced simulation techniques that allow for direct computation of the density of states of classical many-body systems.  The latter methods provide complete thermodynamic information and can be used to carry out subsequent multi-canonical simulations to determine structural information.  <br/>  <br/>This research contributes to the understanding of single-macromolecule behavior through the development of rigorous solvation potentials, density of states simulation methods, and new analysis techniques.  It will contribute to efforts to develop rational design principles for functional polymer-based and biomimetic materials.  This research program has been designed to allow for maximum undergraduate student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at Hiram College.

Thompson.  Professor Thompson is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California (USC).  Professor Thompson's research develops new synthetic methods to prepare conjugated polymers.  Conjugated polymers have emerged as a highly attractive platform for organic electronics and specifically for applications such as solar cells and light emitting diodes.  The current synthetic methods of making these devices are difficult.   These reactions typically require highly reactive and flammable reagents for preparation. These prevailing chemistries also limit the type of monomers to a narrow group, further limiting the range of polymer properties. This research describes a strategy to develop the new synthetic technique for making polymers, Direct Arylation Polymerization (DArP), into a robust, broad-reaching, and enabling platform for the synthesis of conjugated polymers. Professor Thompson?s hypothesis is that through careful control of reaction parameters and additives, DArP can be made to be broadly compatible with a variety of monomer systems and can exhibit selectivity better than traditional methods of conjugated polymer synthesis. The research project also offers a significantly more green and sustainable route to conjugated polymer synthesis.  The research provides training for community college students through the USC-Cerritos College summer internship program. Optimization of DArP and the ultimate scale-up of polymers made by DArP provides a significantly more economical and environmentally friendly way to synthesize polymers for solar cell applications. <br/>	<br/>This research describes Professor Thompson?s strategy to develop Direct Arylation Polymerization (DArP) into a robust, broad-reaching, and enabling platform for the synthesis of conjugated polymers. Motivation for this work is based on the limited methods for conjugated polymer synthesis. While DArP can attractively bypass metalation requirements, it currently lags behind state-of-the-art methods like Stille methods in terms of functional group tolerance and minimization of defects andas Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation (KTCP) reactions in terms of control over polymer growth.  As a result, the major objectives of this work are to: 1. Establish a broadly applicable direct arylation polymerization platform that is both versatile and robust, 2. Develop oxidative direct arylation polymerization for the generation of polymers without preactivation of the monomers, and 3. Refine the DArP platform for enhanced control over polymer growth and compatibility with more abundant metal catalysts.  Professor Thompson?s approach toward achieving these objectives is a hypothesis driven study based on promising observations in small molecule direct arylation.  This methods has theability to not just extend small molecule chemistry but to adapt and develop new polymer chemistry through simple, modular control of reaction parameters."

Metallic nanoparticles in the 10-100 nm size range exhibit unusual properties that enable applications in biology, ranging from diagnostics to therapeutics.  The details of the chemistry at the surface of these nanoparticles matter.  Some surface chemistries promote protein binding.

The position of molecules such as proteins on the surface of nanoparticles can influence the fate and function of these nanoparticles in biological systems. The project also contributes to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of nanotechnology, bionanotechnology, and analytical measurements.  This training provides a pipeline of well-rounded scientists who contribute to the innovation economy.

The long-range goal of this work is to develop the ability to program chemical selectivity in functionalized surfaces, guided by both the chosen metal and active electron storage at the ligand. The team integrates the skills of a surface physical chemistry group with an organometallic chemistry group to develop an understanding of on-surface redox chemistry to produce well-defined surface reaction sites.  These sites are designed to be uniform due to stoichiometric control and to create a repetitive nanoscale structure of the same reactive site in an arrayed metal-organic surface structure. Applying these strategies of ligand design and metal-complex formation to surface functionalization offers potentially transformative impacts in the fields of catalysis, sensing, and carbon recycling technologies. This interdisciplinary project allows new advances in the science of surface functionalization and new insights into redox chemistry processes.  It also provides an outstanding training environment for the young scientists on the project to participate actively in an interdisciplinary research effort.

However, ancient geological events can be difficult to decipher because their physical presence may be lost to erosion. Fortunately, information on the types and ages of rocks (i.e., their provenance) that were present prior to weathering and erosion are encoded in some minerals that are preserved in sediments and sedimentary rocks.  Tourmaline is one such mineral. It is a key repository of geologic information because it incorporates a wide range of chemical elements that reflect the rock environment in which it forms - that is, it encodes the chemical signature of that rock, similar to a fingerprint. Tourmaline is also a chemically and mechanically resistant mineral that, when weathered out of the rock in which it formed, it can become a sand grain that is incorporated into sediments (and rocks). Once it incorporates its original chemical signature, the tourmaline grain stores that signature for millions or billions of years.<br/><br/>This work uses a synergistic approach to decipher former geological events, their record in sediments and rocks, by integrating chemical analyses of the mineral tourmaline using the new technology Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) with the established technology Electron Microprobe analyses (EMP). Both yield in-situ chemical fingerprints: LIBS is advantageous because it collects signals of all elements and their complexes, including the light elements, and provides relative compositions of elements, while EMP is a mature analytical technique and is used for highly precise and accurate micrometer-scale chemical data for most elements (except light elements H, Li). One goal of this work is to use these complementary techniques to develop robust approaches to provenance determination based on an extensive collection of tourmaline samples of known provenance.  The provenance techniques will be applied, in a case study, to the geologic development of the East Antarctic Mountains (650-480 million years ago). The goal of this case study is to test the efficacy of tourmaline analysis by LIBS and EMP in deciphering complex geologic history of East Antarctic.  This study has two major implications.  First, it will develop new avenues of provenance studies to refine our understanding of Earth history using the widespread mineral tourmaline. An additional societal benefit is the potential to differentiate tourmalines from different gem deposits that command radically different prices.  Samples, data and techniques from this study will be used in both undergraduate and graduate classes at two minority-serving Universities to educate the next generation of geoscientists.

This meeting will focus on hydroids, a group of aquatic animals with untapped, but exciting potential for developmental biology and neurobiology research.  Major breakthroughs are made using model laboratory animals (e.g. mouse or fruit fly) to understand basic concepts that will apply to many or all animals.  Traditionally, only a small number of model animals are used by researchers due to the limitation of experimental techniques in non-model animals; this can lead to biases and knowledge gaps.  Recent breakthroughs in technology allow a great expansion in the number of animal models, which will dramatically increase insight into fundamental biological processes.  One such group of interesting, but understudied animals are hydroids.  A small but growing number of scientists have used hydroids to make fundamental discoveries and with newly developed technologies are now poised to make major breakthroughs.  This burgeoning hydroid community will meet at ""Hydroidfest 2016"" to discuss new ideas, learn about new technologies, form new collaborations, and foster community growth.  The meeting will focus particularly on encouraging interactions between experienced scientists and new trainees, with an emphasis on increasing diversity.  This meeting will have a very positive effect on the hydroid research community and will be established as a biennial event.  <br/><br/>Hydroids are exciting laboratory models for making fundamental discoveries in many areas of biology, including development and neurobiology:  1) They have a simple and well-understood body plan that has been key to understanding developmental concepts such as Wnt signaling; 2) They have an informative phylogenetic position: they are in the clade that is sister to bilaterians and therefore discoveries made often reflect deeply conserved eukaryotic processes; 3) Hydroids are transparent, which greatly facilitates live imaging, particularly for recording the activity of the nervous system; 4) The study of colonial hydroids (e.g.  Hydractinia) offers insights into the early evolution of metazoans and the origins of self-/non-self-recognition, and; 5) Hydroids are a great model for stem cell biology and aging, as Hydra has an estimated lifespan upwards of 3000 years.  These topics will be the major scientific focus of this meeting, with an emphasis on bringing new technological approaches to bear on the biology of hydroids, particularly in combination with traditional techniques such as grafting and aggregating cell suspensions into new animals.  Three technology workshops led by experts outside of the hydroid community will focus on: 1) Live imaging; 2) Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, and; 3) Collecting and analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data.  This exciting and informative scientific program will enormously benefit the community of scientists working on hydroids."

When this environment is disordered the wave can scatter along many different paths and this can impair our ability to communicate or to image or excite electronic circuits.  This project will study the propagation of waves through disordered media using a combination of experimental approaches supplanted by theory and simulations.  The effort is a collaboration between the PI and the group of Patrick Sebbah at Bar-Ilan University as part of the NSF/DMR-BSF program.  The work will focus on developing a universal description of wave propagation in finite random media and will provide an excellent training ground for students.  The results of this work will also have a broad impact on a range of interdisciplinary problems in condensed matter physics, acoustics and optics.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>The proposed research extends the range of a universal description of wave propagation from the reflected and transmitted wave at the boundaries of disordered media into the interior of the sample and from samples many times thicker than the mean free path to samples so thin that propagation is nearly ballistic. Phenomenological properties of transmission, such as the extrapolation length, upon which the scaling of transmission depends, will be related to universal parameters such as auxiliary localization lengths of different transmission eigenchannels. These parameters depend only on the ratio of sample length and the localization length and the eigenchannel number. An important aspect of the research is finding the relationship between the transmission eigenchannels, modes of waves in the medium, and solutions of a generalized diffusion equation with a position-dependent diffusion coefficient. The relationship between these approaches provides key clues to the control the wave within random media and disordered metamaterials. Such control of the wave inside disordered media provides a path towards improved imaging, resource exploration, local heating within the body, telecommunications, and low-threshold random lasing. The characteristics of a new class of quasi-one dimensional scattering sample, in which the local density of states vanishes in the interior of the sample, is investigated to understand the relationship of the density of states and localization. This provides new pathways to localizing waves and isolating regions from the surrounding environment."

Examples of these ""patchy"" environments include natural habitats like wetlands and human-managed habitats like agricultural fields. This project will test the idea that the number of different species (biodiversity) that can live in patches of habitat depends on the animals' ability to move between patches, the places where those patches occur, and the amount of food available in each patch.  Understanding what determines biodiversity is important because it allows one to predict and manage especially diverse, often vulnerable, patches of habitat.  Because it is practically impossible to rigorously test the determinants of biodiversity in natural areas, this project will take place in the laboratory. Researchers will create miniature, patchy worlds of very small animals that live in water to study what happens on much larger scales to animals in the real world. Experiments will focus on the relationship between the number of species, their dispersal abilities, and the amount of food available to them in small containers of water.  A complicated model will be built to help analyze the data and extend the results to different animals and different types of habitat patches. The laboratory experiments will also be used in teaching and outreach activities to provide opportunities for grade-school students and teachers to learn scientific methods and ecological concepts through hands-on experiences.  Both students and teachers will help design and carry out experiments, contributing directly to the scientific process.<br/><br/>The investigator will experimentally test whether a common feature of ecological systems -- dispersal among irregularly distributed habitats -- affects the stability of a fundamental ecological unit, the food web. Research will include experimental and theoretical components. Experiments conducted using protist microcosms will test hypotheses arising from network theory that: (1) food webs connected through randomly structured dispersal networks will show greater spatial asynchrony and network-wide stability than those connected in regular networks and (2) effects of dispersal will vary across a gradient in resource productivity, as this factor is known to alter food web stability. Experiments will be integrated with mechanistic models, extending the generality of project findings to broader contexts and advancing general food web theory. The research will also leverage the tractability of protist microcosms to provide inquiry-based curriculum content and student research projects in an undergraduate ecology course.  Students from groups currently underrepresented in science will be recruited and mentored in experimental design, data collection, analysis and presentation. Outreach activities will bring public school teachers into the investigator's laboratory and translate ecological research experiences into lesson plans aligned to Next Generation Science Standards."

Any adjustment to minimize water loss comes at the price of slower intake of carbon. Theory suggests that roughly 20 traits involving plant morphology, physiology, and leaf structure should vary with moisture supply in order to maximize whole-plant height growth and survival. This study will examine all these traits in ten species of Eucalyptus (one of the most widely planted genera of trees on Earth) that differ in their distribution across a rainfall gradient from temperate rain forest to semi-desert in Victoria, Australia. Plants will be grown in four common gardens that span this gradient. Measurements of photosynthetic and water transport capacity will be made regularly and periodic harvests will be used to assess morphology and rates of growth. This project is pioneering for understanding adaptation to moisture supply, because it combines a novel theoretical approach with the use of common gardens to test for potential forces shaping species distributions. This project will train a postdoc, at least one graduate student, and multiple undergraduates. The results will help to understand plant response to prolonged and severe droughts, and distribution in arid regions. A multimedia presentation on Eucalyptus adaptation to moisture supply will be made for public television, and a capstone field course will be offered through UW-Madison and U Sydney that will focus on plant adaptation and community ecology.<br/><br/>Plant survival, growth, adaptation, and integration of roughly 20 traits involving photosynthesis, hydraulics, and resource allocation will be studied in ten Eucalyptus species, stratified phylogenetically and by dominance of successive bands of annual rainfall in Victoria, Australia.  Measurements will be made over two 2-year experiments at four common gardens spanning this gradient. Phylogenetically structured tests of adaptation and functional integration will be conducted, asking whether the observed shifts tend to maximize rates of height growth, whether patterns of plasticity within species in response to moisture supply conflict with those seen across species, and whether species show evidence of adaptive cross-over, with taxa having an advantage in height growth or survival only under conditions similar to those they dominate in nature.  A direct experimental test of competitive success at each common garden will be compared with expectations based on growth rates of uncrowded monocultures and theoretical predictions based on plant traits. The proposed research is novel for studying plant adaptation to moisture supply, in terms of the range of traits whose adaptation and integration will be examined, the use of common gardens to test for cross-over in height growth as support for adaptation and a potential force shaping species distributions, and the use of growth models to identify key traits and trait aggregates that affect plant growth."

A beam of light can put pressure on things to force it to move. Normally, this force is too small to see, but if a laser beam is bright enough and the objects have a small weight, it is possible to see these effects. In this project, we will look at how controlling the shape of a pulse of laser light can make it easier for this force to get electrons moving fast. We will also look at how these laser pulses can make strong waves in a plasma, where the electrons and ions become separated by another laser pulse. Our pulses of light are so short (a fraction of a trillionth of a second) that the ions left behind don't have time to move. The electrons accelerate in the laser pulse like a surfer on a big water wave, where she chooses just the right angle to ride the wave. We hope to show that this can lead to a new way to make beams of electrons traveling near the speed of light. The work should also help us understand how we can use these laser pulses for making small channels and for eye surgery. It will also show us how to convert these pulses to other colors of light. <br/><br/>The research aims to explore using spatio-temporally structured intense laser pulses to control both ionization and electron dynamics in laser-produced plasmas. By controlling the transverse and angular distribution of the frequency components of the beam, we can control the spatio-temporal structure of a pulse. Important for this project, the angular spatial chirp results in an intensity envelope that is tilted relative to the direction of propagation. This gives us control of the transverse group velocity, which can range from super- to sub-luminal. We will use this control to affect the dynamics of electrons and waves in the plasma. In the free electron regime we will test our calculations that predict that with the proper pulse front tilt angle, electrons can be captured and accelerated to the side by the ponderomotive force of the beam. Such a configuration could ultimately be useful for direct acceleration of electrons to the MeV range, useful on their own or as an optical injector for wakefield accelerators. In the underdense and overdense plasma regime, the tilted pulse fronts can enhance the generation of waves in the plasma. In the latter case, we will perform a series of experiments to explore coupling of ultrafast pulses to surface plasmon waves. Our projects closely couple experiment, theory, and computational modeling. The experiments will be performed at CSM with our kHz repetition rate Ti:sapphire amplifier. Computational modeling will be performed with the open source 3D EM PIC program Epoch and with the finite-element Comsol Multiphysics platform."

Nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are soluble, nanometer-scale particles composed of semiconductor materials. QDs can have bright and size-tunable fluorescence, and have current applications in flat-panel displays and in bio-imaging. QDs are also of interest for solution-processable solar cells that can be scaled sustainably to meet worldwide energy needs. However, the performance of QD solar cells remains far below the theoretical limit.  There is considerable variability in fluorescence performance among QD samples of similar size and composition, due to structural differences at the QD surface. It is important to connect emerging analytical methods and theoretical models to the design of stable QDs with desirable surface properties. This project takes a new approach to developing a fundamental understanding of QD structure and chemistry by measuring the heat that is emitted or absorbed when chemical transformations of QDs take place. The ITC approach is expected to be broadly applicable to semiconductor nanocrystal science.  The technique is being used here to advance knowledge that could lead to improved QD solar cell performance. Dr. Greytak's research program at the University of South Carolina engages students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. He has demonstrated nationally-recognized leadership in chemistry education.  He also serves as the head judge for chemistry at the South Carolina Midlands Regional Science Fair for high school students.<br/><br/>Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) are complex assemblies of a crystalline core and an interfacial layer that, given time, may exchange matter with the solution and other NCs. It is highly advantageous to have a set of metrics that allows different NC samples to be profiled, both so that they can be characterized with sufficient precision to predict synthetic and physical behaviors.  It is also adventitious to have a sufficiently rich experimental description of the system to constrain models that begin to capture the complexity of NC-ligand and ligand-ligand interactions. In this program, Dr. Greytak is being supported to measure equilibrium constants, enthalpies, equivalencies, and interaction terms associated with representative ligand exchange and ion exchange reactions at NC quantum dot (QD) surfaces in anhydrous solvents. Purification techniques such as gel permeation chromatography are used to provide QDs in a well-defined initial state. The knowledge acquired from these types of measurements represents a fundamental advance in QD chemistry that hastens the discovery of higher-performing and more sophisticated QD assemblies and solution structures. In particular, the performance and material scope of QD-based photovoltaics can be expanded through improved understanding of ligand exchange and ion exchange reactions. This project also provides research training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, who are building expertise in nanocrystal preparative chemistry, calorimetry, and other analytical techniques that are necessary to advance the field of nanoscience into practical technologies. Dr. Greytak has been active in broadening research participation through the Scientific Advocate Network and the American Chemical Society's Project SEED program. He has also initiated an annual USC Sustainability Research and Practice Showcase that creates a focal point for research groups, graduate and undergraduate students, and staff to educate each other about opportunities for research participation, entrepreneurship, integrative learning, and outreach that advances regional and national competitiveness."

One of the largest structural changes occurring in neotropical forests is the increase in liana abundance relative to trees. This development is alarming because lianas substantially reduce tree recruitment, growth, reproduction, survival, and diversity. In fact, recent evidence indicates that the effects of increasing lianas may be so powerful that they alter the global carbon cycle, which, in turn, has serious implications for continued global climate change. Despite the profound potential ramifications of increasing liana abundance, the causes remain poorly understood. This study will use a series of cutting-edge approaches to address a pressing question in ecology: what are the putative factors responsible for the shift towards liana dominance in neotropical forests. Considering the importance of tropical forests to global diversity and the global carbon cycle, the proposed research is fundamental to understanding the ecology of tropical forests, how these critical ecosystems are changing, and how these changes may ultimately influence global climates. Broader impacts of this research include educational and international capacity building for Latin American students and biologists, and the mentoring of US-based undergraduate and graduate students. Findings of this research will be communicated to the public through both scientific and popular press articles, including articles that feature professional photographic images that illustrate important scientific concepts. <br/><br/>Given the evidence that lianas are increasing in neotropical forests and that lianas have the capacity and propensity to alter tropical forest dynamics, composition, and functioning, the proposed study is urgent and will provide critical data on the rate of liana increases and the putative factors responsible for these increases. Determining the increase in liana abundance in tropical forests will also allow a better understanding of the factors that control tropical plant abundance and distribution, one of the fundamental goals in ecology. Through a combination of approaches (large-scale demographic, fine-scale physiology and growth, and experimental manipulation of multiple factors), this research will identify the liana species in central Panama that are increasing, determine the suite of morphological and physiological functional traits that explain the increase in those species, and experimentally test the most likely factors responsible for liana increases (disturbance, drought, elevated CO2, and nitrogen deposition). By understanding the causes of liana increases, the project will address important basic and applied ecological issues. The mentoring and training of graduate and undergraduate students and biologists from both the US and from Latin America is an integral part of the project."

Moreover, not all species change their seasonal flowering time in response to the same climate factors.  Consequently, as climate changes, some species may flower too early, resulting in exposure to winter frosts, while others may flower too late or fail to shift their flowering enough to reproduce successfully. This project will improve our understanding of how the timing of flowering by individual species and groups of plant species shift in response to future climatic conditions.  This research is essential for forecasting the future availability of floral resources for pollinators and other animals that feed on nectar and pollen, as well as for assessing plant risk of exposure to frost damage, herbivore activity, and other seasonal stresses (e.g., summer drought). To date, however, no comprehensive, continental study of the direction and magnitude of changes in flowering time in response to changes in climate has been conducted.  This project will create a single, large database and make all data available online to the public.  In addition, this project will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Preliminary evidence suggests that the magnitude of phenological responsiveness (or sensitivity) to climate changes may be conserved among closely related and functionally similar taxa.  Consequently, it may be possible to predict the phenology of species that have not been studied through examination of closely related taxa that are well-documented.  Hundreds of thousands of electronic records archived in educational and research institutions throughout the United States provide standardized information about plant specimens collected by botanists across the U.S. over the past 200 years, including the date and location where each specimen was collected and whether it was flowering on the date of collection. This research integrates these disparate records into a single database, and leverages them to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across >1000 well-sampled species.  In turn, this information will be used to forecast shifts in seasonal flowering under projected climate scenarios. Digital herbarium records and recorded in situ observations will be used to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across an unprecedented diversity of angiosperms (>1000 species, each represented by >100 specimens; >400 genera; 80 families).  Predictive models will be generated to enable researchers to forecast phenological changes of individual species given specific climatic conditions."

This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.<br/><br/>Shedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway."

Training in these fundamental topics will also help advance the careers of junior researchers in the physical, mathematical, and biological sciences. The overarching goal is to understand phenomena that emerge in systems with many particles or components that interact with each other. These phenomena are a reflection of the components acting in concert and are distinct from the properties associated from an individual particle or component of the system.<br/><br/>In ferromagnetic materials, with the prototypical example being a bar magnet, magnetism arises at low temperatures, where the tendency for magnetism overwhelms thermal fluctuations.  However, if such a material is suddenly cooled to low temperature, barriers to ferromagnetism arise, leading to the formation of a glassy state rather than the perfect alignment of microscopic magnets across the material which leads to the ferromagnetic state.  A goal of the research is to determine the conditions under which magnetic or glassy behavior arises.  A major focus of the research is the study of dense networks, in which the number of links is much larger than the number of nodes.   An important example is the human brain, which typically has 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections.  The connectivity patterns of these neurons contain a rich spectrum of local motifs that may underlie the wondrous functionality of the brain.  An important goal is to elucidate these fascinating structures. Another focus is to understand the ecological interplay between depletion of an environment by foraging, the nourishment of the forager by resource consumption, and environmental replenishment by resource growth.   An important aim is to determine the conditions under which the forager and resource densities remain in balance and when boom and bust cycles arise.<br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's efforts to develop a massive open online course on topics related to statistical physics.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education that involve applying the techniques of non-equilibrium statistical physics to emergent phenomena in condensed-matter, ecological, and biological systems, with a focus on the brain.  While ostensibly disparate, these projects all rely on common investigative tools, including analysis of master equations, scaling theories, and large-scale numerical simulations.  Training in using these essential tools will also help advance the careers of junior researchers in the physical, mathematical, and biological sciences.<br/><br/>The first project is to understand the dynamics of kinetic ferromagnetic systems that do not conform to conventional power-law coarsening.  Such systems may get stuck in complex metastable states that consist of multiple ""breathing"" domains.  Long-time properties are controlled domain merging - either as isolated events or part of a macroscopic cascade.  The resulting ultraslow dynamics resembles that of glassy materials and should provide new insights into glassy behavior.<br/><br/>A second focus is dense networks in which the average node degree increases with the number of nodes N.  An important example is the brain. Human brains typically have 100 billion neurons, each of which is connected to roughly 1000 other neurons.  The structural connectivity of the brain reveals a rich spectrum of motifs in which small sets of nodes are densely interconnected; such structures may underlie the wondrous functionality of the brain.  These and related features, such as multiple phase transitions in the density of fixed-size cliques will be elucidated by the master equation applied to dense networks.<br/><br/>Finally, a principled model of foraging, which is based on the starving random walk model, will be investigated.  Here the forager consumes food upon encountering it, thereby depleting the resource locally.  Moreover, the forager starves if it wanders for too long without encountering food.  When regeneration and reproduction are also incorporated, an even richer phenomenology arises - the dynamics can be steady or oscillatory, with a large-scale spatial organization of foragers and resources.

Depending on the plant, the number of flowers that form on reproductive branches, known as inflorescences, can vary substantially. Discovering the genes responsible for this species-specific diversity, and understanding how these genes work together to control flower production, is a major focus in plant biology with direct relevance for crop improvement. In tomato and its close relatives in the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, such as eggplant, pepper, and potato, flower production on each inflorescence varies dramatically, from a solitary flower on a single branch, as in pepper, to dozens of flowers on many branches, as in several wild tomatoes. This project will take advantage of variation in flower production found in tomato to study a group of genes that are required for generating multi-flowered inflorescences, and thus the familiar ""tomatoes-on-the-vine"" architecture characteristic of all tomato varieties. By mutating these genes using new gene-editing technology, it will be possible to dissect how the proteins encoded by these genes control precisely when, where, and how many flowers and fruits are produced on each tomato plant. Results from this project should reveal new flower-production genes and their modes of action, which can then be targeted for modification using both classical and modern genetic tools to improve yields in tomato and many related crops. Additionally, an outreach program at an inner-city middle school will educate young students on the process of genetic engineering to help shed popular misconceptions about genetically modified food.<br/><br/>All above ground plant growth originates from shoot meristems, small populations of stem cells that give rise to vast architectural diversity, particularly in inflorescences. At the heart of this diversity lies a critical, yet poorly understood, process of meristem maturation. A major question in plant development is how timing of meristem maturation, and thus inflorescence and flower production, is controlled in different plants. Compared to knowledge on meristem maturation in other model plants, much less is known in tomato and related Solanaceae, despite representing the widespread sympodial growth habit. Recent work in tomato has exposed a new maturation program, defined by a novel transcriptional regulator encoded by the TMF gene. This project integrates genetics, genomics and biochemistry to study the mechanisms by which TMF and its interacting protein partners regulate meristem maturation. In Aim 1, TMF transcriptional co-factors will be studied genetically, molecularly, and developmentally. In Aim 2, transcriptional targets of TMF and its expression network will be explored by integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. In Aim 3, TMF family members will be characterized using CRISPR/Cas9. This project comprises a first molecular mechanistic study to understand how meristem maturation is fine-tuned to quantitatively control flower production in sympodial plants. The findings should reveal new principles of meristem maturation that can enable modulation of inflorescence architecture and flower production to benefit agriculture."

However, ancient geological events can be difficult to decipher because their physical presence may be lost to erosion. Fortunately, information on the types and ages of rocks (i.e., their provenance) that were present prior to weathering and erosion are encoded in some minerals that are preserved in sediments and sedimentary rocks.  Tourmaline is one such mineral. It is a key repository of geologic information because it incorporates a wide range of chemical elements that reflect the rock environment in which it forms - that is, it encodes the chemical signature of that rock, similar to a fingerprint. Tourmaline is also a chemically and mechanically resistant mineral that, when weathered out of the rock in which it formed, can become a sand grain that is incorporated into sediments (and rocks). Once it incorporates its original chemical signature, the tourmaline grain stores that signature for millions or billions of years.<br/><br/>This work uses a synergistic approach to decipher former geological events, their record in sediments and rocks, by integrating chemical analyses of the mineral tourmaline using the new technology Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) with the established technology Electron Microprobe analyses (EMP). Both yield in-situ chemical fingerprints: LIBS is advantageous because it collects signals of all elements and their complexes, including the light elements, and provides relative compositions of elements, while EMP is a mature analytical technique and is used for highly precise and accurate micrometer-scale chemical data for most elements (except light elements H, Li). One goal of this work is to use these complementary techniques to develop robust approaches to provenance determination based on an extensive collection of tourmaline samples of known provenance.  The provenance techniques will be applied, in a case study, to the geologic development of the East Antarctic Mountains (650-480 million years ago). The goal of this case study is to test the efficacy of tourmaline analysis by LIBS and EMP in deciphering complex geologic history of East Antarctic.  This study has two major implications.  First, it will develop new avenues of provenance studies to refine our understanding of Earth history using the widespread mineral tourmaline. An additional societal benefit is the potential to differentiate tourmalines from different gem deposits that command radically different prices.  Samples, data and techniques from this study will be used in both undergraduate and graduate classes at two minority-serving Universities to educate the next generation of geoscientists.  A student exchange between the two universities will broaden their educational and analytical experience, necessary for today?s global workforce. This research team includes two female co-PIs and all PIs serve as mentors to a significant number of women in STEM disciplines.  Collaboration with industry brings together academics and industrial partners including a woman-owned for-profit small business, in addition to collaborations with faculty at another undergraduate-focused university."

This process rapidly led to selection for grains that stayed on the plant, instead of falling on the ground. Now, 10,000 years later, this capacity to stay on the plant until harvest has obvious economic importance. The change from wild grains that fall and cultivated ones that do not is caused by naturally occurring mutations in a normal (that is wild) process. However, the process of shedding seeds occurs differently in different grains. For example, the details of dropping seeds in wild rice are different from those in wild sorghum or wild millet. This project will discover what natural mutations led to the cultivated grains, and whether the natural process of shedding seeds in rice, sorghum, and millet is genetically similar. Because retaining seeds on the plant is the very basis of agriculture, it is an obvious aspect of plants that can engage students at all education levels. Master teachers and undergraduate education majors at Oklahoma State University, as well as undergraduate science majors and local high school students, will participate actively in the observations and data collection required for the project.<br/><br/>Shedding of seeds occurs via a characteristic zone of weakness, the abscission zone (AZ), in which the contents of cells and cell walls are modified to allow a fruit to fall off the parent plant. This project will test whether development is generally conservative, i.e., whether the AZ is produced by activating a conserved developmental program at different times or in different locations, or whether development produces novel structures (in this case, the AZ) by using novel gene combinations. Specifically, recombinant inbred lines and wild accessions will be used to identify genes that contribute to shattering in the model species green millet (Setaria viridis). These studies will be complemented by transcriptomic data on green millet in comparison to Brachypodium distachyon and rice. These investigations will test the hypothesis that some aspects of AZ development are shared among the three species but that many aspects differ because the AZ forms in a different position in each. The investigation will then be expanded to many other grasses, some of which are similar to millet, rice and Brachypodium, and some of which show distinct patterns of seed shedding. The results will define the extent of parallel and convergent evolution in an ecologically and economically critical pathway."

Beyond the appeal of symmetric forms, symmetry can also impart function. For example, orb spiders weave in a spiral pattern to maximize the strength of their webs and bees construct honeycombs with close packed hexagons to maximize honey storage. This correlation between structure and function is also captured in modern nanomaterial design, where changing the symmetry of a nanocrystal or the internal order of a superstructure built from nanocrystals can give novel function. However, the synthesis and assembly of nanomaterials have been limited to simple compositions and structures until recently. In this research, the principal investigator, Sara Skrabalak, is developing new synthetic methods to make metal nanostructures with multiple metals and defined shapes. These nanostructures are also being used as building blocks to form larger structures, where the symmetries of the building blocks direct the shapes of the larger superstructures. The principal investigator and her students also study how the compositions and structures impart functionality. In particular, studies into the new light-matter interactions that arise as a function of symmetry are underway in an effort to achieve multi-functional platforms for chemical sensing applications. Ultimately, this research has broader impacts in the field by forging links between multiple disciplines, including nano/inorganic/solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, surface science, and material science. This project also incorporates outreach and educational efforts that introduce nanoscale concepts to non-scientists.  The project also involves undergraduates in research activities in ways that emphasize their connection to the surrounding community.<br/><br/>The Skrabalak group at Indiana University is developing seed-mediated co-reduction as a new synthetic strategy to multimetallic nanostructures, where multiple metals are simultaneously deposited onto shape-controlled nanocrystals.  The symmetry of the nanocrystal seeds is transferred to the final nanostructures. This research includes studying how lattice mismatch and deposition kinetics contribute to bimetallic distribution. This work is coupled with a study of how symmetry can be reduced along specific crystallographic directions during seed-mediated co-reduction in order to achieve new stellated nanocrystal symmetries and in turn functional diversification. Finally, the Skrabalak group is using the stellated metal nanocrystals to assemble close-packed and low-density lattices to expand crystallization capabilities to new structural classes.  They also characterize the collective optical properties that emerge. These three aims are coupled with outreach and educational efforts in which undergraduate researchers are Science Ambassadors to their former high schools, introducing nanoscale concepts to students and serving as role models to those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Advancement in the research expands the classes of nanocrystals and superstructures possible and identifies the roles of seed and building block symmetry in the synthesis and assembly of metal nanocrystals for broader impact in the science."

The understanding of electronic energy levels has been crucial to understanding chemistry and the development of solid-state materials, such as semiconductors, which have enabled technologies such as computer chips, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.  The logic elements in today's computer chips rely on controlling electron charge and encode information as the presence or absence of charge currents and voltages, but encoding information using electron spin polarization has applications for quantum information processing and potential advantages for improving the speed, efficiency, and energy consumption of logic devices.  Electron spins, however, also interact with nuclear spins, and this can be an undesirable source of noise or, if we can understand it better, a pathway for controlling electron spin polarization.  The PI will use optical measurements with pulsed lasers to characterize how these spin interactions depend on material strain and other parameters.  This research will improve the scientific understanding of these interactions and help us figure out how to control them.  The results of this research have the potential to advance multiple scientific and technological areas, including semiconductor physics, device engineering, materials science, magnetism and quantum information.  The research will provide valuable training to student researchers in a wide range of techniques, including semiconductor device design and fabrication, optical and electrical measurements, data acquisition and analysis and communicating results through scientific presentations and publications.  The proposed outreach and education activities will seek to increase public engagement with recent developments in science and technology and to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific careers.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>The proposed research will investigate electron and nuclear spin interactions in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures.  Controlling the interactions between electron and nuclear spins is of great importance for applications such as classical and quantum information processing, but the understanding of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system is incomplete.  Recent experiments on strained quantum dots have revealed unexpected phenomena, including nuclear spin locking, nuclear magnetization at zero magnetic field, and the anomalous Hanle effect.  These phenomena have been variously attributed to the effects of quantum confinement, mesoscopic size, and strain, but it is difficult to separate these effects in quantum dots and establish the underlying physical mechanisms.  The proposed measurements on strained and unstrained quantum wells will elucidate the role of quantum confinement, carrier localization, reduced symmetry and dimensionality, and spin-orbit effects on electron-nuclear spin interactions.  The nuclear polarization will be monitored using ultrafast pump-probe and spin noise optical techniques capable of sensitively measuring small changes to the nuclear spin polarization.  The proposed research will advance scientific understanding of the physical origins of recently-observed phenomena in strained quantum dots and address open questions about the coupled electron-nuclear spin system and its interaction with light."

Another focus of the project is the iteration theory of holomorphic functions. The PI will study the size, shape and behavior of the Julia and Fatou sets associated to entire functions (holomorphic functions defined on the whole plane). Traditionally, most work has focused on the special case of polynomials; the case of more general entire functions is known as ""transcendental dynamics"", but has  been much  less studied so far.

Successful completion of this work could result in faster algorithms related to meshing, as used in graphics, medical imaging, and a wide variety of design and manufacturing applications.<br/><br/>The project divides into several broad areas: transcendental dynamics, Brownian motion, and the interactions of analysis with computational geometry. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems such as computing the dimension of Julia sets of entire functions, investigating the existence of wandering domains with bounded orbits, and studying the escaping set (points that iterate to infinity). The PI will also work on related geometric problems for random sets such as Brownian motion, considering both well known questions (does Brownian motion cover any rectifiable arcs?) as well as more novel ones (is Brownian motion removable for conformal maps? Does the set of cut-points lie on a rectifiable curve?) Finally, the PI will work on extending his earlier algorithms for optimal meshing, triangulation and conformal mapping using ideas from analysis, geometry and topology. The most interesting generalization would be to three dimensions, where no rigorous complexity bounds are known, but where the most important applications lie.

The aim of this research project is to develop systematic mathematical theory to understand dynamic networks: systems that evolve over time through probabilistic rules. The investigator plans to develop robust mathematical techniques to understand how macroscopic connectivity arises via microscopic interactions between agents in a network. One important direct application is whether a message or a disease is able to reach -- or at risk of reaching -- a significant fraction of the population of interest. Mathematical techniques used to understand such questions have unexpected connections to combinatorial optimization, where one is interested in designing optimal networks between individuals, particularly by considering an important concept known as the minimal spanning tree. The project will also explore swarm optimization algorithms (inspired by the collective behavior of simple individuals such as ants) and their ability to solve hard optimization problems via probabilistic interaction rules through stigmergy (where the network of interacting agents changes the underlying environment which then effects the interaction of the agents). An important component of the project is involvement of students at all levels, including the development of undergraduate research seminars and research projects. <br/><br/>Understanding the metric structure of the giant component and the critical scaling window in inhomogeneous random graph models has been daunting, yet for several decades the community of combinatorial probabilists has seen it as key to understanding more complicated strong disorder systems. The project aims to develop a unified set of tools through dynamic encoding of network models to understand the metric scaling of the internal structure of maximal components in the critical regime. The investigator plans to show convergence to continuum limiting objects based on tilted inhomogeneous continuum random trees and in particular to prove universality for many of the major families of random graph models. Scaling exponents of key susceptibility functions in the barely subcritical regime will be studied. The relation between metric structure of components in the critical regime and the entrance boundary of Markov processes such as the multiplicative coalescent will be explored. The entire program is the first step in understanding the minimal spanning tree on the giant component under strong disorder. These models have spawned a wide array of universality conjectures from statistical physics. The project will also study optimization algorithms and meta-heuristics inspired by reinforcing interacting particle systems and stigmergy, providing qualitative insights and quantitative predictions on hard models in probabilistic combinatorial optimization."

The arc is home to about 145 volcanoes of which 52 have erupted in historic time.  The eruptive activity of these volcanoes ranges from continuous small explosions to devastatingly large eruptions such as the one that occurred at Katmai in 1912. Volcanic activity in the Aleutian Arc is a result of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate. During this process, volatile elements such as water, carbon and nitrogen that are locked up in the sediments and oceanic crust are slowly transferred into the region deep under the Aleutian Arc volcanoes.  Under high pressure the volatiles are squeezed out of the subducting plate into the overlying (mantle) region, where they help to melt rock and generate magma.  The lower density of the magma and volatiles compared to the surrounding rock allows these fluids to ascend to the Earth's surface where the magma ultimately erupts through volcanism and the gases are released to the atmosphere.  While it is well-known that volatiles play a significant role in both generating magma and influencing eruption explosivity, it is currently not well understood how the source of volatiles (subducted plate, mantle and crust) and the amount of volatiles released over time (e.g. their flux), may influence volcanic eruption size, explosivity and frequency. This project aims to constrain the process of volatile subduction and release through volcanism in the poorly studied Western Aleutians, and to provide insight into volcanic activity. <br/><br/>The Western and Central portions of the Aleutian Volcanic Arc are the ideal locations to investigate the influence of subduction angle, rate and sediment composition on magma generation and volatile flux. The subduction rate and sediment flux increases along the arc from Kiska, the western-most volcano, to Cleveland, located within the central region of the arc. Additionally, the number of historic eruptions within Central Aleutian volcanoes appears to be greater in number than compared to the Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through a previous expedition volcanic gas samples, gas emission measurements and explosively erupted lava samples were collected at five Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through this project these samples will be analyzed for their chemical and isotopic composition and measurements will be used to compute the fluxes of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen and water to the atmosphere. Constraints on the quantity and type of material subducted into the Aleutian Arc from previous studies will be compared to the composition of volatile and lava outputs, as well as the total flux of volatiles measured here, to provide insight into volatile cycling and magma generation. This information will be compared to historic data on eruption size, style and frequency for each of the target volcanoes to identify possible links between subduction character and volcanic activity, to ultimately help improve eruption forecasting and hazard mitigation."

This project utilizes a series of chemically flexible nanomaterials to enable compositional control of structural features directly involved in energy-transfer processes relevant to light upconversion. The goal is to establish a series of crystallochemical principles that create the basis for the rational design of upconverting nanocrystals with optimized energy-transfer pathways through a systematic analysis of composition-structure-luminescence relationships. This project involves solution-phase synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals with controlled chemical composition and size, evaluation of their crystal structure using a combination of multiple spectroscopic techniques (X-ray diffraction, X-ray total scattering, and X-ray absorption), and thorough study of their light upconversion properties using spectrofluorometry (steady-state and time-dependent)."

Several composite products containing nanomaterials are also being introduced into a consumer market. However, developing new Nano products, while ensuring safety of consumers, is a very critical task to safeguard competitive and sustainable development of the US nanomanufacturing. The objective of this project is to address the knowledge gap in stability and rate of release of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated in polymers under the influence of environmental factors. This information will be vital in designing stable and safe nanocomposites while reformulating the ones potentially posing the health risks. <br/><br/>Polymer materials reinforced with these nanomaterials are now at the verge of transforming many industries. These new nanocomposites benefit from   many unique properties of CNTs, which can deliver extraordinary stiffness, reduction in weight, increased strength and resilience. Although CNTs are considered potentially hazardous, they are often viewed as safe when encapsulated into the polymer matrix. However, systematic research to confirm the abovementioned paradigm is lacking, despite the potential risks of released nanomaterials to human health and environment. Our preliminary data indicate that there is substantial degradation of CNTs -polymer composites due to exposure to environmental factors, especially UV radiation and moisture, leading to potential pathways for CNTs release. In the proposed research the PI will conduct a systematic study of stability of nanocomposites exposed to single and multiple environmental factors, while accurately quantifying the rates of nanomaterials release. A very distinct aspect of the proposed research is a comprehensive evaluation of nanocomposites in terms of their performance and functionality (mechanical testing), long term stability (environmental exposure and spectroscopic/microscopy characterization) and toxicity measurements. These three aspects will give an unprecedented level of detail to evaluate environmental and health risks of nanocomposites with the most promising functional properties. <br/><br/>This project will significantly impact nanotoxicology, environmental engineering, materials science and green chemistry/engineering areas through evaluation of various strategies for delivering functional nanocomposites with reduced health and environmental impacts.

They will also make a notable contribution to ensuring the competitiveness of the US nanomanufacturing industry. During the course of this project students will gain fundamental and applied knowledge in many areas of science and engineering encompassing environmental health and safety of nanotechnology.

Different ways of viewing solar flares include X-rays, radio and chromospheric spectral lines. A large percentage of flares are recognized as a result of associated brightening in the visible light spectrum, and thus are called white-light flares. White-light emission is a signature of large solar flares and can be observed even on other stars. Though the white light emission was the first manifestation of a solar flare ever detected, in the famous so-called Carrington event of September 1, 1959, its origin is still not understood.  This study will compare observation and modeling of the heights in the solar atmosphere where the white-light and hard-X-ray flares originate and through this be able to elucidate and distinguish between competing flare generation mechanisms.  In this way, the investigation tackles fundamental issues related to flare energy transfer in the lower solar atmosphere and the results will provide important information about the generation, energetics and dynamics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, providing crucial understanding of the initiation of space weather events. The research effort will also have major consequences for the study of flaring stars, since the same acceleration and radiation generation processes are at work. These stellar flares are detected in white light, but hard X-ray emission from accelerated electrons is too faint to be directly measured. The results from this effort will better define the relationship between white light and hard X-ray emissions from solar flares.   This information, in turn, will aid the investigation of stellar flares, including particle acceleration and atmospheric conditions of flaring stars.<br/><br/>It is puzzling that the actual mechanism by which solar flares generate white-light  (WL) continuum radiation in the lower atmosphere is not better understood.  The association of WL continuum with the impulsive phase of a solar flare, that is, the phase in which particles are accelerated,  has been interpreted as an indication that non-thermal particles accelerated in the corona can penetrate deep into the lower solar atmosphere, heating those layers and causing intense WL emission. However, flare-accelerated electrons hitting the chromosphere have relatively short collisional ranges, and so their ability to penetrate deeply, as indicated by the close correlation of WL and hard X-ray (HXR) time profiles, is surprising. Other methods of generating the observed WL continuum include energy deposition by protons (instead of electrons) or ""radiative back-warming"" by the UV or X-ray continua. Alfvenic wave transport of energy could also be significant, as could recombination radiation in the chromosphere. Comparison between the heights of WL and HXR emissions in the solar atmosphere will support or rule out many of these proposed generation mechanisms, thereby providing a greater understanding of WL flare generation as well as the overall energetics of solar flares.   The main objective of this study is the determination of the heights in the solar atmosphere of white-light and hard X-ray (HXR) sources for a large sample of flares. Both absolute heights in the solar atmosphere and heights of the two types of emission relative to each other will be studied. The observed heights will be compared with the results of theoretical modeling performed via the radiation hydrodynamic model RADYN and the 3D radiative MHD model RADMHD. The derived heights and model comparisons will reveal in which layers of the outer solar atmosphere WL flare sources originate and will provide new insight into the generation of WL flare emission, an important and poorly-understood problem in solar physics. Source heights will be determined using data from the HMI instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft (for white-light sources),  the RHESSI (for hard X-ray sources), and the EUVI instruments on the twin STEREO spacecraft, as context data, in order to provide an alternate viewing angleand thus precise height measurements. The ground-based GONG++ network will be used to validate the modeling results. Multiwavelength observations from the ROSA and IBIS instruments will be used to characterize white-light flare energetics."

Temperature depth-profiles are of particular current interest for estimating basal temperature and geothermal heat flux in Antarctica. Antarctic geothermal heat flux is presently poorly known except at recent drilling sites, and is the largest unknown in determining basal conditions. However, current logistical costs greatly limit drilling to acquire temperature profiles. Our long-term goal is the development, testing and commissioning of a new means of acquiring englacial temperature profiles at much lower costs than existing methods. To that end, we will undertake laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to develop to a new way to use ice melt probes, rather than traditional drilling, to deploy temperature measurement equipment to depths of a kilometer and greater. To use melt probes for this purpose, we must keep the melted ice above such probes from freezing completely, so that cable can be fed continually down to the probe as it descends. This development will also open the way toward recovering melt probes, so as to prevent environmental impacts and expense of equipment left in the field. Our initial experiments and modeling will test the validity of our approach and make it ready for further testing in the field.<br/><br/>Technical Description: We will undertake laboratory and modeling work (1) to reduce the technical risk in our approach to melt-probe deployment of Raman Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables; and (2) to begin development of a recoverable ice melt probe. Specifically, we will use numerical modeling of the Stefan problem with cylindrical symmetry to guide detailed designs for cable-heating and anti-freeze injection, and will test and revise candidate designs by means of laboratory testing. We will test the long-term stability of ethanol-filled melt holes, to gauge their suitability for recoverable melt probe systems for temperature measurement (where months-long thermal equilibration after installation will be required). We will gain experience with Raman DTS methods by employing DTS to measure critical temperature data in our laboratory experiments, both within the melt hole and in adjacent ice. To address recoverability, we will design and test a new melt head for the upper end of our ice melt probe, and demonstrate upward travel through a partially refrozen melt hole. Finally, we will publish both modeling and experimental results in peer-reviewed publications, and will present the project to a broad public audience in a special event at a Seattle museum of science and technology. The result of this work will be demonstrated technical readiness for testing in a subsequent project at larger ice-drilling test facilities at the earliest opportunity (prospectively, at the University of Wisconsin, following soon after completion of this project) and, following that, in the field."

In an effort to not only ensure that these systems are available to researchers for their work but to also ensure that that they are properly maintained and available to the entire science community with expert support, NSF created the East Coast Winch Pool. This ?pool? was created to offer scientists a convenient single point of contact for all of their overboarding equipment needs as well as the expertise to provide them with creative engineering solutions for their unique requirements while at the same time reducing cost by pooling equipment for use by the scientific community.<br/><br/>In 2009 NSF assigned the operation of the East Coast Winch Pool to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The range of responsibilities included:<br/>?	Single point of contact for overboarding systems<br/>?	Act as a center of expertise in winch use, maintenance and engineering support<br/>?	Provide portable winch systems in support of oceanographic research<br/>?	Provide expertise in tension member spooling for both portable and shipboard<br/>?	systems and the personnel to operate spooling equipment<br/>?

The MIP workshop is held annually in North America and is designed to encourage participation of junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. A primary focus of this workshop is to showcase young researchers, and to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career, which is especially helpful given the very long refereeing and publication process in mathematical programming. The workshop consists of a single track of 23 invited talks, with about one half of the speakers being junior faculty/postdoctoral fellows, as well as a well-attended student poster session. The workshop also provides an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. A goal of the MIP workshop is to keep the cost of attending as low as possible to encourage participation of underrepresented and minority students, and junior researchers. This award will help accomplish that goal.<br/><br/>The award will encourage broader student attendance at MIP 2016. There will be approximately 25 student posters presented at the workshop. The requested funding would provide $500 in travel funding for 10 of these presenters. These travel grants will be awarded through a competitive process and thus receipt of these travel support will be considered an honor by the recipients. Applications will be evaluated by the program committee. Selected students will have the opportunity to attend the conference and present their poster at the MIP workshop's student poster session. The MIP workshop's student poster session is a great way for students to showcase their work to established researchers in integer programming. These sessions are traditionally well attended and serve as a spring board for networking. The interaction between the student poster presenters and established professionals (from both industry and academia) will benefit students' careers. The MIP workshop's poster session encourages students to engage in high quality research methods and to develop effective writing and communication skills. In addition, there is also an award for the best poster presented by a student."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to engage in research and training that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Chris A. Hamilton is ""Broadening Participation of Native Americans into Collections-Based Research: Testing Hypotheses on the Hawkmoth-Bat Evolutionary Arms Race."" The host institution for this fellowship is The University of Florida and The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Akito Kawahara and Dr. Charles Cobb.  <br/><br/>The Fellow's research focuses on the evolution of morphological diversity in hawkmoths, a species-rich group of insects. This research enhances our understanding of how evolutionary pattern and process produced Earth's diversity, a key question in biology. Hawkmoths are large, charismatic moths that are strong, fast fliers, with a diverse array of forewing shape variation and body size, yet few studies have investigated the drivers of this spectacular morphological diversity. Between 50-60 million years ago, major evolutionary lineages of echolocating bats emerged, along with a large radiations of the Macroheterocera, a group of moth species that includes the hawkmoths. The Fellow is testing the intriguing but unexplored hypothesis that differences in hawkmoth wing shape and body size are associated with the diversity of their primary nocturnal predators - bats. This idea challenges the conventional hypothesis that moth diversification was driven by plant evolution (because plants are their food source). Across the approximately 1,500 species of hawkmoths, anti-bat traits can be found which include ears keen to a bat's ultrasonic echolocation and ultrasound-producing organs that ""jam"" bat biosonar. The fast flight of hawkmoths, also thought to be an anti-bat trait, likely provides the ability to escape predators and cover large distances as adult hawkmoths seek out food for themselves or host plants for their larvae. These extended periods of flight would render hawkmoths vulnerable to predation by bats, putatively providing a strong selective force that led to evasive anti-bat traits, diverse body sizes, and wing shapes able to support acrobatic evasive flight; however, no one has tested this hypothesis in a phylogenetic context.<br/><br/>The proposed project promotes the participation of Native American students in biology by using exciting research questions and an interactive learning approach to characterize hawkmoth wing shape, investigate the historical evolutionary sequence of anti-bat traits, and test for correlations between these traits and extant diversity. The Fellow is engaging middle and high school students from The Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, by utilizing museum collections at the FLMNH to answer fundamental hypotheses regarding patterns of diversity - effectively linking two of NSF's missions: increasing minority participation and increasing the utility of biological collections. This collaborative research introduces the students to the usefulness of natural history collections (students gather morphometric data on hawkmoth wing shape and body size), demonstrates how researchers can use these resources to answer fundamental biological questions, and sparks students? interest in evolution. In addition, Chickasaw Nation students are being exposed to their own cultural history during summer trips to the FLMNH; during this time they work in the collections, assist in DNA extraction and preparation for sequencing of hawkmoth species, and importantly, discover the history of their Chickasaw ancestors through interactions with archeological artifacts."

These ants are ecologically important members of desert and forest ecosystems throughout the southern US and tropical regions of North and South America. Understanding these organisms informs us how they influence and interact with their environment. Detailed studies and experiments in this project have important societal and scientific benefits. For example, some ant-fungal symbioses are important agricultural pests.  Others are sources of antibiotics and antimicrobial compounds, while others serve as models for biofuel production. This research will train undergraduate and graduate students in experimental biology, microbiology and the analysis of large molecular datasets as well as increase the national and international exposure of students at a regional university in east Texas. Outreach activities include but are not limited to (a) construction of a living leaf-cutter ant exhibit at a local museum, (b) construction of interpretative exhibits in the UT Tyler Nature Preserve (c) the development of new courses at UT Tyler that emphasize connections between the environment, biomedicine and human health (d) participating and co-organizing the annual UT Tyler Darwin Day. <br/><br/>Symbioses (ecological associations of unrelated organisms living in close proximity) were and are crucial to the evolution and ecological success of all life on earth.  One of the central issues facing the study of symbiosis is elucidating how symbioses are organized and function in a dynamic world. Fungus-gardening (attine) ants form an obligate macrosymbiosis with specific fungi that the ants grow for food, but also interact with a number of other bacteria and microfungal species. The attine symbiosis is an excellent model to address functional relationships because the ants and fungi can be experimentally disassembled and reassembled into novel combinations, thus making it possible to demonstrate links among colony and fungal performance and microbial community composition. Of particular interest in this project is the roles that the microbial communities (microbiomes) associated with attine ants and the fungi play in the maintenance of the ant-fungus community.  The proposed experiments will examine how interactions with the microbiomes promote specificity and homeostasis with the various partners  in this symbiosis. This discovery-based research will combine intensive field surveys, next generation sequencing, bioinformatics and experimental biology to examine the role of the bacterial communities in conferring stability between host ants and symbiotic fungi.  As a result, this research has broad implications for understanding the evolution and maintenance of obligate symbioses."

Examples range from the shapes of complicated molecules, such as proteins and enzymes, to the configurations of the solar system. In mathematics, Teichmueller theory is the study of the shapes that a surface can assume. In this project, surfaces, their geodesics (shortest paths), and their evolution will be studied in two different settings. In the first, the surfaces have a geometry in which they are flat and so have zero curvature. In the second, the surfaces have negative curvature. Results of the project will deepen and extend understanding in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>This project addresses questions in a wide spectrum of mathematics, including the fields of complex analysis, dynamical systems, geometry, and topology. Important examples of dynamical systems are interval exchange transformations and flows on translation surfaces. Important aspects of these dynamical systems are ergodicity and counting problems. The properties of an individual translation surface are intimately related to the study of the moduli space of all translation surfaces. The project concerns questions in both these subjects. The investigator plans to continue study of the mixing properties of the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. Knowledge of this flow will greatly expand our understanding of the geometry of Riemann surfaces. A fundamental object in topology and geometry is the mapping class group of a surface; the project aims to further understanding by studying the lattice counting problem for the mapping class group acting on Teichmueller space."

Urban water provision is an assemblage of water vendors, networked pipes, plastic jugs, standpipes, water meters, rainwater and greywater collection tanks, and water trucks that convey and manage domestic water provision to help households cope and meet needs of everyday life. This project examines how and why urban households obtain water through these hybrid infrastructure systems and tests their efficacy in terms of household water security, defined as reliable, adequate and affordable water for a healthy life, using a scaled metric developed by the investigator. The project will be conducted in metropolitan Fortaleza, Brazil, where domestic water provision reflects typical configurations of water provision in the developing world.  Research outcomes will provide meaningful insights as to the benefits and limitations of hybrid water-provisioning systems and inform development interventions, technological innovations for water provision, and infrastructure investments. Investigators will create a publicly available online portal to disseminate project information and photos, research findings, and a computational tool to standardize the household water security metric for cross-regional comparisons, allowing researchers to examine impacts of household water insecurity on diverse areas such as public health and water infrastructure planning. The project will also deepen research networks between Brazilian and US researchers, broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science through its research design, and contribute to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce by training one computer science undergraduate and one geography graduate student. <br/><br/>The emergence of regulated and unregulated water provisioning systems begs the question of its efficacy for human development and water security: Do hybrid urban water systems increase or decrease household water security? What particular configuration of formal and informal technologies and practices enhances or reduces household water security? How do different hybrid water-provisioning systems compare in terms of household water security? The major social scientific contribution of this project is to answer these questions by employing a mix of qualitative (observation; open-ended and semi-structured interviews), participatory (photovoice), and quantitative (survey) methods. The investigator will describe and develop a typology of water provision, assess how households interact with the existing systems, and measure household-level water security in selected urban communities. The household water security metric calculated from the survey data can be used to statistically test and model the relationship of water insecurity to several factors, including water-provisioning type, income, education, and health. This project will provide new empirical data to engage larger theoretical debates on the benefits of coexistence, the efficacy of centralized, piped water networks as the modern ideal of water provision, and urban water governance, more broadly."

RME of bioparticles is a highly complex and multiscale process, which is difficult to investigate through scale-specific techniques (both experimentally and numerically). The goal of this three-year project is to establish an interdisciplinary research program in investigating RME of bioparticles through multiscale modeling and simulations. The research objectives are: 1) to develop a 3D mesoscale stochastic model for binding and internalization of bioparticles, the mesoscopic model is a combination of a stochastic binding model with a mesoscopic membrane model based on the discretization of Helfrich Hamiltonian on a curvilinear space using Monte Carlo method; 2) to implement coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular events in RME and then develop the multiscale model by coupling the atomistic simulations with the mesoscopic model through sequential and concurrent methods; and 3) to perform free energy calculations using our multiscale model and investigate the effects of particle size/shape, ligand density/type, as well as the molecular interactions on the overall process of RME, and explore the applications in brain drug delivery across blood-brain barrier and herpes simplex virus prevention.  The multiscale model will provide a unified and coherent description of the process by accounting for effects from both mesoscopic and atomistic effects. The simulations will bring critical, new insight and a deeper understanding of the mechanism of RME.  Innovations of the proposal include: 1) the integration of atomistic simulations with mesoscopic model, 2) the combination of the membrane model with the stochastic binding model that enables exploration of endocytosis with extreme deformations and 3) the coarse-grained force field in atomistic simulations that enables the capture of structural (conformational) information for protein-protein interactions during RME. The multiscale models, together with the free energy calculations, create natural links between different functional biological scales and enables direct and indirect correlations between modeling results and experimental data.  Findings will have broad scientific and technological impact in the fields of virus infection and intracellular/transcelluar targeted drug delivery using nanocarriers, nutrition uptake, contrast-based imaging and cancer progression/metastasis and results may lead to a rational design and engineering for effective drug delivery, and novel strategies for viral intervention and inhibition. The students supported by the grant will have opportunities to receive a unique interdisciplinary training across the mechanical engineering and bioengineering, learn the cutting-edge multiscale numerical modeling techniques, which enable them to become leaders in the bio/nanotechnology field. The involvement of under-represented minority students will be coordinated with existing LSAMP and SWE programs. The findings from the proposed research will be broadly disseminated to K-12 students through outreach activities in WSU and collaboration with local science center, including participation in summer camps and creation of a 3D visualization platform for interactive exploration and modeling of biomolecular events with atomic-scale resolution."

In particular, the UK government has identified synthetic biology as a national strategic research area (funding it with over £50m to date, https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/synthetic-biology-leadership-council) and has produced a Synthetic Biology Roadmap for the UK (http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/publications/reports/syntheticbiologyroadmap/). In fact, it can be argued that the US and UK have the largest research programs in these areas. Collaborations between these two countries in this area are essential to success. The UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and NSF have very recently initiated a joint funding effort that in particular includes synthetic biology (http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/filter/nsfbio-lead-agency-pilot/).

In addition, they exhibit a wider variety of electronic and optoelectronic properties compared to graphene including many being semiconducting or metallic.  This wide range of transition metal dichalcogenides allows one to select a material or a combination of materials best suited for a particular application.  Indeed, by combining different 2D materials together in vertical heterostructures an even wider range of new device functionalities can be enabled.  This collaborative research program will create new educational and research opportunities at both the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program will strongly emphasize the training of graduate and undergraduate students from underserved groups, thus preparing them for industrial or academic careers. This workforce training, along with the expected research output, will boost the efforts to make our nation more competitive.<br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this collaborative research program is to study layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials and heterostructures for device applications, using a combination of controlled heterostructure fabrication techniques, scanning probe microscopy, and electrical transport measurements.  Similar to graphene, the most widely studied two-dimensional material, transition metal dichalcogenides represent a larger class of layered materials with varying electronic properties, from semiconducting to superconducting. The diverse set of electronic properties in these materials makes them suitable for applications ranging from transistors to chemical sensors or photodetectors. Key to an understanding of their fundamental electronic properties is the role of the disorder potential, interfaces, and edges in individual layers, and of the band and rotational alignment in heterostructures.  Specifically, the proposed effort will (1) measure band-alignment in transition metal dichalcogenide based heterostructures, (2) realize heterostructures of two-dimensional materials with controlled rotational alignment, (3) explore the impact of rotational alignment on the electronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures, and using these ingredients (4) design and fabricate novel heterostructure tunneling devices.  This program builds on the PIs existing collaborative research and recent preliminary data on the fabrication and characterization of these heterostructures.  The outcomes of this research program will include uncovering fundamental electronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenide-based heterostructures, new methods to create heterostructures, and novel devices for future electronics applications."

The recent change in NEON management provides an opportunity for evaluating aspects of the Observatory's infrastructure as it relates to the achievement of the Observatory's goals. Through consultation with NEON's new management, this project will plan and implement two workshops to identifying immediate improvements in the current cyberinfrastructure (CI) architecture, and provide a foundation for framing community involvement in designing a cutting-edge, evolvable framework for the NEON CI.<br/><br/>With the selection of Battelle to assume management responsibilities of NEON, NSF views this as a prime opportunity to evaluate the CI needs of the NEON project and align them to support the data products and other IT requirements of the project. A major goal is to update the framework of NEON's CI and put in place an architecture that is evolvable. Plans are to engage Battelle and the expertise it brings to the project in the evaluation of the CI requirements of the project. Participants in the workshop will engage in open discussion of issues and opportunities, identify constructive approaches towards enhancing NEON's CI, and provide suggestions about how to best maintain a CI framework that can be optimized to meet the community's needs over the life of the project. Outcomes of the workshop include several deliverables that will inform management and the community of stakeholders as the project moves into this new phase."

Hypotheses to explain how the ocean regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide have long been debated, but they have proven to be difficult to test.  Work proposed here will test one leading hypothesis, specifically that the ocean experienced greater density stratification during the ice ages.  That is, with greater stratification during the ice ages and slower replacement of deep water by cold dense water formed near the poles, the deep ocean would have held more carbon dioxide, which is produced by biological respiration of the organic carbon that constantly rains to the abyss in the form of dead organisms and organic debris that sink from the sunlit surface ocean.  To test this hypothesis, the degree of ocean stratification during the last ice age and the rate of deep-water replacement will be constrained by comparing the radiocarbon ages of organisms that grew in the surface ocean and at the sea floor within a critical region around Antarctica, where most of the replacement of deep waters occurs.  Completing this work will contribute toward improved models of future climate change.  Climate scientists rely on models to estimate the amount of fossil fuel carbon dioxide that will be absorbed by the ocean in the future.  Currently the ocean absorbs about 25% of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels.  Most of this carbon is absorbed in the Southern Ocean (the region around Antarctica).  How this will change in the future is poorly known.  Models have difficulty representing physical conditions in the Southern Ocean accurately, thereby adding substantial uncertainty to projections of future ocean uptake of carbon dioxide.  Results of the proposed study will provide a benchmark to test the ability of models to simulate ocean processes under climate conditions distinctly different from those that occur today, ultimately leading to improvement of the models and to more reliable projections of future absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean.  <br/><br/>The proposed work will add a research component to an existing scientific expedition to the Southern Ocean, in the region between the Ross Sea and New Zealand, that will collect sediment cores at three to five locations down the northern flank of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge at approximately 170°W.  The goal is to collect sediments at each location deposited since early in the peak of the last ice age.  This region is unusual in the Southern Ocean in that sediments deposited during the last ice age contain foraminifera, tiny organisms with calcium carbonate shells, in much greater abundance than in other regions of the Southern Ocean.  Foraminifera are widely used as an archive of several geochemical tracers of past ocean conditions.  In the proposed work the radiocarbon age of foraminifera that inhabited the surface ocean will be compared with the age of contemporary specimens that grew on the seabed.  The difference in age between surface and deep-swelling organisms will be used to discriminate between two proposed mechanisms of deep water renewal during the ice age:  formation in coastal polynyas around the edge of Antarctica, much as occurs today, versus formation by open-ocean convection in deep-water regions far from the continent.  If the latter mechanism prevails, then it is expected that surface and deep-dwelling foraminifera will exhibit similar radiocarbon ages.  In the case of dominance of deep-water formation in coastal polynyas, one expects to find very different radiocarbon ages in the two populations of foraminifera.  In the extreme case of greater ocean stratification during the last ice age, one even expects the surface dwellers to appear to be older than contemporary bottom dwellers because the targeted core sites lie directly under the region where the oldest deep waters return to the surface following their long circuitous transit through the deep ocean.  The primary objective of the proposed work is to reconstruct the water mass age structure of the Southern Ocean during the last ice age, which, in turn, is a primary factor that controls the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deep sea.  In addition, the presence of foraminifera in the cores to be recovered provides a valuable resource for many other paleoceanographic applications, such as: 1) the application of nitrogen isotopes to constrain the level of nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean and, thus, the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, 2) the application of neodymium isotopes to constrain the transport history of deep water masses, 3) the application of boron isotopes and boron/calcium ratios to constrain the pH and inorganic carbon system parameters of ice-age seawater, and 4) the exploitation of metal/calcium ratios in foraminifera to reconstruct the temperature (Mg/Ca) and nutrient content (Cd/Ca) of deep waters during the last ice age at a location near their source near Antarcitca."

These sites routinely gather data pertaining to end user activities to provide better services, and they collect server monitoring logs and performance counters to ensure uninterrupted service. Although fast, efficient, and cost-effective analyses of these large datasets can significantly improve users' quality of experience and enable novel applications, the wide area network (WAN) that connects the datacenters poses a considerable challenge: because WAN bandwidth is limited and expensive, and WAN latency is high and variable, both the performance and timeliness of analytics are affected by the WAN.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a new WAN-aware big data stack customized for flexible geo-distributed data analytics. The project will not impose any constraints on the set of queries that can be issued, and it will support a variety of performance objectives including obtaining timely responses, minimizing batch completion times, or using minimal bandwidth. To account for unpredictable and fine-timescale changes to WAN conditions and to enable coordination among the actions taken by different layers of the analytics stack, this project will enable holistic, cross-layer visibility and optimizations. It will incorporate awareness of the geo-distributed setting in the stack's upper layers (e.g., query optimization) and of application-level objectives in the lower layers (e.g., networking). This will result in a radical re-factoring of the API and interfaces between query optimization, query execution, resource negotiation, wide-area storage, and network routing/scheduling.<br/><br/>Software artifacts from this project will be incorporated into existing open source big data stacks, making the research outcomes broadly available for public reuse. The experimental harnesses will be made available to ensure repeatability and to foster follow up research. The research outcomes will guide industry evolution as the industry slowly shifts from single-datacenter to geo-distributed settings. The project has a substantial educational component involving the introduction of new courses on big data systems at both graduate and undergraduate levels that will involve hands-on exercises with state-of-the-art big data software, and it will reach out to high-school students, women, and underrepresented minorities through big data boot camps."

As a result, the Amazon and the Atlantic rainforests were much more extensive, occupying regions that are today covered by deserts and savannahs. When the climate became drier, those forests retracted and became fragmented. This change likely had dramatic effects on the animals and plants that live in tropical rainforests. This project asks how tropical forest organisms were affected by the climatic changes experienced over the past 250,000 years. The genomes of three species of lizards that occur in the Brazilian forests will be studied, and by comparing the DNA sequences of multiple individuals per species over their geographic range, the project will uncover the extent that their populations have expanded or declined in the past. This research shed light on how these organisms have responded to environmental change, in addition to the processes that led to their current distribution patterns. This project will provide training in molecular systematic methods and mentorship for undergraduate and Masters students at The City College of New York.  It also will foster new USA-Brazil scientific collaborations through joint field trips to northern Brazil.<br/><br/>This project seeks to test how populations of forest-associated lizards have been affected by a recently proposed dynamics of moisture transport in South America during the Quaternary. It will generate Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data of three arboreal lizard species that occur in both Amazon and the Atlantic rainforests (Anolis punctatus, A. ortonii and Polychrus marmoratus) using a restriction-site associated DNA sequencing protocol. Phylogenetic relationships will be inferred using coalescent-based methods. Analyses of genetic structure will be performed to infer the number of effective populations within the different species. Scenarios of population expansion, contraction, or persistence will be evaluated based on coalescent simulations and both likelihood-based methods and Approximate Bayesian Computation. Estimates of demographic parameters such as effective population sizes, divergence times between populations, and migration rates will be estimated using best-fit models. Together these data will provide new insights on the population structure for taxa in the Brazilian Atlantic and Amazonian rainforests, and how they have responded to recent climate perturbations."

This forms a series of faults and folds, known as a fold-thrust belt. The lowest fault (basal detachment), which allows everything above it to move, plays an important role in the evolution of the fold-thrust belt but is seldom found exposed at the surface. The Okcheon Belt in South Korea formed during a tectonic collision ~250 million years ago. It has a well-exposed basal detachment providing a rare opportunity to directly study it. Field data and rock samples will be gathered, in addition to field mapping, to look at the large scale and small scale deformation and flow of fluids occurring along the basal detachment. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Sanghoon Kwon at Yonsei University, a noted expert on the structural geology of the Permo-Triassic Collision. This collaboration will provide the first direct evidence of the processes occurring along basal detachments associated with the formation of mountain belts and will give further understanding of the processes by which mountains form. <br/><br/>A fold-thrust belt (FTB) is an important component of any orogenic belt. In existing models, the basal decollement plays a key role in the evolution of the FTB, but it is rarely exposed at the surface. The structurally lowest fault of the Okcheon Belt in South Korea is the well-exposed basal decollement of the collisional Permo-Triassic orogeny, which brought together the Gyeonggi and Yeongnam Massifs .This project will examine this decollement in collaboration with Dr. Sanghoon Kwon at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. To record observations and collect data, a series of structural transects will be studied both along and across the decollement zone. Hand samples will be taken along the transects to be used for microstructural analysis of deformation structures in the fault rocks (e.g. mylonites, cataclasites). To determine the role of fluids along the decollement samples of veins will be collected along the transects to conduct stable isotope and fluid inclusion analyses. In addition to these microscopic and chemical analyses, mesoscopic analysis of deformation structures will be conducted to determine the kinematics, mechanics, and role of fluids in a basal decollement deformation zone. This will lead to a more complete understanding of the effects of decollement rheology on the geometry and evolution of fold-thrust belts.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

These compounds not only give decomposing leaves their characteristic odor, they are also important to the chemistry of the atmosphere, and to underlying soils, where they can influence soil fertility and alter the types of organisms residing in soil. Hundreds of different VOCs can also be released by the microbes that consume vegetation on the forest floor, and microbial decay of leaves and branches from different plant species produces distinct VOCs during decomposition, contributing to the different smells of a pine versus an oak forest, for example. Scientists do not yet understand how the types and amounts of these substances vary as plant matter decomposes. Researchers also need to understand how the release of VOCs will be altered as forest composition shifts seasonally with changes in the environment. This research will not only address these knowledge gaps, it will also determine the importance of VOCs to underlying soils; how they may promote the storage of carbon in forest soils, and how they can influence soil fertility by altering nitrogen cycling and the types of microorganisms found in soils. This project will be conducted by a team of researchers both at the University of Colorado and at Virginia Tech where the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research. In addition, researchers at these universities will use the research results to introduce high school students to key concepts and tools in the study of soils and their roles in sustaining ecosystems.<br/><br/>All decomposing plant litter emits VOCs, and the total amount of carbon (C) released as VOCs can be surprisingly high, with some litters emitting VOCs at rates approaching that of C emissions as carbon dioxide. The proposed research will use a series of field and laboratory-based studies to determine 1) how the amounts and types of VOCs emitted vary as litter decomposition progresses, 2) the sensitivity of these emissions to changes in moisture and temperature regimes, 3) the degree to which the VOCs produced during litter decomposition represent a source of organic C to underlying soils, and 4) how these VOCs impact microbial communities and key nitrogen  cycling processes in soil. Together, the proposed work will improve model representations of VOC fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, an important objective given that some of these litter-derived VOCs can promote the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, this research will explore an understudied mechanism by which leaf litter can influence the biotic and abiotic characteristics of underlying soils. Ultimately this research could lead to the development of novel strategies to manage soil by identifying specific VOCs that could reduce soil pathogen loads or alter the rates of specific microbial processes that are critical to the maintenance of soil fertility."

The investigator will develop a new bedload flux module within an existing global-scale hydrological modeling framework.  The analyses will focus on the universal applicability of the physically based bedload module for large-scale simulations and on the spatial trends of the ratio between suspended and bedload fluxes along river systems as well as its relationship to river basin characteristics. To facilitate these analyses and to validate the model, a globally distributed observational database will be collected from existing U.S. Geological Survey databases, scholarly literature, online resources, and the investigator's collaborative network.  Outcomes from this research will provide one of the first spatially and temporally explicit first-order estimates of global bedload flux and a numerical framework for studying the parameters, drivers, and mechanisms of bedload flux in large global rivers.  The quantification of sediment transport in rivers will be catalytic for examining carbon and nutrient cycles, river, coastal and marine ecology, dam sustainability, and water and food security."

Our best `high-temperature (high-Tc)' superconductors still however require low temperatures to be functional. The search is therefore on to discover higher `high-Tc' superconductors. Two recent discoveries have created tremendous excitement in this field. The first is the discovery of enhanced superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) in monolayer films of FeSe grown. The Tc in these films is enhanced by a factor of approximately eight or ten compared to bulk crystals. The second exciting discovery is the observation of potential superconductivity in a new class of materials called iridates. The dramatically high Tcs observed in FeSe and potential superconductivity in the iridates have not only renewed our interest in the search for new and higher Tc materials but have also generated a series of new and as yet unanswered questions.

The project includes a special focus on the effects of surface doping on the properties of materials such as FeSe monolayers and multilayers electron-doped with potassium (K), and bulk and surface doped iridates. The PI's laboratory has the technology and expertise to probe the electron, phonon, and spin excitations of complex materials in real- and momentum-space using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), Fourier transform STS, and spin-polarized STS. In addition, a custom molecular beam epitaxy system in the PI's lab allows transport of thin film samples to the STM without exposing the films to air. These instruments are critical in the success of the projects. The goals of the project are multifold. The project investigates the mechanism by which superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced in ultrathin FeSe films and provides data to distinguish between the different mechanisms of Tc enhancement. For the Iridates, SI-STM data is used to differentiate Fermi arcs from Fermi pockets. If arcs are observed, studying the iridate system might shed light on the origin of such arcs in both iridates and cuprates. Understanding the mechanism of the surprisingly high superconducting transition temperatures in FeSe may point the way to realizing higher Tcs in other materials. If iridate d-wave superconductivity were confirmed, it would help elucidate many of the outstanding questions in cuprate superconductivity and provide a new playground to explore oxide superconductivity in general. The project has impact beyond progress in understanding superconductivity in these new materials.  Students working on these materials with SI-STS and MBE techniques are being trained on materials and instruments at the forefront of today's research. Many of PI's former advisees have been women. The success of the project enhances the research experience for women in physics. The PI's integrated outreach and education activities exposes talented high school students to cutting edge science."

Temperature depth-profiles are of particular current interest for estimating basal temperature and geothermal heat flux in Antarctica. Antarctic geothermal heat flux is presently poorly known except at recent drilling sites, and is the largest unknown in determining basal conditions. However, current logistical costs greatly limit drilling to acquire temperature profiles. Our long-term goal is the development, testing and commissioning of a new means of acquiring englacial temperature profiles at much lower costs than existing methods. To that end, we will undertake laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to develop to a new way to use ice melt probes, rather than traditional drilling, to deploy temperature measurement equipment to depths of a kilometer and greater. To use melt probes for this purpose, we must keep the melted ice above such probes from freezing completely, so that cable can be fed continually down to the probe as it descends. This development will also open the way toward recovering melt probes, so as to prevent environmental impacts and expense of equipment left in the field. Our initial experiments and modeling will test the validity of our approach and make it ready for further testing in the field.<br/><br/>Technical Description: We will undertake laboratory and modeling work (1) to reduce the technical risk in our approach to melt-probe deployment of Raman Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables; and (2) to begin development of a recoverable ice melt probe. Specifically, we will use numerical modeling of the Stefan problem with cylindrical symmetry to guide detailed designs for cable-heating and anti-freeze injection, and will test and revise candidate designs by means of laboratory testing. We will test the long-term stability of ethanol-filled melt holes, to gauge their suitability for recoverable melt probe systems for temperature measurement (where months-long thermal equilibration after installation will be required). We will gain experience with Raman DTS methods by employing DTS to measure critical temperature data in our laboratory experiments, both within the melt hole and in adjacent ice. To address recoverability, we will design and test a new melt head for the upper end of our ice melt probe, and demonstrate upward travel through a partially refrozen melt hole. Finally, we will publish both modeling and experimental results in peer-reviewed publications, and will present the project to a broad public audience in a special event at a Seattle museum of science and technology. The result of this work will be demonstrated technical readiness for testing in a subsequent project at larger ice-drilling test facilities at the earliest opportunity (prospectively, at the University of Wisconsin, following soon after completion of this project) and, following that, in the field."

Typically, the efficiency of energy-production and utilization systems is limited by heat loss; conversion of the wasted heat into usable energy may be accomplished using solid-state devices that convert heat to electricity, i.e. thermoelectrics.  Thermoelectric generators are used to power satellites, probes, and rovers, but their widespread terrestrial use would require increased device efficiencies.  This project explores a pathway towards high efficiency thermoelectrics using a naturally occurring phenomenon, spontaneous vertical phase separation, to achieve nanowire superlattices that extend over macroscopic lengths.  The ultimate goal is to understand heat propagation across the superlattices in order to optimize the performance of several advanced nanotechnologies. The project consists of a collaboration between the University of Michigan and Ben-Gurion University, integrating the expertise of the U.S. investigators (theory and thermoelectric characterization) with that of the Israeli investigators (nanowire fabrication and characterization). The new knowledge gained will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations, and curriculum development. Outreach activities emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/>Technical Description: Nanometer-scale heterostructured materials have been identified as promising candidates for high efficiency thermoelectric devices. In the framework of the phonon-glass-electron crystal concept, the thermoelectric efficiency can be enhanced by reducing dimensionality, through the formation of two-dimensional thin films or superlattices, one-dimensional nanowires, or zero-dimensional quantum dots.  Indeed, one-dimensional conductors, in which electrons are restricted to a narrow energy range, are predicted to enable conversion efficiencies approaching the Carnot limit. A primary goal of the project is to explore eutectic alloy catalyst-induced vertical phase separation during vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires.  In addition to developing predictive understanding of these mechanisms, nanowire superlattices extending over macroscopic length-scales will be fabricated, and spatially-resolved Seebeck measurements will be demonstrated using scanning thermoelectric microscopy. Finally, new understanding of the mechanisms for enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit in nanowires will be developed.  In particular, correlations between van Hove singularities in the density of states and enhancements of the Seebeck coefficient will be investigated using both doping and electrostatic gating to tune the Fermi level of the nanowires. The combined expertise of the team in nanowire growth, structural and thermoelectric characterization, and device simulation and fabrication will be used to develop a pathway to superlattice nanowires for thermoelectric generators."

For instance, one can contract the equator to transform the round sphere into an hourglass. While the neck of the hourglass does not look much like a round sphere anymore, the two bulbs are still pretty round. The celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem says that in some precise sense, no matter how the sphere is distorted, the average geometry of the result will still be round. Mathematicians view this result as an example where the topology of an object (i.e., the fact that it was produced by distorting a round sphere) constrains its geometry. The broad theme of this proposal is to develop similar results pertaining to higher dimensional abstract geometric objects. <br/><br/>Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Perelman in 2003, states that every closed three-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which admits one of eight types of homogenous metrics. Of these pieces, only the hyperbolic three-manifolds have not been classified.  The full statement of the Perelman's result includes topological conditions that characterize when a closed three-manifold M admits a hyperbolic metric. Mostow's Rigidity Theorem implies that a hyperbolic metric on such an M is unique, if it exists, so it is natural to try to extract concrete geometric information about the metric from the topology of M. Effective geometrization, studied by the PI and his collaborators, is a program to extract concrete geometric information about a hyperbolic metric on a three-dimensional manifold from its topology. A large part of this project involves finding a description of the geometry of M given only that the number of elements needed to generate the fundamental group of M is bounded, or that M has a topological decomposition with certain characteristics. The key technique is to understand a sequence of closed hyperbolic three-manifolds asymptotically by passing to geometric limits. This perspective will also be applied outside of hyperbolic geometry, in the study of the growth of Betti numbers in sequences of higher rank locally symmetric spaces, in a program inspired by an active field in graph theory."

Because invasion of pathogens into new host populations can have dramatic effects on hosts, including humans, ecologists have long studied the causes and consequences of pathogen invasion. Previous work has focused on situations in which pathogens invade host populations that are stable and already established. That work does not help us understand infectious disease in two other situations that are important: when a new host species is spreading across a landscape (where disease might help slow its spread) and when a rare host species is deliberately reintroduced as part of a conservation program (where disease is a threat to conservation goals). This project will be the first in-depth study of the second situation. It will explore how a rare host and common pathogen interact from the initial reintroduction of the host and invasion of the pathogen to their long-term persistence or die-out. The investigators will study an endangered Island Fox population, recently reintroduced to a California island. The foxes are now experiencing a major outbreak of a disease called leptospirosis, which causes major health problems for humans and wildlife around the world. This project will build understanding of how leptospirosis spreads in wildlife and eventually can infect humans and livestock. Island foxes are a rare success story in which Endangered Species Act protections have enabled the fox population to recover; this work will guide future management of Island Foxes.  More generally, this work will inform risk assessment and disease control in other reintroduction programs.  The project includes outreach efforts to inform the public, including southern California school-children, about conservation and disease issues.<br/><br/>The study system is the Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) on Santa Rosa Island, California. After a population crash in the late 1990s, all 14 remaining foxes on Santa Rosa were taken into captivity. A reintroduction program, beginning in 2004, reestablished foxes on the island, but an outbreak of Leptospira interrogans (the agent of leptospirosis) was discovered in 2010. Analysis of banked serum samples showed that the outbreak was already widespread on the island by 2009-10, and the pathogen likely invaded the fox population as it re-colonized the island after fox reintroduction. The island spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) was also found to be infected, and genetic analyses indicate a close link to a Leptospira strain circulating in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) that frequent the island. Extensive sample banks and population monitoring data provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the history of this pathogen invasion. This project will integrate field, laboratory, genomic and modeling approaches. Its goals are to determine the source of Leptospira in the Santa Rosa outbreak, characterize transmission dynamics in the island community throughout the establishment process, predict whether Leptospira will persist on the island, and assess the impact of Leptospira on fox health and conservation. The investigators will generalize the findings to extract lessons and tools to be applied to other disease systems."

Surfaces are fundamental objects in geometry, and the shape of surfaces in a space provides insight into the space.  The behavior of surfaces that are minimal or near-minimal is especially important.  For example, minimal surfaces, like soap films, are known to be smooth under many conditions, but surfaces that are only close to minimal can be rough. The PI intends to develop new tools to study minimal and close-to-minimal surfaces in a variety of spaces and use them to study geometric and analytical problems.  One proposed application of these tools is the study of the accuracy of the Goemans-Linial algorithm, an algorithm to approximate the best way of cutting an object into two roughly equal pieces.  This algorithm is a key ingredient in many ""divide-and-conquer"" algorithms, which solve complex problems by decomposing them into simpler ones.<br/><br/>The PI plans to develop new quantitative tools for studying the geometry of surfaces in groups and spaces and apply them to questions in geometric group theory, geometric measure theory, and theoretical computer science.  First, the project aims to prove a conjecture of Gromov and Thurston on the filling functions of lattices in symmetric spaces, providing new understanding of the large-scale geometry of these spaces.  Second, the project will explore decompositions of surfaces embedded in Euclidean space and try to use new tools from geometric measure theory to bound the geometry and topology of these surfaces.  Third, the project will analyze surfaces of finite perimeter in the Heisenberg group and other nilpotent groups.  If this last goal is successful, it would lead to sharp bounds on embeddings of the Heisenberg group into Banach spaces and sharp bounds on the accuracy of the best known approximate solution to the Sparsest Cut problem."

There are two reasons for proceeding in this way.  First, these rations are obvious candidates for co-integrating relationships, and second, the advantages of formally accounting for (near) unit roots are well understood.

These trends contrast those of the well-studied, western Antarctic Peninsula area, where sea ice has been disappearing. Unlike the latter, little is known about how expanding sea ice coverage might affect the regional Antarctic marine ecosystem. This project aims to better understand some of the potential effects of the changing ice conditions on the marine ecosystem using the widely-recognized indicator species - the Adélie Penguin.  A four-year effort will build on previous results spanning 19 seasons at Ross Island to explore how successes or failures in each part of the penguin's annual cycle are effected by ice conditions and how these carry over to the next annual recruitment cycle, especially with respect to the penguin's condition upon arrival in the spring.  Education and public outreach activities will continually be promoted through the PenguinCam and PenguinScience websites (sites with greater than 1 million hits a month) and ""NestCheck"" (a site that is logged-on by >300 classrooms annually that allows students to follow penguin families in their breeding efforts).  To encourage students in pursuing educational and career pathways in the Science Technology Engineering and Math fields, the project will also provide stories from the field in a Penguin Journal, develop classroom-ready activities aligned with New Generation Science Standards, increase the availability of instructional presentations as powerpoint files and short webisodes.  The project will provide additional outreach activities through local, state and national speaking engagements about penguins, Antarctic science and climate change. The annual outreach efforts are aimed at reaching over 15,000 students through the website, 300 teachers through presentations and workshops, and 500 persons in the general public. The project also will train four interns (undergraduate and graduate level), two post-doctoral researchers, and a science writer/photographer. <br/> <br/>The project will accomplish three major goals, all of which relate to how Adélie Penguins adapt to, or cope with environmental change. Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual?s lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability).  Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region."

It offers a general way to create macroscopically homogeneous combinations of highly dissimilar components, such as milk consisting of immiscible fat and water. Stabilizing the colloidal state in different systems is at the heart of many technological processes. This project is focused on a novel class of colloidal systems.  Preliminary studies show that a colloidal state can be realized for different nanoparticles in molten inorganic salt and, probably, in liquid metals. Liquid metals and molten salts are widely used in metallurgy and soldering, as heat transfer fluids in thermal solar technologies, and other important areas. Demonstrating stable colloidal systems in such media and understanding the factors that govern stability may open up opportunities to design new types of composites using a rich toolbox of techniques from colloidal chemistry. A comprehensive education and outreach program accompanies this research and focuses on education enrichment for the underrepresented African-American and Hispanic K-12 populations on Chicago's South Side. This project supports the continued development and distribution of nanoscience educational resources for the U. Chicago chemistry community as well as for K-12 students. This includes the development of a new graduate materials chemistry track at the University of Chicago and a continued successful effort to help undergraduates and high school students gain research experience. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project is directly relevant to the development of new colloidal systems. Nanoparticles of various transition metals, semiconductors, rare-earth, and magnetic materials form stable colloidal dispersions in various molten salts and liquid metals. The colloidal stability of nanoparticles in these media cannot be explained by traditional stabilization mechanisms. It appears that neither electrostatic nor steric repulsion can explain colloidal stability in a molten ionic salt. Given the very high charge density, electrostatic potential is screened on the sub-nm distance, making electrostatic repulsion short-ranged and inferior compared to van der Waals attraction. The absence of brush-like species at the particle surface in molten salt also rules out the possibility of classical steric stabilization. This project incorporates systematic experimental and theoretical investigations of this class of functional nanomaterials that are colloidally stabilized in molten inorganic salts and liquid metals.  Specific aims of this project include the study and development of an understanding of the colloidal stabilization mechanism in molten salts and liquid metals at elevated temperatures, as well as exploration of properties and potential applications for colloidal dispersions of nanomaterials in molten salts and liquid metals."

Many of those were designed to model different natural processes such as bacterial growth, crystal melting, very cold gases at atomic levels, etc. An accurate analysis at large times or scales is typically very difficult, and the project concentrates on models with additional algebraic structure that originate in seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. This structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal (i.e., present in a very wide range of systems). As a result, using sophisticated mathematical tools, the principal investigator seeks to find new universal laws that play the role of the famous and familiar bell curve law and that can often be observed through physical and numerical experiments.<br/><br/>The goal of the emerging field of integrable probability is to identify and analyze exactly solvable probabilistic models. The models and results are often easy to describe, yet difficult to find, and they carry essential information about broad universality classes of stochastic processes. The project aims at developing a bridge between deep algebraic and representation theoretic structures on one end, and probabilistic systems on the other end, that would allow to utilize the former in order to discover and study the latter. The framework of Macdonald processes introduced and developed in the last five years has been quite successful on this path, and it continues to grow. Known applications include interacting particle systems, random growing interfaces in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions, random matrices and log-gases, and directed polymers in random media. The framework is now poised to expand to include the theory of solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics, offering completely new perspective and new results in this well-established domain."

An attractive model system in which to address this question is the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system. GnRH neurons are master regulators of the reproductive system. They secrete GnRH peptides to initiate reproductive activity. Abnormal development of GnRH neurons can lead to reproductive disorders. Although significant advances have been made in understanding the central importance of GnRH neurons in reproduction, very little is known about where the GnRH progenitor (i.e., undifferentiated) cells are located in the developing nervous system and how they are instructed to become GnRH neurons. This project fills this gap in our knowledge. The anticipated results will provide new knowledge on how insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, a major embryonic growth-promoting pathway, regulates GnRH neuronal development.

In collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, the project also includes the development of a summer camp curriculum in neurobiology, entitled ""Shining Neurons in the Brain!"", for K-12 students. This and other outreach activities make this NSF-funded research accessible to the public. <br/><br/>An attractive model system in which to address the question of how newborn neurons are organized into the right locations with the right timing to form functional circuits is the GnRH neuronal system. GnRH neurons emerge from the nasal/olfactory placode in early embryos and undertake a long-distance migration from the olfactory region to the preoptic area and hypothalamus. The embryonic origin(s) of GnRH progenitor cells is still under debate. Little is known about how these progenitor cells are specified to give rise to GnRH neurons. Most vertebrate species have a second GnRH gene that is expressed in the midbrain. Much less is known about the GnRH2 neuron development and regulation. This project tests the hypothesis that the two types of GnRH neurons originate from the cranial neural crest- and/or optical placode-derived progenitor cells and that IGF signaling regulates the emergence of GnRH neurons at the right time and location by controlling the proliferation, migration, and/or survival of their progenitor cells. Perturbation of IGF signaling in a critical time window during early embryogenesis alters the temporal and spatial organization of the newborn GnRH neurons, which, in turn, affects reproductive function later in life. Aim 1 investigates the embryonic origins of GnRH neurons; Aim 2 determines whether IGF signaling regulates the emergence of the GnRH neurons by controlling  migration, proliferation, and/or survival of their progenitor cells, and Aim 3 determines the long-term reproductive consequences of this regulation."

They are responsible for many properties such as the thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of materials.  They even play a role in how materials will perform in new applications such as for quantum computing.  Understanding, and even harnessing, how these particles interact with each other is essential for designing and optimizing new materials. This project focuses on understanding how phonons interact in a few select physical processes. This research is accomplished by employing multidisciplinary experimental tools, ranging from materials design and synthesis of colloidal quantum structures to ultrafast optical spectroscopy, and it thus provides a fertile ground for students' training, K-12 outreach and curriculum development. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project supports an experimental activity with a goal to understand phononic interactions at the nanoscale and to address a few phonon-mediated fundamental processes by adopting a multi-pronged experimental approach. It particularly combines ultrafast optical spectroscopy with pre-designed colloidal hybrid nanostructures that can possess well-defined nanoscale interface topology for phonon engineering. This research directly involves graduate students training in tools and techniques needed to address a few fundamental issues: effect of interfacial symmetry (centrosymmetric vs. non-centrosymmetric interfaces) on nanoscale phonon characteristics; all optical control of interfacially coupled phonons and their interplay in time domain; understanding interactions between optically excited phonons and other quantum dynamics. Accomplishment of this project should advance our nanoscale materials engineering capability and new design guidelines for desirable phonon properties, as well as our understanding of phonon-dependent physical processes. This work is additionally important because hybrid nanostructures with well-defined interface topology for phonon engineering can be utilized as building blocks for functional phononic devices. In addition to graduate and undergraduate students' laboratory training, this project also allows for integrated education platform with cutting-edge research activities in classroom and various outreach activities with particular focus on underrepresented minority students' education."

An increasingly important requirement is to maintain high availability of these systems even in the face of changing requirements, faults, and resources. To address that concern, system developers today incorporate hand-written run-time adaptation strategies to automatically keep a system functioning effectively. However, as software systems grow in both complexity and ubiquity, and as the rate of technological change continues to increase, manual approaches cannot keep up. We must instead treat the evolution of adaptation strategies as a first-order concern.  This research develops new mechanisms to automatically adapt and evolve the adaptation strategies themselves.  Our high-level approach is to reuse previous domain or expert knowledge to inform the construction of flexible strategies, able to adapt to unanticipated changes and to various potential dimensions of system or environmental change.<br/><br/>Future-generation software systems will need to automatically optimize for multiple interacting, difficult-to-measure, and evolving qualities, properties, and priorities.  Existing work provides methods for constructing complex software systems that can adapt to the changing of certain circumstances such as changing environmental conditions, infrastructure availability, or user demands,<br/>while continuing to provide service at required quality levels.  Our motivating insight is that stochastic search methods are especially promising for<br/>self-adaptive software systems, and in particular for tackling the evolution of self-adaptation strategies, as evidenced in part by recent work that scales such techniques to complex source-level software problems. This research develops a principled foundation for the evolution of adaptation strategies in the self-adaptive domain, using stochastic search.  The resulting family of techniques reuses, recombines, and otherwise builds upon previous knowledge about a given system to adapt to four major potential change dimensions: (1) the system's architecture and deployment; (2) the tactics that can be deployed in an adaptation scenario, including mechanisms to choose between them and information regarding their applicability, costs, effects, success likelihood, etc.; (3) the system's quality goals, and their relative priorities; and (4) the environmental assumptions that control the context in which the system is deployed. The unifying factor in each of these strategies is the existence of previous domain or expert knowledge that can be leveraged for evolving adaptive strategies moving forward."

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience, and has emerged to address the need of the brain-mapping scientific community for a forum to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging-based methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-one highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2016 Annual Meeting to be held in Geneva, Switzerland. Travel awards will be given to the 25 students with the highest-ranked abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled). <br/><br/>The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low.  In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively very high.  Hence, the ability to work in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience. As neuroimaging is used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines, we would expect benefits for society in areas ranging from economic and social policies to medical, educational and psychological interventions."

With an increasing number of aging structures in the United States, there is a growing need for workforce development to address the potential for historic preservation in coming years.  The goal of this project is to develop a cadre of experts with specialized training and global awareness in the engineering aspects of historical preservation projects.  To address this need, Dr. Erdogmus from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will collaborate with the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) of Turkey.  This 3-year program will bring a group of nine US students to Turkey for a seven-week summer research in historic preservation engineering.  It is the intention of the PI to recruit at least 50% of the cohort each year from underrepresented groups.  The Turkish mentors from IZTECH are Dr. Mine Turan and Dr. Engin Aktas, representing the Architectural Restoration and Civil Engineering Departments, respectively.  Under the experienced leadership of the hosts and the PI, the US students participating in the program will be provided with meaningful and comprehensive research experiences comprised of lab-work at IZTECH campus and a variety of field-applications that involve historical sites. <br/><br/>This three year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will involve American graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the interface of structural engineering and conservation with three focus themes: 1) Engineering- conservation coordination for assessment of historical structures and materials prior to an intervention, 2) Engineering- conservation coordination for the development of compatible materials for historical retrofits, and 3) Post-Intervention assessment and risk analysis for the collapse-safety of structures. Under each of these focus themes, the IRES students will conduct specific projects and tasks; namely, the students will: a) Develop a novel method to provide a closed feedback loop on complex sites, which involves a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) based rating system for each element correlating the visual assessments to its interior damage levels.  This will then inform variant constitutive models and aid in the design for the conservation intervention. b) Investigate chemical and mechanical properties of modern cements from different locations in order to evaluate their behavior under extreme heat, salt water, and freeze-thaw cycles when paired with different historical stones. c) Develop a decision making algorithm for historical structures using probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses to identify safety concerns and to predict design event recurrence intervals for which a given structure remains safe. This algorithm will then support decisions for or against intervention, ensuring only a minimum level of invasive intervention applied to the historic site.

Some landscapes are so highly degraded that active restoration, such as direct tree planting, is necessary to facilitate forest recovery. In tropical forests requiring active management interventions, a wide range of restoration techniques have been employed to assist forest recovery at various stages of re-growth, although it is not clear how to best select tree species for restoration projects, especially given ongoing changes to the environment. This graduate student project seeks to determine how above- and below-ground plant traits influence the survival and growth of planted trees, to determine if plant traits can be used to efficiently and inexpensively select the best tree species for restoration of Costa Rican tropical dry forests (TDF). These forests are highly endangered, cover an estimated 42% of tropical land area, and are understudied compared to their wetter counterparts. Results from this research have the potential to greatly advance ecological restoration theory, and to aid in the restoration of tropical dry forests, especially those facing significant drought stress due to ongoing environmental change.<br/><br/>This project takes a functional trait-based approach to experimentally test the efficiency of using plant traits to select tree species for a large-scale TDF restoration project. Field based quantification of above- and belowground plant traits, as well as genetic analyses of fungal communities associating with plant roots, will be combined with tree seedling growth data to determine the extent to which above- and belowground traits can be used to predict plant performance in a restoration setting. A 6-hectare restoration experiment will be used to determine if species' trait syndromes, grouped by resource acquisition strategies, predict the performance of tree species along successional trajectories. In addition to conducting these projects, the researchers will engage the local conservation, forestry, and farming community in a workshop on TDF adaptive management strategies. These projects will also give undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct independent research projects in collaboration with the researchers. All of this research will be conducted in direct collaboration with TDF restoration practitioners at Horizontes Experimental Forest Station, part of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in Northwestern Costa Rica."

DMSP can be converted to the compound dimethylsulfide (DMS) which is a molecule that can escape into the atmosphere where it is known to have strong condensation properties that are involved in regional cloud formation.  Production of DMSP can influence the diversity and composition of microbial assemblages in seawater and the types and activities of microbes in the seawater will likely affect the magnitude of DMSP\DMS production. The proposal aims to examine the role of DMSP in structuring the microbial communities in Antarctic waters and how this structuring may influence DMSP cycling. The project will leverage the Antarctic research to introduce concepts and data linking microbial diversity and biogeochemistry to a range of audiences (including high school and undergraduate students in Maine).  The project will also engage teacher and students in rural K-8 schools and will allow a collaboration with a science writer and illustrator who will join the team in the field. The writer will use the southern ocean experience as the setting for a poster and a book about the proposed research and the scientists studying extreme environments.  <br/><br/>The project will examine (1) the extent to which the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters influences the composition and diversity of bacterial and protistan assemblages; (2) conversely, whether the composition and diversity of southern ocean protistan and bacterial assemblages influence the magnitude and rates of DMSP cycling; (3) the expression of DMSP degradation genes by marine bacteria seasonally and in response to additions of DMSP; and, to synthesize these results by quantifying (4) the microbial networks resulting from the presence of DMSP-producers and DMSP-consumers along with their predators, all involved in the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters. The work will be accomplished by conducting continuous growth experiments with DMSP-amended natural samples during field sampling of different microbial communities present in summer and fall. Data from the molecular (such as 16S/ 18S tag sequences, DMSP-cycle gene transcripts) and biogeochemical (such as biogenic sulfur cycling, bacterial production, microbial biomass) investigations will be integrated via network analysis."

The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres, which are used to study the connections between these basic components, are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. Many problems in other fields, especially differential topology, have been reduced to the study of these groups, which is notoriously difficult. However, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory. This project studies two of the most important structural conjectures in this field, the telescope and chromatic splitting conjectures. It has a strong computational component that will provide data to help study these two fundamental problems.<br/><br/>Chromatic homotopy theory uses higher analogues of K-theory which give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The chromatic splitting conjecture is an attempt at explaining the relationship between different periodicities. Recently, the PI has disproved a special case of this conjecture. In a project with Goerss and Henn, the PI aims to explain this failure and reformulate the conjecture. In a related project with Xu, the PI plans to compute the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere at the prime two. These computations use self-dual resolutions which appear to be related to Brown-Commenetz duality and the structure of the K(2)-local Picard group. The PI plans to study this connection with Bobkova, Goerss and Henn. A parallel part of the project is to study periodicity in relation to the telescope conjecture. In work with Behrens, Bhattacharya, Culver and Xu, the PI plans to detect periodic elements using a resolution of the sphere by topological modular forms. The telescope conjecture gives a connection between periodic elements detected by such methods and those detected by the K(2)-local sphere. Comparing the two computations may shed light on this conjecture."

The southern U.S. near the Gulf Coast and the eastern U.S. bordering the Atlantic experienced two cycles of super-continent formation and break-up.  These episodes of collision and rifting altered the crust and mantle lithosphere of the North American plate, thickening these layers in some regions, thinning them in others, and producing distinctive structures by aligning mineral grains and melting small amounts of rock.  In this project we will use earthquake waves to construct three-dimensional models of the crust and mantle lithosphere, and we will interpret these models to better understand how continental collision and rifting affect continental lithosphere.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to improve resolution of crust and mantle structure in the southern and eastern U.S. in order to better understand lithospheric evolution and modification through the last Wilson cycle. The southern and eastern margins of the North America continent experienced two complete Wilson cycles of orogeny and rifting, leaving varied signatures of deformation and magmatism in the crust and mantle lithosphere of these regions.  However, many aspects of crust and mantle structure remain poorly known at the scales relevant to distinguishing the effects of orogeny, rifting, and other processes such as hotspot interaction.  Using data from the NSF EarthScope USArray/Transportable Array (TA), now completed in the contiguous U.S., we propose to image crust and mantle seismic structure in new detail.  We will focus on two regions: one spanning the southern craton edge, the entire Ouachita orogeny and the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, and the other containing the eastern craton edge, the central and northern Appalachians, and the Atlantic coast.  We will use seismic data from TA stations, supplemented by other temporary and permanent broadband stations, to image crustal and mantle discontinuities using Sp and Ps receiver functions, construct 3-D anisotropic models based on Rayleigh wave, Love wave and shear-wave-splitting analyses, and we will integrate these data and methods through joint analyses and inversions.  The seismic models will be used constrain the style and geometry of deformation in the crust and mantle lithosphere due to the last episodes of orogeny and rifting.  This interpretation will be guided by geological and active source indicators of deformation in the shallow crust and by the type and age of magmatism across the region, bearing in mind that some facets of crust and mantle structure may reflect events that predated or followed the last cycle of orogeny and continental rifting.  Variations in the impact of orogeny and rifting on the lithosphere will be compared between and within the study regions. The proposed project will support the education and career development of graduate students at the University of Houston and at Brown. It will also contribute to undergraduate senior theses, lab exercises and group research projects in undergraduate and graduate courses, and to science outreach activities with local public schools.  Students from diverse backgrounds will be recruited to participate in this research."

This newly developed concept is called thermal consolidation. The researcher will work under the supervision of Dr. Chang-Young Yune at the Gangneung-Wonju National University in South Korea and Dr. Guney Olgun from Virginia Tech in the USA. Dr. Yune is a world-renown expert in soft clay engineering and has developed a consolidation chamber to study the compression of soft clays. This is a one-of-a-kind experimental setup that will allow the researcher to inject a range of high temperatures into a variety of clayey soils to assess how this increase in temperature affects the strength of the soil. The improvement of soft soils is of paramount importance because it will enable the construction of heavy structures on soft soils.<br/><br/>The thermal consolidation will be conducted by circulating hot fluid in a piping system that goes down and up through a borehole contained in a consolidation chamber. Clay particles increase in volume due to thermo-elastic expansion, which causes a reduction in pore volume between the clay particles, and a subsequent increase in strength. This experimental study will allow the researcher to understand the behavioral mechanisms of pore pressure development, drainage, and strength gain during the thermal improvement. The thermal improvement of soft clays represents a major scientific and engineering breakthrough to improve in-situ conditions of soft clay deposits for the construction of buildings with heavy structural loads. The expected findings will also positively impact the engineering practice by reducing the costs associated with in-situ ground improvement of soft clay deposits. The summer research will lay the foundations for more detailed experimental and analytical studies to further investigate the thermo-mechanical phenomenon related to thermal improvement of soft clays. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

However, a significant limitation is its tendency to creep over long durations. This is especially problematic in high-rise building, as undesirable creep deformations can involve expensive repairs, strengthening, or replacement, or can ultimately result in fracture and failure. The large time scales over which such deformations occur (years) make it challenging, if not impossible, to directly assess the creep propensity of concrete. To this end, numerous predictive models of creep have been suggested. However, most of them lack a sound physical basis and are heavily parameterized, which renders their predictions questionable at best, especially for new emerging binders in which ordinary portland cement is partially or fully replaced by more environment-friendly materials like fly ash, slag or limestone. This project aims to identify the physical origin of the creep in concrete to enable reliable long-term predictions of creep deformations. Based on this knowledge, new testing protocols will be studied, and creep-resistant cementitious binders will be identified. This research integrates multiple disciplines, including physics, material science, and civil engineering and will train a diverse group of students to multi-dimensional engineering.<br/><br/>To elucidate the physical origin of creep in concrete, and to discriminate, e.g., between the sliding or dissolution-precipitation mechanisms, this research relies on a combination of simulations. All simulations mutually feed into each others and capture the contribution of each of the relevant scales of cementitious binders. This bottom-up strategy starts from atomistic molecular dynamics coupled with topological constraint theory, culminates in continuum finite element simulations, and benefits from mesoscale modeling to ensure the hand-shake of all the considered spatial scales. Each simulation will be systematically informed, complemented, and validated by experiments, which comprise indentation, vertical scanning interferometry, and uniaxial creep tests. This interdisciplinary effort will identify the decisive variables (e.g., composition, nanostructure, and chemical instability) that render a material sensitive, or not, to long-term aging phenomena such as creep. Pioneering accelerated perturbation-based simulation methods will be evaluated, which will permit the study of long-term aging and degradation phenomena in amorphous materials rapidly. Finally, the project will contribute to reveal the link between bulk properties (chemical composition, structure) and surface properties (e.g., dissolution rates)."

Research has yet to explore whether a heightened emphasis on social control in these environments provides a climate antithetical to the cultivation of adolescents' innovative thinking and creativity, attributes that are considered essential to their success in the engineering sciences. Research of this kind will be useful in identifying: 1) the school and neighborhood dimensions most strongly related to the dispositions and trajectories of underrepresented populations at key junctures of engineering pathways, and 2) the kind of educational reforms and neighborhood programs that will aid students' secondary school preparation, post-secondary persistence in the fields, and eventual entry into the engineering professions. In support of these important aims, this research applies advanced statistical methods to the ELS dataset to answer the following questions:   <br/><br/>1. What contextual structures, processes and effects in existing research are most related to race-gender groups' occupational attainment in engineering?<br/><br/>2. Are school and neighborhood social control strategies related to race-gender trajectories in secondary school preparation, post-secondary persistence, and entry into the engineering workforce? <br/><br/>3. Is more variation in race-gender groups' engineering career trajectories accounted for by their neighborhood or school context? <br/><br/>4. What causal inferences can be made about the engineering career trajectories of nearly identical race-gender groups that differ in their exposure to more or less restrictive methods of social control within neighborhoods and schools?<br/><br/>The transformative potential of this study extends from its capacity to fill multiple voids in our engineering workforce development and broadening participation knowledge base. Identifying neighborhood and school qualities associated with race-gender groups' likelihood of entering engineering science professions contributes specific knowledge about school and non-school contexts as sites of engineering career development. This project considers whether society's pursuit of social control and order establishes a climate within both contexts that is antithetical to the cultivation of adolescents' interest in engineering. Youth of color, African American and Latino males in particular, are most likely to be exposed to punitive social control strategies, and may become less likely to enter the engineering field as a consequence. To explore these possibilities, this project uses systematic literature review procedures and innovative quantitative methods to investigate the longitudinal career trajectories of participants in the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) of 2002. The research uses social control, intersectionality, and status attainment theories to frame the estimation of race-gender trajectories at critical stages of career development. This study aligns with NSF priorities and national calls to broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups at all stages of their career development. Study results about the engineering experiences of race-gender groups within neighborhood and school contexts will reveal areas where investment and reforms can expand access and interest in engineering careers. The policy relevance of this research is significant and will inform decision-makers and practitioners about the human capital cost to engineering fields previously hidden in the uninvestigated effects of social control strategies. This study will offer potentially transformative recommendations for schools that, if adopted, would enable the replication of inclusive learning environments that align with expansive engineering opportunities."

The overarching goal of this research project is to develop novel species measurement technique to characterize fundamental physical and chemical processes in harsh environments such as those present in modern gas turbine combustor and IC engines.  The new techniques developed here have the potential to uncover quantitative, spatially and temporally resolved key intermediate species measurements in reacting flow systems by using the latest developments in the ultrashort pulse laser technology.  In addition to primary research outcomes, graduate and undergraduate students including minorities and underrepresented groups are trained in unique, next-generation laser fundamentals and applications.  Students work in multidisciplinary research environments and often interact with outside research teams, preparing them for successful future careers in optics and energy related technologies.  Research findings will be incorporated into ongoing curriculum and course development work as well as our outreach activities for K-12 STEM groups, further enhancing the broader impacts of this effort.  <br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to develop an ultrafast-laser-based optical diagnostic technique capable of measuring chemical species-with initial focus on highly reactive atomic species-in harsh environments without taking in to account complex quenching processes that limit the precision and accuracy of such measurements.  Space and time varying concentrations of quenching partners are virtually impossible to quantify in such turbulent flow fields.  Furthermore, temperature- and pressure-dependent species-specific quenching cross section data needed for corrections are rather limited and virtually impossible to obtain in many practical situations.  In recent years, significant advances have been made in femtosecond-laser-based diagnostic tools for high-repetition-rate imaging of atomic and molecular species in flames and plasmas.  However, molecular quenching effects have still prevailed in these diagnostics.  In the present work, innovative new nonlinear optical techniques are investigated to elevate such diagnostics to the next level by measuring important atomic and molecular species without the need of quenching corrections.  The new diagnostics will be evaluated in high-pressure conditions as well and complex reacting turbulent flow conditions.  Subsequently, they will be used to generate critical data sets for chemical kinetics model validation in a selected set of turbulent flames and to characterize a new type of 'wall-less' reactor designed for chemical kinetics studies."

In the chemical looping oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) process, the oxygen necessary for the combustion process is released from a metal oxide, called the oxygen carrier, eliminating the direct contact between air and fuel, causing carbon dioxide to be easily separated. The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the interaction of nitrogen and sulfur species with the oxygen carrier material employing various experimental techniques as well as molecular modeling. This research will create an impact on the chemical looping plants that will be built in the future, in the sense that it will provide a fundamental understanding of the pollutant formation during the CLOU process. This understanding would aid in the design of emission control technologies, if a treatment of the carbon dioxide stream is required prior to sequestration depending on the emission levels and regulations. Experimental data that will be produced from this project will provide insight into the effect of such pollutants on the activity of the oxygen carrier, which would help the design of future oxygen carrier materials that would last for many oxidation reduction cycles, thus reducing the cost of the materials.<br/><br/>There has been a great effort in the discovery of oxygen carrier materials that are suitable for chemical looping applications; however, there is a lack of a fundamental understanding of the heterogeneous chemistry occurring on the oxygen carrier surface, especially for the interactions with impurities. In the proposed work, various combinations of copper and manganese-based oxygen carrier and support materials will be tested under CLOU conditions while being exposed to nitrogen and sulfur species to shed light into the heterogeneous reactions taking place on the oxygen carrier surface. The oxygen carrier surfaces will also be simulated using density functional theory and the reaction pathways will be determined. By employing bench-scale experiments and theoretical simulations, this project will provide a fundamental understanding of NOx (nitrogen oxides) and SOx (sulfur oxides) formation mechanisms specific to the CLOU process."

These organisms use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous dissolved in liquid medium to make lipids which can be processed into liquid transportation fuel.   The growth of algae in outdoor open ponds, and the accumulation of lipids by the algae, can vary considerably during the day or week.  This requires frequent monitoring of algal productivity for production planning.  However, measurement of algal productivity is presently time consuming and costly, requiring manual sampling and sophisticated analytical instruments. The goal of this project is to develop a simple, real-time sensor for monitoring algal lipids in a cultivation environment that is constantly changing.  The proposed work will develop a sensor platform that measures the electrical properties of single algal cells as they flow through a microscope capillary tube.  The change in electrical properties is correlated to the amounts and types of lipid stored within the algal cell.  The educational activities associated with the project feature a student-run technical conference designed to diversify and provide mentorship for students in the Mechanical Engineering graduate program at Cornell University.  <br/><br/>In outdoor pond cultivation systems used for algal biofuel production, the growth and lipid accumulation in algal cells are sensitive to constantly changing liquid nutrient medium composition, temperature, and sunlight intensity.  Co-cultures containing two or more species of algae that have disparate metabolisms and chromophores may add stability to the overall cultivation platform under these changing conditions.  However, lipid production in algal cells is often triggered by nutrient starvation, which adds to the temporal complexity of the system.  There is a need to monitor and summarize all of this biological complexity with simple measurements that describe the overall lipid productivity of the co-culture as well as lipid productivity of individual sub populations.  The proposed research will develop a microfluidic dielectric impedance monitor for rapid lipid detection in single algal cells and characterize lipid storage in algal co-cultures to elucidate mixed-strain culture effects.  The project has three objectives.  The first objective is to characterize starvation-induced, dielectric-property shifts in Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Neochloris oleoabundans and relate these shifts to biomass density and sequestration of lipids and starches. The second objective is to validate the flow-impedance cytometry measurements of lipid and starch accumulation by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-performance liquid chromatography.  The third objective is to characterize the role of algal diversity with single-cell and bulk characterization of lipids in mixed-species culture."

Chorus waves are radio waves in the acoustic frequency range.  If converted to acoustic waves they sound like whistling or chirping, hence the name.  Fine structures in the waveform called rising and falling tones are the source of these chirping sounds.  The rising tones have received a lot of attention, with several mechanisms suggested for their formation.  Not so for the falling tones. This project will investigate further a new mechanism for the generation of falling tones and examine the interaction of radiation belts electron with chorus - both rising and falling tones.  Research into these waves benefits not only the field of space physics but also plasma physics and fusion.  In addition the project will provide training for a postdoctoral student and research support for an early-career scientist (the proposer) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>There are significant differences in the mechanisms that have been proposed to generate chorus (focusing mostly on rising tones) compared to the new mechanism suggested for falling tones.  Most current theories conclude that plasma density variations and/or inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are necessary to generate chorus.  In fact, for rising tone chorus, simulations show that spectral characteristics of the chorus are directly related to the geomagnetic field inhomogeneity.  However, the falling tone waves have much more oblique wave normal angles and, as a result, more resonances with plasma electrons are possible.  Competition between resonances that cause growth and damping of the waves can make them marginally stable, resulting in nonlinear effects that produce chirping.  This new picture of falling tone chorus generation along with scattering of electrons by chorus will be investigated through the combined use of analytic model developments and computational particle in cell (PIC) and Tristan-mp code runs. The roles of various plasma parameters will be determined from runs of a 1D Vlasov code, which solves for the time evolution of the electron distribution."

Tropical societies and ecosystems rely heavily on monsoon rainfall, and thus understanding the origin and nature of decadal-scale hydroclimate variability is critical to understanding the dynamics at play in such systems.<br/><br/>Recent field studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggests that over the last millennium, the TRB may have contracted during the Little Ice Age (LIA)  thereby producing reduced monsoon rainfall along both the northern and southern margins of the TRB.  In contrast, paleohydrologic and modeling studies show that the global TRB shifted southward meridionally at this time, creating anti-phasing (dry/wet) of rainfall between the TRB northern and southern margins. <br/><br/>The researchers have developed a sub-decadal resolved (~4 year) late Holocene (the last 3,000 years) IASM reconstruction from cave KNI-51 that, when integrated with paleomonsoon records from Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent, reveal not only TRB contraction during the LIA, but expansion and contraction at multi-decadal to centennial time scales over the entirety of the late Holocene. <br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are to extend the KNI-51 stalagmite record through the middle and early Holocene (9,000-3,000 years ago) to examine the nature of TRB dynamics during conditions distinct from those of the late Holocene, including elevated contrasts between summer insolation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, lower eustatic sea level (and increased exposure of Indo-Pacific continental shelf), intervals of reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime. <br/><br/>To better understand atmospheric circulation associated with TRB dynamics, these proxy data will be integrated with climate dynamical analyses of the 6,000 year time slice simulations conducted within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5/Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) framework and with the newly available Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) simulations conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>The project involves the potential for a unique view of TRB variability over the last 9,000 years and provides an important test of the skill of CMIP5-class models to accurately reproduce associated Indo-Pacific atmospheric dynamics.  As the TRB is closely tied to tropical methane production, this research will help refine estimates of regional tropical methane fluxes during the Holocene. The research will be conducted with extensive involvement of undergraduate students thereby providing experience in advanced paleoclimate research and data analysis techniques."

These compounds not only give decomposing leaves their characteristic odor, they are also important to the chemistry of the atmosphere, and to underlying soils, where they can influence soil fertility and alter the types of organisms residing in soil. Hundreds of different VOCs can also be released by the microbes that consume vegetation on the forest floor, and microbial decay of leaves and branches from different plant species produces distinct VOCs during decomposition, contributing to the different smells of a pine versus an oak forest, for example. Scientists do not yet understand how the types and amounts of these substances vary as plant matter decomposes. Researchers also need to understand how the release of VOCs will be altered as forest composition shifts seasonally with changes in the environment. This research will not only address these knowledge gaps, it will also determine the importance of VOCs to underlying soils; how they may promote the storage of carbon in forest soils, and how they can influence soil fertility by altering nitrogen cycling and the types of microorganisms found in soils. This project will be conducted by a team of researchers both at the University of Colorado and at Virginia Tech where the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research. In addition, researchers at these universities will use the research results to introduce high school students to key concepts and tools in the study of soils and their roles in sustaining ecosystems.<br/><br/>All decomposing plant litter emits VOCs, and the total amount of carbon (C) released as VOCs can be surprisingly high, with some litters emitting VOCs at rates approaching that of C emissions as carbon dioxide. The proposed research will use a series of field and laboratory-based studies to determine 1) how the amounts and types of VOCs emitted vary as litter decomposition progresses, 2) the sensitivity of these emissions to changes in moisture and temperature regimes, 3) the degree to which the VOCs produced during litter decomposition represent a source of organic C to underlying soils, and 4) how these VOCs impact microbial communities and key nitrogen  cycling processes in soil. Together, the proposed work will improve model representations of VOC fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems, an important objective given that some of these litter-derived VOCs can promote the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, this research will explore an understudied mechanism by which leaf litter can influence the biotic and abiotic characteristics of underlying soils. Ultimately this research could lead to the development of novel strategies to manage soil by identifying specific VOCs that could reduce soil pathogen loads or alter the rates of specific microbial processes that are critical to the maintenance of soil fertility."

Despite its abstract nature, algebraic topology has proven to be useful in a variety of applications, including theoretical physics, where the subject arises naturally in attempts to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, and data science, where the subject has had considerable impact in the analysis of large data sets. A fifty-year-old question in the field known as the Kervaire invariant problem was solved in 2009; the answer to the question at the heart of the problem was the opposite of what most experts had expected, and surprising new techniques, potentially useful in other areas, were required in the proof.  The research project aims to amplify this discovery and adapt it to further applications.<br/><br/>The principal investigator plans to follow up on this advance in two ways. First, a book in progress is designed to make the solution methods accessible to graduate students and other interested non-experts in the field, amplifying the mathematical infrastructure in equivariant homotopy theory and category theory for the Kervaire invariant problem with illustrative examples and explanations. Second, the tools developed to solve the Kervaire invariant problem are being adapted to further applications. In particular, there is a counterpart to the problem for each prime number. The recent solution of the original, geometrically motivated, problem was for the prime 2. The algebraic analog for primes 5 and larger had been solved in the late 1970s. The algebraic problem remains open for the prime 3, and the principal investigator has a plan for solving it. In addition, the surprising nature of the solution to the 2-primary problem raises more questions than it answers, implying in particular that certain predicted patterns in the homotopy groups of spheres cannot occur. The question of what might replace them is wide open."

Professor Shigeru Amemiya of the University of Pittsburgh is developing new experimental strategies to measure the high electrochemical reactivity of clean graphitic surfaces of traditional carbon materials and emerging carbon nanomaterials. A simple approach is developed to maintain clean graphitic surfaces in the research laboratory as well as in industrial settings where the mass production of carbon electrodes is important. Clean graphitic surfaces may improve the performance of the low-cost carbon electrodes that are widely used for fuel cells, batteries, solar cells, and supercapacitors. In addition, undergraduate students, female students, and students from underrepresented groups are recruited and trained through various nanoelectrochemical research activities. Other activities include industrial collaborations, and the implementation of nanoelectrochemistry experiments for the undergraduate laboratory.<br/><br/>This project is focused on the electrochemical study of clean graphitic surfaces for a greater fundamental understanding and better future applications of carbon electrochemistry. New technologies developed in the Amemiya laboratory are combined to enable the first reactivity measurement of unambiguously clean graphitic surfaces. Specifically, the clean graphitic surface is protected from airborne hydrophobic contaminants by condensing a nanometer-thick adlayer of water on the surfaces in humidified air.  The surface is maintained in electrolyte solutions containing extremely low concentrations of organic impurities. The ultrafast electron-transfer kinetics of water-protected clean graphitic surfaces are then measured quantitatively and reliably by employing nanogap voltammetry and scanning electrochemical microscopy."

The American Southwest (here defined as Arizona, southern Utah, and southern Nevada) appears to be mostly inactive tectonically. However, there is evidence that large earthquakes have occurred here in recent geologic times. We explore the possibility that the amount of crustal deformation in this area (and thus can generate (large) earthquakes) varies with time and is modulated by large earthquakes in southern California and Gulf of California. We have seen evidence for this by using GPS observations of the deformation pattern before and after the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (M7.2). We will combine ongoing GPS measurements with different modeling tools to characterize and model the source of the time-variable and long-term deformation, which we aim to separate. The time-variable deformation can be understood as visco-elastic deformation in the lithosphere following large (far-field) earthquakes. The long-term deformation can likely be modeled by considering the proper ratio of the far-field stresses imposed by Pacific plate motion and stresses due to lateral variation in crustal thickness and density in our study area. <br/><br/>This is a follow-on proposal that extends our current EarthScope project on the Colorado Plateau area. Over the last five years, the long-term kinematics as measured by GPS are obscured by postseismic deformation from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, which occurred 3 months before we installed a new 34-station continuous network.  As a result, important questions on the role of Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) variations in driving deformation, the reasons for the dearth of active faults and seismicity in southern Arizona, and the reach of plate motion stresses remain unanswered.  In order to address these questions, and simultaneously further our understanding of the postseismic process, we propose a three-tiered approach: 1) extend existing GPS time-series to improve characterization of transient deformation, 2) use those data to explore the crustal and mantle viscosities required to match the GPS time-series data, and 3) create physical models of the long-term expected deformation, that includes the latest GPE estimates, to explain the residual motions after correction for postseismic effects. We will also leverage GPS data from other NSF funded projects, as well as seismic data products obtained by USArray that have helped to constrain crustal and lithospheric thickness structure and stress orientations. Geodetic strain rates could potentially be used as an independent constraint on the regional seismic hazard, but only after we have corrected it for all post-seismic effects, and assessed the long-term drivers of crustal motion. We will employ a female graduate student at UNR to work on the project. We will also engage a RESESS undergraduate intern during the summer of the second year. The goal of the RESESS program is to increase diversity in the Geosciences work force. We will recruit one student from the UA Disability Resource Center (DRC) to conduct a small research project associated with the larger goals of the overall project. We will also lead an accessible field trip to the Grand Canyon for students registered at the DRC in a program that we developed and implemented in September 2015.  The goal of these activities is to draw attention to the numerous research opportunities made available by the large volume of data in NSF and other national data archives, available to a wide range of individuals. Finally, we plan to give outreach talks at the area's parks and monuments."

Inland waters, which include streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs, are also dynamic ecosystems where these substances are consumed and transformed. Among the major compounds in aquatic environments are organic molecules dissolved in the water, and they include a complex solution of individual molecules that can affect water color, drinking water quality, light availability, dissolved oxygen levels, and ecosystem function.  Nevertheless, the understanding of how these organic molecules are processed remains limited, and this is especially true for larger systems like major rivers or entire drainage networks. This issue is addressed in this graduate student research project as the  student seeks to discover how much of the organic molecules are removed by biological and non-biological processes in three streams in New England. <br/><br/>This study builds upon existing research, applies a novel field method that characterizes the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a scalable manner, and hypothesizes that biological uptake of dissolved organic matter is a relatively minor component of the total removal. This hypothesis is postulated upon the preliminary data from a method where oxygen reduction due to heterotrophy accounted for only small portion of dissolved organic matter removal in streams. The novel field method involves pulse injection of filtered maple leaf leachate into three different streams in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont where streams are constantly monitored with multi-probe sondes to detect changes in conductivity, DOM concentration, and oxygen level as the pulse of organic matter travels downstream. The solute transport data and grab samples acquired during the experiments are then used to calculate the total DOM removal, oxygen uptake due to heterotrophy, and organic matter quality change due to heterotrophy. In addition to the primary hypothesis, the preliminary data also hints at a novel priming mechanism where in-stream utilization of organic matter pulse in streams leads to boosted bioavailability by unlocking previous unavailable labile organic matter. The second hypothesis, aptly named ""self-priming,"" aims to verify the presence and mechanism of this novel concept."

Isolators are essential components for photonic integrated circuits to prevent harmful cross-talk between different parts of circuits and stabilize circuit operation. However, current optical isolators are bulky devices not compatible with integration on photonic chips. This program aims to develop the device technologies based on novel magneto-optical oxide materials to create optical isolators amenable to direct integration with silicon photonic circuits. The isolator device developed through this program will have an immediate impact in the fields of optical communications and photonic signal processing. Besides data communication, it will also play a pivotal role in emerging applications such as spintronics, magneto-optical sensing, and magnetoplasmonics. The scientific research will be tightly integrated with Massive Open Online Course development, high school, undergraduate and graduate student training, as well as educational module design for K-12 classrooms.<br/>Technical: Optical isolators, devices that allow light transmission in only one direction, are critical components of photonic integrated circuits, and exemplify a larger class of nonreciprocal optical devices. Despite their critical importance, integration of optical isolators on-chip has been a challenging task due to the large lattice constant and coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between magneto-optical oxides and common semiconductor substrates. This program aims at filling the gap by assuming a two-pronged approach involving both material engineering and device innovation. The program will develop a nonreciprocal isolator/circulator device using monolithically grown polycrystalline Cerium-doped Yttrium Iron Garnet as the magneto-optical medium, and incorporate novel device designs to enhance device performance. The research will lead to an isolator device simultaneously achieving monolithic integration, passive device operation, large isolation ratio, minimal insertion loss, and small footprint, as well as superior operation bandwidth, thus resolving the standing challenge of on-chip optical isolation."

The goal of this research is to understand and resolve the limitations that restrict the applicability and effectiveness of program profiling. The intellectual merits are to develop a complete understanding of the fundamental characteristics of program profiling, its limitations and its impact on the effectiveness of dependent optimizations, build a comprehensive and structured profiling framework to increase the efficiency and ease the adoption of profiling mechanisms during VM tasks, and set the stage for increased employment and realized benefits from adaptive optimizations in a VM.

To conduct this fundamental study, assess and demonstrate its observations, and show the benefits of more effective program profiling to improve existing VM optimizations, and to enable the creation of new adaptive VM optimizations, this work will employ three sets of real VM adaptive tasks: (a) selective compilation and feedback-directed optimizations to improve program speed, (b) heap memory management to increase performance and power efficiency, and (c) code cache management to maintain performance at lower memory utilization. This research promises to improve the performance and accessibility of managed language programs, which is very important for future computing systems as they provide an ideal programming platform in the face of growing software complexity, the best distribution format for portable Internet-based applications, and the most effective execution strategy for safe and secure execution of untrusted web services."

The complex domain of biology has causal pathways that are not always readily apparent to young children, and their explanations often contain many misconceptions and gaps in understanding. This project will add to a limited body of research on how children's recognition of information gaps influence subsequent interest in learning in formal and informal learning settings. The project will examine to what extent, if any, receiving or producing explanations motivates children's future learning, with three specific goals: (1) to examine whether children who first recognize that an explanation has significant gaps are interested in engaging in further learning of a particular topic; (2) to explore how the source of the explanation (by self or others) relates to the link between recognizing information gaps and future learning; and (3) to develop instructional strategies that can be used to induce students' recognition of explanatory gaps, measuring outcomes for these strategies, including children's subsequent ability to critically evaluate explanations and their interest in future learning. The conceptual framework will be guided by the social-cognitive theory, sociocultural theory, and mechanistic reasoning. This combined theoretical framing will promote a better assessment of which processes drive children's explanation evaluation - a crucial part of learning from others - and how mechanistic explanations can be useful lenses for analyzing the interactions of domain-specific (prior knowledge) and domain-general knowledge about learning.<br/><br/>This project will use laboratory-based quantitative methods and classroom-based teaching experiments. The quantitative methods include ANCOVAs of multiple covariates about a model that will be developed and implemented to explain developmental, individual, and task differences in responses to information gaps in scientific explanations. Behavioral measures will include ratings of explanation quality and individual difference measures, such as self-reported interest, biological knowledge, and interest in acquiring new information. Based on results from laboratory studies, scaffolds will be developed for classroom contexts to support children's productive engagement in critically evaluating biological explanations. A subset of the above measures will be use to collect pre-post data from classroom participants. Conjecture mapping will be used to conceptualize specific links between scaffolds, mediating processes, and outcomes. Classroom video and observations will be used to determine the extent to which the design scaffolds lead to the hypothesized mediating processes and ultimately the desired learning outcomes of effective evaluation and generation of mechanistic explanations of biological phenomena. Outcomes from these studies will advance scientific understanding of young children's explanation evaluation and construction, as well as provide a suite of scaffolds to support effective education practice. Combining lab and classroom-based research will lead to the development of more ecologically-valid methodologies for studying, and impacting, learning behaviors in ways that are beneficial to interdisciplinary research and education. Insights from the research will be beneficial to parents, children and teachers in both formal and informal settings. Finally, the project will provide insight into creating developmentally-appropriate interventions to help determine whether children of a certain age might benefit from instruction focused on recognizing explanatory gaps in order to motivate them to seek out better answers."

Chemical bonds themselves are electrons shared between atoms and can be thought of as a glue holding the atoms in a molecule together. The electron-glue analogy, however, only goes so far, because a bond can be weakened by both too little and too much glue, and weak bonds can be cleaved during the permanent motion of the atoms. In other words, adding an electron to a molecule generally weakens its bonds, and the resulting so-called temporary anion may undergo either bond cleavage or, alternatively, reemit the extra electron. Concrete examples where this reaction is applied or happens naturally are: plasma chemistry and plasma etching, chemistry in the ionosphere, damage to living tissue by ionizing radiation, cancer therapy with electron beams, and reduction reactions with solvated electrons, the so-called Birch reduction.  This research project supports the development of computer models of the temporary anion, the first intermediate formed in these electron-induced reactions.  This research is carried out with collaborators and with undergraduate researchers.  In order to introduce undergraduates to this research, Dr. Sommerfeld also designs educational mini-projects, which are only indirectly related to the current main project, but can be addressed with standard quantum chemistry methods, so that his students can be introduced to the research area step-by-step. <br/><br/>In this project Dr. Sommerfeld studies electronically metastable states - so called resonance states or, simply, resonances. On the one hand, he develops ab initio methods to characterize resonances, and on the other hand he applies the newly developed methods in selected applications. Computing both the energy and finite lifetime of a resonance is still a notoriously challenging task for quantum chemistry, because it combines an electron-scattering with an electron-correlation problem. To address the continuum aspect, Dr. Sommerfeld either uses complex-absorbing-potentials or the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method.  To address the correlation aspect, he uses the symmetry-adapted-cluster configuration-interaction method, an electronic structure method closely related to the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method. One particular point of emphasis is the artificial stabilizing potential added to the Hamiltonian in the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method. Dr. Sommerfeld aims to identify a short-range stabilizing potential that improves the subsequent analytic-continuation step. On the application side Dr. Sommerfeld's goals are to examine resonance states, which differ in electronic structure from a closed-shell neutral either by one-hole (Auger-like resonances) or by one excitation (e.g. Penning ionization or resonant photodetachment). For these resonances, treating electron correlation in a balanced way is particularly challenging.  Dr. Sommerfeld studies temporary anion resonances embedded in small molecule clusters with the goal of identifying trends in the change of the resonance parameters associated with the interaction strength (permanent dipole, higher order multipoles, dispersion) of the embedding molecules."

In the first theme, lecturers discuss questions such as how the classical arbitrage pricing can be modified to reflect funding costs and counterparty risk, and how market imperfections lead to nonlinearities in wealth dynamics, affecting pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. These questions are naturally related to backward stochastic differential equations, which also are studied in the summer school. The second theme deals with relevant topics in market microstructure, by both providing a practical point of view to construct and analyze effective trading algorithms and developing the underlying mathematical theory using stochastic optimal control.

In addition, the project will help Morgan State University build its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of their undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Within the larger goal of expanding queries for information retrieval, the project will 1) use a crowdsourcing based approach to perform large scale manual annotation of visual regions of interest (ROIs) by pairing automatically detected ROIs to concepts occurring in a brief caption, 2) use a feature learning approach to extract discriminative features from ROIs and automatically map the ROIs to concepts in an existing textual ontology, such as RadLex, 3) aided by a visual ontology, consider the semantic relations between the visual words when assessing the distance between images described with the bag-of-visual-words feature representation scheme, 4) in addition to cross modal search by mapping image regions to concepts in ontology, perform multimodal search by fusing weighted text and image features generated by a multi-response linear regression (MLR)-based meta-learner in a classification-driven task-specific manner, and 5) evaluate the retrieval techniques using benchmark and realistic datasets by participating in the yearly ImageCLEF retrieval evaluation campaign.  The labeled set of biomedical images with annotated regions of interest will be made available to the research community."

The development of a single particle mid-infrared absorption microscope advances the ultrasensitive quantitative identification of samples.  Potential uses include the detection of single virus particles, which is an important research topic given its close connection to human health and homeland security.  An outreach program developed by Professor Masaru Kuno for area middle schools allows students and teachers to explore infrared imaging using low cost heat imagers now available for smartphones.  This smartphone application enables the students to explore and see the practical uses of blackbody radiation (light that is emitted depending on a body's temperature).<br/><br/>Basic science problems to be addressed by Professor Kuno include investigating the intraband and intersubband transitions of individual semiconductor nanostructures.  This research focuses on the use of Single-particle infrared absorption measurements.  Such meansurements are distinguished from existing single particle microscopies in that they operate in the mid-infrared fingerprint region and exceed the optical diffraction limit.  The infrared technique is multimodal and enables both visible and infrared single particle absorption measurements.  The technique is inherently fast and can rapidly acquire large area infrared images (centimeters) as well as spectra.  The infrared absorption measurements can ultimately be applied to specimens under native conditions without the need for additional sample enrichment or purification.  This research is an important  given the potential applications of the materials in infrared photodection.

This work predominantly has focused on how the song system allows male songbirds to learn and produce song. The role of this circuit in female songbirds, which do not sing, has largely been ignored. Rather than acting as a circuit that generates vocal behavior, this work investigates the hypothesis that the ""song system"" in females serves to organize preferences for males' songs and guides their behavioral reactions to song in the form of a copulation solicitation display that ensures survival of the species. The project capitalize on the robustness, selectivity, and social malleability of the copulatory behavior in the brown-headed cowbird, to investigate how the song system transforms a sensory stimulus (the song) into a motor command that controls a postural response. The project also provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in interdisciplinary research, and it includes science education activities aimed at elementary school children as well as a comprehensive summer course in neuroscience for high school students.<br/><br/>The proposed work integrates disparate fields of science, including neuroscience, behavior, and engineering to provide unique insight into the evolution of neural circuits that control behavior. In the first aim, the investigators use a combination of classic pathway tracing techniques and recently developed transsynaptic tracer (vesicular stomatitis virus) to map the connectivity from the forebrain to the individual muscle groups that are activated during the production of a copulation solicitation display (CSD). In the second aim, the investigators record neural activity in forebrain song control nuclei HVC and RA during the production of CSD in female cowbirds to quantify the nature of the forebrain motor commands that control this highly selective sexual behavior. To evaluate the relationship between recorded neural activity patterns and the behavior, we will use a computer vision approach to quantify the copulatory behavior. In the final aim of the proposal, the investigators record neural responses to song in higher-order auditory forebrain areas (NCM, NIf, CM) within the context of CSD production. These experiments serve to test the hypothesis that these forebrain areas, which have known projections to song control nuclei, encode song valence and provide a direct link between song quality and the females' behavioral response. The neural and behavioral data will be made available at public internet site dedicated to Song Bird Science."

If glacial ice was responsible for forming them, then those landscapes must have developed primarily over the last 2-3 million years when ice was present at those latitudes; this timing has only recently been confirmed by observations.  In contrast, the Antarctic Peninsula, which contains similarly spectacular topographic relief, is known to have hosted alpine glaciers as early as 37 million years ago, and is currently covered by ice.  Thus, if caused by glacial erosion, the high relief of the peninsula should have formed much earlier than what has been observed at mid latitude sites, yet we know nearly nothing about the timing of its development.  The primary benefit of this research will be to study the timing of topography development along the Antarctic Peninsula by applying state of the art chemical analyses to sediments collected offshore.  This research is important because studying a high latitude site will enable comparison with sites at mid latitudes and test current hypotheses on the development of glacial landscapes in general.<br/><br/>This project aims to apply low-temperature thermochronometry based on the (U-Th)/He system in apatite to investigate the exhumation history, the development of the present topography, and the pattern of glacial erosion in the central Antarctic Peninsula. A number of recent studies have used this approach to study the dramatic, high-relief landscapes formed by Pleistocene alpine glacial erosion in temperate latitudes: New Zealand, the Alps, British Columbia, Alaska, and Patagonia. These studies have not only revealed when these landscapes formed, but have also provided new insights into the physical mechanisms of glacial erosion. The Antarctic Peninsula is broadly akin to temperate alpine landscapes in that the dominant landforms are massive glacial troughs. However, what we know about Antarctic glacial history suggests that the timing and history of glacial erosion was most likely very different from the temperate alpine setting: The Antarctic Peninsula has been glaciated since the Eocene, and Pleistocene climate cooling is hypothesized to have suppressed, rather than enhanced, glacial erosion. Our goal is to evaluate these hypotheses by developing a direct thermochronometric record of when and how the present glacial valley relief formed.  We propose to learn about the timing and process of glacial valley formation through apatite (U-Th)/He and 4He/3He measurements on glacial sediment collected near the grounding lines of major glaciers draining the Peninsula. In effect, since we cannot sample bedrock directly that is currently covered by ice, we will rely on these glaciers to do it for us."

Tropical societies and ecosystems rely heavily on monsoon rainfall, and thus understanding the origin and nature of decadal-scale hydroclimate variability is critical to understanding the dynamics at play in such systems.<br/><br/>Recent field studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggests that over the last millennium, the TRB may have contracted during the Little Ice Age (LIA)  thereby producing reduced monsoon rainfall along both the northern and southern margins of the TRB.  In contrast, paleohydrologic and modeling studies show that the global TRB shifted southward meridionally at this time, creating anti-phasing (dry/wet) of rainfall between the TRB northern and southern margins. <br/><br/>The researchers have developed a sub-decadal resolved (~4 year) late Holocene (the last 3,000 years) IASM reconstruction from cave KNI-51 that, when integrated with paleomonsoon records from Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent, reveal not only TRB contraction during the LIA, but expansion and contraction at multi-decadal to centennial time scales over the entirety of the late Holocene. <br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are to extend the KNI-51 stalagmite record through the middle and early Holocene (9,000-3,000 years ago) to examine the nature of TRB dynamics during conditions distinct from those of the late Holocene, including elevated contrasts between summer insolation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, lower eustatic sea level (and increased exposure of Indo-Pacific continental shelf), intervals of reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime. <br/><br/>To better understand atmospheric circulation associated with TRB dynamics, these proxy data will be integrated with climate dynamical analyses of the 6,000 year time slice simulations conducted within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5/Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) framework and with the newly available Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) simulations conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>The project involves the potential for a unique view of TRB variability over the last 9,000 years and provides an important test of the skill of CMIP5-class models to accurately reproduce associated Indo-Pacific atmospheric dynamics.  As the TRB is closely tied to tropical methane production, this research will help refine estimates of regional tropical methane fluxes during the Holocene. The research will be conducted with extensive involvement of undergraduate students thereby providing experience in advanced paleoclimate research and data analysis techniques."

The investigator undertaking this project will undertake four research activities that address critical, overarching needs for interaction design in cartography and GIScience.  The investigator will characterize current practices in interaction map design through a content analysis of online news maps.  He will develop guidelines for interactive map design through a controlled experiment evaluating the utility of unique forms of interactivity for different map reading tasks.  He will integrate representation and interaction design principles through a second experiment evaluating the utility of interactivity for different thematic map types (e.g., choropleth, dot density, isoline, proportional symbol), and he will identify best practices for cartographic design on mobile devices through a field study evaluating mobile map designs in various application settings. <br/><br/>This Faculty Early-Career Development (CAREER) award will support a project that investigates the design of maps that are interactive and are delivered online or through mobile devices.

The project will respond to numerous calls for research about interaction design within cartography and geographic information science (GIScience), and it will contribute to the emerging and interdisciplinary science of interaction crossing human-computer interaction, information visualization, usability engineering, and visual analytics.  The project will create unique undergraduate and graduate student learning opportunities through new coursework and design apprenticeships, and it will produce several open-access, publicly available products, including an extensible web mapping code repository, a blog with design and technical instructional material, and an electronic textbook on interactive cartography.

The proposing group was the first to demonstrate the degradation of porous silicon nanoparticles to non-toxic silicic acid byproducts in-vivo and the first to demonstrate the ability of nanoparticles to be visualized in vivo using gated luminescence imaging.  The goal of the proposed research is to build on these results by combining the advantages of porous silicon nanoparticles with polycaprolactone nanofibers, thus developing drug releasing composite nanofibers that can assist in increasing neurite outgrowth and improving nervous system repair.  The nanoparticles provide protection of the therapeutics, enhance imaging potential and can be used to alter the degradation process.  The nanofibers, whose alignment can be carefully controlled, provide a regenerative substrate that serves to enhance/direct the growth of extending neurites.  In summary, if successful, the biodegradable nanofiber scaffolds, which can be easily tuned to alter scaffold degradation rate, photoluminescent intensity, therapeutic delivery, and substrate alignment, will provide an innovative and straightforward model for developing the next-generation of nanofiber scaffolds. Students involved in the research will be provided with a highly interdisciplinary education in materials chemistry, nanoscience, biomedical engineering, and biology.

The goal of this three year project is to develop composite nanofibers, in which bioactive therapeutics can be incorporated, with the aim of creating customizable tissue engineering scaffolds for nervous system repair. The proposing group was the first to demonstrate the degradation of porous silicon nanoparticles to non-toxic silicic acid byproducts in-vivo, and the first to demonstrate the ability of nanoparticles to be visualized in vivo using gated luminescence imaging. The aim of this proposal will be accomplished by developing and systematically studying biodegradable porous Si/polycaprolactone composite fibers with a focus on engineering scaffolds for nervous system repair. The research is pursued under 4 main thrusts: 1) fabricate aligned or randomly oriented porous Si nanoparticle/polycaprolactone composite nanofiber scaffolds and determine photoluminescent properties and degradation of the scaffolds; 2) functionalize the surface of the porous Si/polycarpolactone nanofiber composites to improve cellular attachment and growth (including -OH and peptide functionalization) 3) incorporate and monitor release of bioactive therapeutics from the nanofiber composites that target the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to enhance neurite extension (i.e. nerve growth factor, PTEN siRNA, and PTEN inhibitor) and 4) determine ability of nanofibers to enhance neurite extension (dosal root ganglion neurons)in vitro.  Three key innovations of this research are the use of an airbrush method to fabricate nanofiber composites, utilizing photolumiscent properties of porous Si nanoparticles to monitor degradation of the composite scaffolds, and incorporating sensitive therapeutics into nanofiber composites to enhance neurite extension.  If successful, the approach will have applications in medical therapeutics, tissue engineering, and implantable scaffold imaging and broadly impact research areas of implantable biomaterials, MEMS, and controlled drug release.  Students involved in the research will be provided with a highly interdisciplinary education in materials chemistry, nanoscience, biomedical engineering, and biology, in preparation for a variety of challenging research positions in the biotech sectors of industry, government, and academia.

The multicore revolution is currently undergoing a wave of innovation in the form of heterogeneous processing elements -- processing elements that may differ with respect to functionality or processing speed.   The presence of such heterogeneity means that choices must be made when allocating hardware resources to software components. The need to resolve such choices adds considerable complexity to resource allocation, and inhibits the adoption of such platforms by the embedded computing industry despite significant potential benefits in terms of balancing performance and energy usage requirements.<br/><br/>This project will develop methodologies for implementing time-critical software upon heterogeneous platforms by systematically examining different models of heterogeneity, devising efficient real-time scheduling algorithms for each such model, and obtaining appropriate analysis techniques for each model that enable real-time constraints to be verified.   Workloads will be modeled as data-flows that enable the representation of varying degrees of parallelism, with various possible combinations of constraints on preemptivity, inter-processor migration, et cetera, considered.<br/><br/>This project both addresses fundamental scientific challenges in resource allocation theory, and seeks to develop appropriate software tools and methodologies to facilitate the adoption of results and insights that are obtained.

The ultimate goal of this project is to determine how animals navigate in dynamic environments to advance our understanding of the perceptual, learning, and memory mechanisms underlying navigation. The outcomes of this research provide an understanding of dynamic control systems, reveal how the nervous system has evolved to handle unpredictability, and drive the development of novel navigational algorithms and biological sensors.  This project is designed to provide learning and research opportunities to expand interdisciplinary education for underrepresented groups in the STEM majors. The investigator integrates this research into curriculum at multiple levels: (i) an introductory module that engages first-year biology students to use models and simulations to understand how animals move through the world; (ii) the development of a summer research program that recruits undergraduate students; (iii) the establishment of collaboration with high-school biology teachers to help establish the interdisciplinary approach to biology education before students enter university.<br/><br/>Insect navigation studies have a long history, but the mechanisms of control in changing naturalistic environments remain relatively unexamined. An integrative approach is used to elucidate how perception of the environment is computed and stored in the nervous system and acted upon by an organism. There are three major aims in the proposed research:  (i) identify the local and global visual features that ants extract from naturalistic panoramic scenes; (ii) determine how the viewing behavior of ants comes to be directed towards the local and global cues used for route guidance; (iii) define the role of memory in stabilizing routes in the face of change. The proposed research brings the unpredictable nature of the field into the lab by employing virtual naturalistic environments in which complexity and instability can be introduced in a systematic fashion.  For example, the investigator can add, remove, or displace the visual features within a scene in a closed-loop fashion simulating natural occurring changes in lighting conditions, wind displacement, and terrain geometry. This research is of general interest to visual and behavioral neuroscientists and to computer scientists working with autonomous robots.  Visually dependent tasks that are broadly similar across a wide variety of animals with well-developed visual systems tend to have areas of convergence in their generating algorithms (e.g. path integration, visually guided navigation), although the specific neural implementation may differ between species. Insect navigational behavior provides an ideal platform to develop precise control models to describe and simulate cellular events, neural circuits, and complex behavior."

Some of the most remarkable discoveries have related to the existence and nature of magnetism, which coexists at low temperature with superconductivity, and is strongly influenced by the density of mobile electrons at the interface. Fundamental questions about the origin and nature of magnetism at (non-magnetic) oxide interfaces are investigated using a suite of probes that combine high spatial and temporal resolution. This project seeks an increased understanding of coupled phases in oxides, greatly benefiting the oxide community as a whole. The research focuses on developing a microscopic understanding of the origin of magnetism at oxide interfaces, with a particular emphasis on the role of both localized and delocalized electrons that are otherwise confined to these interfaces.  This research combines ultrasensitive probes of magnetism at low temperature with the ability to create electronic nanostructures using conductive-atomic fore microscope lithography. A variety of complementary imaging techniques are employed to reveal magnetic properties at the oxide interface, including magnetic force microscopy , time resolved Kerr rotation, and superconducting-quantum-interference-device-on-a-tip microscopy. This unique combination of techniques, made possible by an international collaboration between the United States and Israel, is able to provide new insights into the most important outstanding physics questions concerning this remarkable material system."

A key challenge associated with the analysis of such big data is how to measure and infer complex dependence structure, which is a fundamental step in statistics and becomes more difficult owing to the data's high dimensionality and huge size. The main goal of this research project is to develop new dependence measures for quantifying dependence of large scale data sets such as temporally dependent functional data and high dimensional data, and utilize these new measures to develop novel statistical tools for conducting sparse principal component analysis, dimensional reduction, and simultaneous hypothesis testing. Building on the new dependence metrics that can capture nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence, the methodologies under development are expected to lead to more accurate prediction and inference, as well as more effective dimension reduction in the analysis of functional and high dimensional data. <br/><br/>The research consists of three projects addressing different challenges in the analysis of functional and high dimensional data. In Project 1, the investigators introduce a new operator-valued quantity to characterize the conditional mean (in)dependence of one function-valued random element given another, and apply the newly developed dependent metrics to do dimension reduction for functional time series under a new framework of finite dimensional functional data. In Project 2, the investigators explore a new dimension reduction framework for regression models with high dimensional response, which requires less stringent linear model assumptions and is more flexible in terms of capturing possible nonlinear dependence between the response and the covariates. In Project 3, the investigators develop new tests for the mutual independence of high dimensional data via distance covariance and rank distance covariance using both sum of squares and maximum type test statistics. Overall, the three lines of research are all related to big data, and they touch upon various aspects of modern statistics; the project aims to push the current frontiers in areas including sparse principal component analysis, inference for dependent functional data, and high dimensional multivariate analysis to another level."

The award to Central State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project seeks to employ a Bayesian framework on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for forecasting flows of the spatial distribution of subsurface properties, such as permeability and porosity. Undergraduate students will be involved in the project and a new course in high performance computing will be developed. <br/><br/>In oil recovery, carbon dioxide sequestration, or monitoring and remediation of aquifer contamination, it is often required to forecast quantities such as the fraction of oil in the produced fluid, carbon dioxide concentration, or concentration of contaminants, using subsurface fluid flow models with limited data. In this work, a Bayesian framework on Graphics Processing Units for forecasting flows will be employed. The main objectives of the project are to: expand the subsurface characterization in an existing Bayesian framework that employs a flow simulator on GPUs; improve experimental data fitting using the Bayesian statistical framework; and extend the improved framework to include a three-dimensional flow simulator on GPUs. To improve the characterization, a huff-puff technique will be employed, which consists of injecting a tracer for a short period of time into the subsurface during the huff phase, and monitoring the tracer during the puff phase.  Additionally, an ensemble Kalman filter for integrating permeability and porosity data at different spatial scales for reconstructing fine-scale spatial distributions of permeability and porosity will be used. Through collaboration with industry, the proposed Bayesian framework can be used to detect contaminants in water aquifers equipped with sensors."

For example, plants respond to stresses imposed by limitations in water availability and pathogen infection by closing stomata- specialized pores on the leaf surface that not only function in gas exchange, but also are primary points of entry to many pathogens. Thus, in closing stomata plants restrict water loss as well as entry to potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Much in the same way that hormones regulate human cellular processes, plant hormones have been demonstrated to control plant response to changes in the environment, including the above noted response to environmental and pathogenic stressors. The long range goal of this project is to define how plant stress signals are regulated and transduced to elicit the plant immune response. To do this, the current work will use the plant stomata as a tractable marker to understand how chemical changes in a cell are perceived and ultimately transduced to regulate physical and mechanical changes in cellular movement, architecture, and shape. With this knowledge, the investigators will define the principle components that plants use to monitor their environments for potential threats, and moreover, to rapidly respond to these changes. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover mechanisms that plants use to survive, and through dissemination of the Broader Impacts, to communicate these data to society to educate general public in the area of food production and security. <br/><br/>Actin is well known for its roles in defining cell shape and powering movement of organelles and macromolecules in all eukaryotic organisms. Additionally, as a component of the immune system of both plants and animals, the actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to respond to a variety of pathogen-derived elicitors. However, the mechanism(s) underpinning the role of actin in plant immunity is lacking. This study will leverage recently developed methods and resources in the PIs' laboratories to define, using the stomatal guard cell as an experimental paradigm and a series of quantitative cell biology and genetic approaches, the contribution and role of actin as a key component of the plant immune network. Plant stomatal guard cells are an attractive, amenable, and biologically relevant cell type for further dissecting the role of actin dynamics in plant immunity. The work described herein will define the relationships that link basic physiological processes (e.g., hormone signaling, pathogen perception) to the host immune response. Anticipated impacts of this project are: 1) the elucidation of the processes that dynamically respond to and function as cellular switches between, pathogen, immunity, and hormone signaling; 2) the phospho-regulation and pathogen targeting of a key plant regulatory node that controls cytoskeletal organization and stomatal guard cell dynamics; and 3) a demonstration of a role for actin in critical stomatal-based signaling pathways."

We are at the cusp of a historic transformation of our energy system into a more sustainable form in the coming decades. Electrification of our transportation system will be an important component because, today, vehicles consume more than a quarter of our energy and emit more than a quarter of our energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2).  Electrification will not only greatly reduce CO2 emission, but EVs can also be critical resources to help integrate renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, into our electric grid.  One of the key enablers to mass EV adoption is the availability of smart charging networks.   <br/><br/>This project will design a set of novel and sophisticated algorithms that optimize a network of EV chargers, implement them in software, and pilot them in a Caltech garage where the researchers have already installed a network of programmable EV chargers.  It will serve as a prototype that validates the technology and business potential of next-generation adaptive charging network (ACN).  Compared with state of the art in the EV charging industry, ACN will enable massive deployment of smart chargers and provide the same charging capacity at a fraction of required infrastructure costs.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  At many workplaces in top EV cities in the US, there is a severe shortage of chargers relative to EVs, e.g., there is a charger for every 2-5 EVs.  In the future, this ratio should be closer to 1:1.  The bottleneck to a large-scale charging facility is, however, not the cost of electricity or chargers, but the limited capacity of electricity distribution system, as well as, in city centers, the real estate. The leading chargers in the current marketplace charge at their peak rates whenever EVs are plugged in. They cannot be deployed at scale without a prohibitively expensive upgrade of the electricity distribution system. The technologies to be developed in this project will optimally schedule the charging process of a network of adaptive chargers to satisfy energy requirements of all EVs within their deadlines without exceeding the capacity of the electricity distribution system whenever possible, and optimally and fairly allocate the available capacity among competing EVs otherwise.  The ACN therefore maximally utilizes the most expensive resources in a charging ecosystem to provide a target charging capacity at a much lower infrastructure cost, creating a compelling value proposition.<br/><br/>The project will apply tools from optimization theory, control and dynamical systems, and algorithm design.  The focus is to develop optimization software that will be ready for commercialization at the end of the project.  The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition to research and software development, the project participants will be exposed to entrepreneurship and technology transfer."

In this project, the principal investigator will endeavor to understand, in a quantitative way, the effects of curvature on such decompositions.  For example, in medical imaging, X-rays are passed through a body, and one reconstructs the density function of the body by measuring how much of the X-radiation is absorbed or scattered.  Mathematically, this process is represented by an operator, known as the X-ray transform, which averages functions along straight-line paths.  The principal investigator is working on a project that seeks to understand what happens when averages are taken along curved paths.  It is known that sufficient curvature of the paths leads to greater stability of the output, and the project aims to quantify the stabilizing effect in an intermediate case where the paths are curved, but may have flat regions.  As another example, the Fourier transform expresses a natural signal as a superposition of constant velocity waves.  If the velocities lie on a plane, then they are all aligned, and, like ocean waves formed by a steady breeze, the signal does not decay.  But if the wave velocities lie on a curved surface, such as the surface of a ball, then there is some decay.  Precisely measuring this decay is an important question in harmonic analysis, the answer to which is unknown.  The principal investigator's research lies at the interface between these situations, when the velocities lie on a surface that is nearly planar in some regions and curved in others, and she seeks to precisely quantify the rate of decay.  Such questions have potential implications to partial differential equations that arise in the study of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>The principal investigator will study curvature-related problems arising in Euclidean harmonic analysis, as well as some applications to dispersive partial differential equations.  This work will encompass three directions.  One is to prove new, curvature-independent bounds for the restriction of the Fourier transform to manifolds whose curvature vanishes along some nonempty set; another is to prove analogous results for averaging operators; finally, she will study extremizer problems and concentration compactness techniques, some having applications to partial differential equations.  As part of this project, the principal investigator will organize conferences to facilitate the dissemination of mathematical knowledge and will make a dedicated effort to improve graduate training in harmonic analysis and to increase the participation of underrepresented groups, especially women."

As smart phones, smart things, tablets and wearable devices continue to change the way we communicate, do business and access information, the demand for mobile applications has grown exponentially.  This explosive increase in demand translates into a large skills gap - there are simply more mobile application (app) development job openings than there are skilled application developers to fill them. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that there will be approximately 82,000 mobile app developer jobs for candidates with associate degrees by 2020.  The RoadMAPPS to Careers project will prepare associate degree students for mobile app developer positions that pay well above the national average, maintain a high rate of employment, and offer a range of advancement opportunities.  The 5-semester curriculum is being developed and initially offered at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), one of the nine colleges of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).  The program content and educational strategies of the curriculum are appropriate for all students, whether hearing or deaf, and can be tailored for programs requiring less than five semesters.  However, specific teaching techniques tailored to the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing students will be employed at NTID.  The project will also create a pathway to the program for middle and high school students through career awareness materials, summer camp activities and dual credit courses.  <br/><br/>The broad scope of the curriculum will integrate technical courses with business courses, general education courses, and work experiences in order to cultivate the technical, social, and work skills needed for success in today's global economy. Students will learn through instruction, hands-on exercises, labs, and learning support community activities.  They will also fulfill a required cooperative work experience and complete a capstone project where they will design and develop a publishable mobile app.  Although other colleges are offering programs in mobile app development, RoadMAPPS to Careers will introduce an innovative cross-platform approach that is especially appropriate for an associate degree program.  Students will learn the programming concepts and acquire the skills needed to create mobile apps that run on multiple platforms (iOS, Android and Windows) without being overwhelmed by learning a different programming language for each platform.  A leading developer of cross-platform technology (Xamarin) is partnering with RIT on the project.

A strong driving force in speciation is adaptation to the local environment a population resides in, which can lead to splitting gene pools apart. If two populations of the same species living in distinct environments are adapted to their local ecological conditions, offspring between the two populations may not survive as well and ultimately reduce the exchange of genetic information between populations. It is the formation of this genetic isolation that can lead populations to become different species.  This study focuses on two populations of a cactus-breeding fly, Drosophila mojavensis, which live in different environments, use different cactus species, and have distinct larval behaviors. In one population the larvae feed on small cactus pads (prickly pear) and don't move much, while the other population feeds on larger cactus (organpipe) and move more and faster. Capitalizing on the rich genetic 'toolkit' for Drosophila this study will identify the genes responsible for these differences and determine how changes at the gene level can lead to different behaviors and population isolation. Information from this research will be shared with the science community through publications and presentations.  The investigator will mentor students through research in behavioral genetics and will use the funded techniques in research-focused college courses. Also the investigator will partner with local high schools to expose students to research at the university level.<br/><br/>Understanding the evolution and underlying genetics of alternative larval behaviors could be instrumental in elucidating how adaptation to local ecological conditions can lead to the divergence of populations, speciation, and how genotypes lead to behavioral phenotypes. Ecological adaptation has a significant influence on the variation seen in behavioral strategies. In saprophytic and phytophagous insects the properties of the plant host have been shown to greatly influence the pattern of genomic, metabolomics, physiological, life history and behavioral variation. It is this divergent, ecologically-driven adaptation to a host's properties that can drive the evolution of reproductive incompatibilities between host populations and lead to the formation of species. This study will focus on the variation of larval activity, and its underlying genetic control, of the cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis. Distinct populations of D. mojavensis have nutritionally and chemically distinct cactus hosts, which are associated with different larval behaviors. The study will examine the physiology and life history consequence of the distinct behaviors and link it to the transcriptional and genomic changes between the distinct cactus host populations of D. mojavensis. A quantitative trait loci analysis will examine the genetic underpinnings of larval behavior. CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts and transgenics will be generated to quantify the functional role of the candidate behavior QTLs in an ecological context and examine the life history consequences of variation at these loci and provide a strong examination of genotype to phenotype level questions."

Understanding of how plants and their immune systems interact with pathogens and symbionts continues to rapidly advance. At the same time new understanding is emerging of how plants interact with broader populations of environmental microbes, especially resulting from the application of genomics, bioinformatics and systems biology. These new levels of understanding are leading to safer, more effective and more sustainable ways to manage plant pests and diseases in crops and natural ecosystems. The latest research findings on these topics will be presented and discussed at the 17th International Congress on Plant-Microbe Interactions in Portland, Oregon from July 17 through July 21, 2016. This grant will provide partial financial support for 20 promising U.S. students and postdoctoral scholars to attend this conference. These young scientists will participate in a small meeting workshop designed to enrich their engagement and participation. Established scientists and the supported participants will work in teams throughout the meeting to critically discuss the research findings. In addition, the students and postdocs will be contribute to the dissemination of the conference findings by releasing daily meeting highlights via social networking and publishing a final congress report. <br/><br/>Throughout its history since 1982, the International Congress on Plant-Microbe Interactions has been a unique and comprehensive congress covering both plant-pathogenic and plant-beneficial microbial interactions in both model and major crop plants, which distinguishes it from more specialized meetings. The 17th IC-MPMI will convene in Portland, Oregon from July 17 through July 21, 2016. In this meeting, the plenary and concurrent sessions will highlight the latest advances in fundamental research as well as translational studies critical for advancements in agricultural science. Highlights include a strong focus on the plant microbiome and multiway associations, a renewed focus on symbiotic associations, and new sessions on RNA-mediated interactions, population genomics, modeling and systems biology, and problems in the developing world. As with previous IC-MPMI congresses, the broader impacts of the 2016 congress will include the sharing of emerging data, the establishment and strengthening of international collaborations, and development of innovative strategies and technology to improve plant health, productivity and security. The participation of US scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, will be critical for the success and vitality of this congress. The workshop activities planned for the participants supported by this grant will enhance participation and learning by these young scientists, help them build their professional networks and communication skills, as well as inform others who are not able to attend this meeting."

Symplectic geometry is the fundamental geometry underlying classical mechanics and dynamics. The set of possible states of a macroscopic physical system is described by a symplectic manifold, and the geometry of this symplectic manifold is essential for understanding how the physical system evolves over time. Symplectic field theory (SFT), initiated in 2000 by Eliashberg-Givental-Hofer, is a major program for understanding symplectic geometry by counting pseudoholomorphic curves (a kind of area-minimizing surfaces) in symplectic manifolds, and performing these counts by cutting symplectic manifolds into simpler pieces. Since 2005, a series of workshops on particular aspects of SFT has been held at various locations in Germany, and these workshops have played a key role in the development of the subject. Each such workshop consists of a week of mini-courses, research lectures, and discussions, preceded by a weekend of introductory courses reviewing necessary background material. In August 2016, the eighth SFT workshop will be held in Berlin, and this grant will provide travel support to enable junior US-based participants to participate in the workshop.<br/><br/>The specific topic of the workshop is symplectic homology. In the past decade, symplectic homology has emerged as a central tool in symplectic and contact geometry and topology, with a number of spectacular applications. The uses of symplectic homology include distinguishing exotic Stein structures and contact structures, detecting Reeb orbits of vector fields, and obstructing Lagrangian cobordisms. In addition, a closely related invariant, the wrapped Fukaya category, plays an essential role in recent developments in mirror symmetry. This workshop will bring together the major recent advances in the structure and applications of symplectic homology, in an in-depth and coordinated manner, in order to form this vital subject into a coherent whole and make it accessible to a wider audience. The centerpiece of the workshop will consist of mini-courses by Tobias Ekholm on the Legendrian surgery formula and its applications, Alexandru Oancea on the symplectic Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and Mark McLean on wrapped Floer cohomology and affine varieties. In addition there will be five research lectures and a weekend precourse with six background talks. Sending US participants to this workshop will enable US mathematicians to keep up with the latest developments in symplectic geometry and contribute to the future of the subject.

The principle the sensor design is based on, a new transduction mechanism, may make it easier to use in practical application.  The sensor can be modified for measuring other biological entities and can potentially have very broad impact in medical diagnostics, environmental measurements and food safety.<br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on a new transduction mechanisms and design of biosensing platform using hot electron energy transfer generated by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The proposed biosensor will utilize a LSPR-based hybrid plasmon device structure consisting of the combination of both metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and a field effect transistor (FET), thereby engendering highly sensitive label-free detection of biomolecular interactions. Plasmon FET does not require bulky optical readout instrumentation, while taking advantages of plasmon based sensing. Unique characteristics such as electrically isolated plasmonic sensing surface, on-chip optical-to-electrical conversion and two-color lock-in amplifier based sensing will ensure robust sensing, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, and real-time detection of molecular interaction. This sensor design allows the reduction in size of sensing area beyond the diffraction limit of light. Thus, it has the potential to lower cost, highly sensitive and rapid detection of disease biomarkers. This proposed research will carry out: 1) development of plasmon-FET sensing platform on a glass substrate; 2) evaluation using spiked PBS and clinical samples; and 3) a multiplexed sensing demonstration using four different biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is mainly the exploration of a new promising LSPR device using efficient hot electron emission and amplification. Successful development will lead the multiplexed microchip based sensing technology for a point-of-care device and a lab-on-a-chip based sensor assay.  During the course of the project innovative materials will be developed which a focus on nanotechnology in general and nanophotonics and LSPR in particular, as well as promotion of interdisciplinary research (engineering, biochemistry and clinical research) for the graduate students, and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students."

The areas include astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The research mentors are all well funded researchers and all have committed to personally directing the students. The extensive research infrastructure, including the facilities of several large interdisciplinary centers, will be available to the students. Physics students will have the opportunity to visit major facilities at government laboratories, both domestic and international, including FermiLab, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, and CERN.<br/><br/>As part of the program's emphasis on leadership development, the program includes training in ethical conduct of research, and as part of the program's emphasis on developing the future workforce includes a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in physics. The REU program will achieve broad impact. In particular, the track record of the program over the past six years shows that a high percentage of the participants will be underrepresented minority students, and the track record moreover shows that more than half of the participants will be from institutions with limited research opportunities. Finally, to achieve sustained impact, the program is designed to build ties between the Vanderbilt mentors, all of whom are supported with appropriate salary, and faculty at the student's home institution. This builds a larger community, provides for continued support for the student, and enhances the ability for continued mentoring and research participation of the student beyond the REU site experience."

This project takes advantage of planned dam removals that will connect fish populations that have been separated for nearly four centuries, in order to study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of secondary contact between these recently divergent fish populations, which may interbreed but also may compete. Results from this work will contribute to the conservation and management of migratory alewife fish, a critical resource in coastal freshwater and marine habitats and the focus of intensive restoration and conservation efforts. Researchers will work collaboratively with state managers, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, lake associations, and land trusts to determine the consequences of restoring migratory populations, provide information vital to alewife recovery, and educate local communities on the consequences of river restoration. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher along with graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary project that relies on advanced genetics techniques, field sampling, and manipulative field and laboratory experiments. An existing program at Yale University will support involvement of underrepresented minority undergraduate students in summer research. Training will include the broader scientific context of the research, research methods, data analysis, written and oral project reports, and direct involvement with the public to present the societal benefits of the research. <br/><br/>This project takes advantage of whole-lake restoration projects to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of secondary contact between recently diverged lineages of alewife. Isolation caused by construction of dams has resulted in two divergent alewife life history forms: the ancestral anadromous form that moves between lakes and the coastal ocean and a landlocked form that is resident in lakes. This project will combine advanced genomics, small-scale experiments, and whole-lake observations and experiments to document and understand the consequences of secondary contact, when dam removal allows reintroduction of anadromous alewife into lakes that contain the land-locked form. Close collaboration with the state agency that removes dams will allow the investigators to study secondary contact from its initiation. The project addresses three stages in response to secondary contact: rapid ecological change in planktonic communities and nutrient flux, rapid evolutionary responses in invertebrate populations in response to novel ecological conditions, and interactions between the two alewife morphs that may result in hybridization and, over the longer-term, alewife evolution and local adaptation. The first of these responses - ecological changes in lacustrine communities - is essential in order to interpret the evolutionary changes that result. The project is unique in its ability to capture the consequences of secondary contact on both time scales. Results will provide rare insight into feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in field populations following secondary contact with important implications for ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity in restored ecosystems."

Several major Antarctic outlet glaciers and ice streams will be investigated using a suite of observational techniques and modeling tools. Glaciers include Thwaites Glacier, which has become a focal point in the discussion of West Antarctic retreat, Whillans Ice Stream as an example of the archetype ice stream, and Byrd Glacier, a major outlet glacier draining East Antarctica through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Ice Shelf. This study will investigate whether the ongoing changes in these glaciers will lead to long-term mass loss (the onset of ice sheet collapse), or whether these glaciers will quickly stabilize with a new geometry.<br/><br/>To adequately incorporate the dynamic behavior of outlet glaciers and ice streams requires inclusion of the relevant physical processes, and the development of regional models that employ a numerical grid with a horizontal grid spacing sufficiently refined to capture smaller-scale bed topographic features that may control the flow of these glaciers. This award revisits the issue of stability of marine-terminating glaciers whose grounding line is located on a retrograded bed slope. In particular, an attempt will be made to resolve the question whether observed rapid changes are the result of perturbations at the terminus or grounding line, or whether these changes reflect ice-dynamical forcing over the grounded reaches. High-resolution satellite imagery will be used to investigate ice-flow perturbations on smaller spatial scales than has been done before, to evaluate the importance of localized sites of high basal resistance on grounding-line stability. This collaborative project involves a range of modeling strategies including force-budget analysis, flow-band modeling, Full Stokes modeling for local studies, and using the Ice Sheet System Model developed at JPL for regional modeling. Broader Impacts include training two graduate students in computer simulations and ice sheet modeling algorithms. The work will also expand on a web-based interactive flowline model, so that it includes more realistic grounding line dynamics."

While many effective countermeasures have been found and applied manually, they are application-specific and labor intensive. In addition, security evaluation tends to be incomplete, with no guarantee that all the vulnerabilities in the target system have been identified and addressed by such manual countermeasures. This SaTC project aims to shift the paradigm of side-channel attack research, and proposes to build an automation framework for information leakage analysis, multi-level countermeasure application, and formal security evaluation against software side-channel attacks.<br/><br/>The proposed framework provides common sound metrics for information leakage, methodologies for automatic countermeasures, and formal and thorough evaluation methods. The approach unifies power analysis and cache-based timing attacks into one framework. It defines new metrics of information leakage and uses them to automatically identify possible leakage of a given cryptosystem at an early stage with no implementation details. The conventional compilation process is extended along the new dimension of optimizing for security, to generate side-channel resilient code and ensure its secure execution at run-time. Side-channel security is guaranteed to be at a certain confidence level with formal methods. The three investigators on the team bring complementary expertise to this challenging interdisciplinary research, to develop the advanced automation framework and the associated software tools, metrics, and methodologies. The outcome significantly benefits security system architects and software developers alike, in their quest to build verifiable SCA security into a broad range of applications they design. The project also builds new synergy among fundamental statistics, formal methods, and practical system security. The automation tools, when introduced in new courses developed by the PIs, help improving students' hands-on experience greatly. The project also leverages the experiential education model of Northeastern University to engage undergraduates, women, and minority students in independent research projects."

Temperature depth-profiles are of particular current interest for estimating basal temperature and geothermal heat flux in Antarctica. Antarctic geothermal heat flux is presently poorly known except at recent drilling sites, and is the largest unknown in determining basal conditions. However, current logistical costs greatly limit drilling to acquire temperature profiles. Our long-term goal is the development, testing and commissioning of a new means of acquiring englacial temperature profiles at much lower costs than existing methods.  To that end, we will undertake laboratory experiments and numerical modeling to develop to a new way to use ice melt probes, rather than traditional drilling, to deploy temperature measurement equipment to depths of a kilometer and greater.  To use melt probes for this purpose, we must keep the melted ice above such probes from freezing completely, so that cable can be fed continually down to the probe as it descends.  This development will also open the way toward recovering melt probes, so as to prevent environmental impacts and expense of equipment left in the field.  Our initial experiments and modeling will test the validity of our approach and make it ready for further testing in the field.  <br/><br/>Technical Description: We will undertake laboratory and modeling work (1) to reduce the technical risk in our approach to melt-probe deployment of Raman Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) cables; and (2) to begin development of a recoverable ice melt probe. Specifically, we will use numerical modeling of the Stefan problem with cylindrical symmetry to guide detailed designs for cable-heating and anti-freeze injection, and will test and revise candidate designs by means of laboratory testing.  We will test the long-term stability of ethanol-filled melt holes, to gauge their suitability for recoverable melt probe systems for temperature measurement (where months-long thermal equilibration after installation will be required).  We will gain experience with Raman DTS methods by employing DTS to measure critical temperature data in our laboratory experiments, both within the melt hole and in adjacent ice. To address recoverability, we will design and test a new melt head for the upper end of our ice melt probe, and demonstrate upward travel through a partially refrozen melt hole.  Finally, we will publish both modeling and experimental results in peer-reviewed publications, and will present the project to a broad public audience in a special event at a Seattle museum of science and technology.  The result of this work will be demonstrated technical readiness for testing in a subsequent project at larger ice-drilling test facilities at the earliest opportunity (prospectively, at the University of Wisconsin, following soon after completion of this project) and, following that, in the field."

These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or ""chokepoints"", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.<br/><br/>Christopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world. Each member of the team is an expert in their region of study. Each will focus on a particular kind of chokepoint. These include: the Panama Canal, a tunnel in Russia, a land bridge in India, an oil-refinery and pipelines in Ecuador, a network of rivers in Bangladesh, and a maritime strait leading into the Red Sea. The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest. The results will speak directly to current concerns over migration, security, and economic wellbeing.  In doing so, this project promises to alter the ways governments, industries, and others understand and engage with these critical transit points of the world today."

Biomass consists mainly of the carbohydrate polymers cellulose and hemicellulose, and the complex phenolic polymer lignin.  The cellulosic biorefinery is in emerging platform for large-scale biofuels production that converts the cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions to sugars, which are then fermented to produce bioethanol.  A byproduct of this process is the residual lignin in the plant biomass.   After cellulose, lignin is the second-most abundant biopolymer on Earth and accounts for 15-40% of plant biomass.  Although lignin is an energy-rich material, it is difficult to convert into biofuels and is often simply burned for heat, a relatively low-value application of this resource.  A cost-effective method for utilizing lignin is needed to improve economic viability and environmental sustainability of the biorefinery.  This project seeks to convert the lignin into a biofuel feedstock by an innovative two-step process.  The first process converts the lignin byproduct into a dense oil by heating it up in the absence of air, a process called pyrolysis, and the second process uses bacteria to break down the complex pyrolysis oils to aromatic compounds which can be made into fuels and chemicals.   The educational activities associated with this project include hands-on outreach activities for middle and high-school students on the topics related to biomass utilization using Lego toys which resemble biomass biopolymers.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research is to develop and gain fundamental understanding of a hybrid pyrolysis-bioconversion process to make biofuel precursors from biorefinery residual lignin. The proposed process enables the bioconversion of lignin-derived phenolic monomers to fuels and chemicals in a two-step process.  The first step focuses on the thermocatalytic depolymerization of lignin into heterogeneous phenolic monomers. In the second step, the various monomers generated by lignin pyrolysis are then microbially converted into the catechol and protocatechute, which enter central metabolism and are then converted into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, two key metabolic precursors for the production of various advanced biofuels and chemicals.  The project has three research objectives. The first objective is to characterize of the lignin monomers derived from the fast pyrolysis process.  The second objective is to study the capability of selected bacterial strains to utilize these lignin monomers, and then explore how tailoring the conditions of the pyrolysis process makes beneficial changes in the pyrolysis oil that improves the bioconversion efficiency of the lignin monomers.  This will be accomplished in part by emulsifying the lignin monomers in an aqueous phase and strain engineering of bacteria for improved performance.  The third objective is to develop a bench-scale fermentation process for accomplishing objective 2 in a scalable platform, and then use this information for preliminary techno-economic and life-cycle analyses."

For instance, the predictive power of large-scale evolutionary trees plays an important role in leading advances in human health, increasing agricultural production, and to inform decisions about natural resource management. Despite these promises, inferring such large trees from genetic data is confronting the computational biology community with the most challenging and complex computational problems in evolutionary biology today. Tree assembly problems have emerged as a powerful tool to address these challenges. The project investigates such problems that, given a collection of typically smaller evolutionary trees, seek an assembled tree that reconciles the overall conflict in these input trees. This conflict is often measured by a problem-specific tree comparison measure. Mathematical and computational properties of such measures play a critical role in the efficient computation, credibility, and analysis of assembled trees, and therefore, are the focal research point of the project. Scalability and accuracy of the methods developed in the project will be analyzed in practice using data provided by phylogenetic databases. <br/><br/>Research results will be widely disseminated within the computational biology and evolutionary biology communities. Graduate and undergraduate training opportunities offered through the project will enrich the educational experience of students through extensive interdisciplinary collaborations by acquiring a balanced perspective of biological, mathematical, and algorithmic challenges in evolutionary biology. Underrepresented minorities will be engaged through presentations in the bioinformatics programs at Iowa State University dedicated to such minorities, incorporating minority students into the project through rotations and research assistantships, and by attracting minority students to the field of computational biology and bioinformatics through public events at Iowa State University, like Major Fairs, or the student organized Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Symposia. The project will also engage in computational thinking workshops at Iowa State University for K-12 students by involving topics in computational biology and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>The developed methods will enable biologists to assemble larger and more credible evolutionary trees. The ability of these methods to handle unrooted and possibly erroneous evolutionary trees will largely extend on their applicability in practice. Evolutionary tree assembly often relies on comparison metrics and their largest possible distances, called diameters. Identifying diameters for tree comparison measures and computing these diameters efficiently will allow for compensation of shape-biases that can radically alter the outcome of tree assembly methods. For several comparison measures only weak upper bounds on their diameters are known, and the research will investigate into tightening these bounds. Identified properties of assembly methods will support biologists in their difficult choice of appropriate assembly methods. Such properties will also lead to mathematical characterizations and parameterizations of efficiently solvable instances of tree assembly methods. Novel linear time algorithms that provide evaluations of all possible rootings under various tree comparison measures will support biologists in their challenging task of identifying such rootings accurately. Finally, the theoretical results of the research will advance the algorithmic foundations of tree assembly and comparative phylogenetics."

Multinational investments in geophysical infrastructure over the last few decades, especially broadband seismometers operating for several years, are allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes. To specifically leverage those past investments, we will analyze past and current data to gain a better understanding of Antarctic seismicity. Our recent research revealed that certain large earthquakes occurring elsewhere in the world triggered ice movement near various stations throughout Antarctica. We plan to conduct an exhaustive search of the terabytes of available data, using cutting-edge computational techniques, to uncover additional evidence for ice crevassing, ice stream slip, and earth movement during earthquakes. One specific focus of our research will include investigating whether some of these phenomena may be triggered by external influences, including passing surface waves from distant earthquakes, ocean tides, or seasonal melt. We plan to produce a catalog of the identified activity and share it publicly, so the public and researchers can easily access it. To reach a broader audience, we will present talks to high school classes, including Advanced Placement classes, in the Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas with emphasis on general aspects of seismic hazard, climate variability, and the geographies of Antarctica. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, training for graduate students, and support for an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>In recent years, a new generation of geodetic and seismic instrumentation has been deployed as permanent stations throughout Antarctica (POLENET), in addition to stations deployed for shorter duration (less than 3 years) experiments (e.g. AGAP/TAMSEIS). These efforts are providing critical infrastructure needed to address fundamental questions about both crustal-scale tectonic structures and ice sheets, and their interactions.  We plan to conduct a systematic detection of tectonic and icequake activities in Antarctica, focusing primarily on background seismicity, remotely-triggered seismicity, and glacier slip events. Our proposed tasks include: (1) Identification of seismicity throughout the Antarctic continent for both tectonic and ice sources. (2) An exhaustive search for additional triggered events in Antarctica during the last ~15 years of global significant earthquakes. (3) Determination of triggered source mechanisms and whether those triggered events also occur at other times, by analyzing years of data using a matched-filter analysis (where the triggered local event is used to detect similar events). (4) Further analysis of GPS measurements over a ~5.5 year period from Whillans Ice Plain, which suggests that triggering of stick-slip events occurred after the largest earthquakes. An improved knowledge of how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to external perturbations such as dynamic stresses from large distant earthquakes and recent ice unloading could lead to a better understanding of ice failure and related dynamic processes. By leveraging the vast logistical investment to install seismometers in Antarctica over the last decade, our project will build an exhaustive catalog of tectonic earthquakes, icequakes, calving events, and any other detectable near-surface seismic phenomena."

Plasmas are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids, and gases) and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. Since plasmas are charged gases, they serve as excellent conductors of electricity, and thus are of great practical interest. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, the use of plasmas within nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently of immense scientific interest.  Other notable examples of plasmas include the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also be particularly useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of ""space weather"", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting the Earth. In general, the motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated partial differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project are to demonstrate that these equations possess realistic solutions, determine their qualitative behavior, compute their sensitivity with respect to model parameters (such as masses, charges, and temperature), and computationally approximate them so that one can accurately predict outcomes in future situations.<br/><br/><br/>A plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are often strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting, collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity averages of solutions to the Vlasov equation. One major question this project will study is: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist.  Similarly, the associated Fokker-Planck system will be studied to further elucidate the smoothing influence of collisions on the particle distribution. Another problem to be investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge density and electromagnetic field in the system.  More specifically, do dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity?  Finally, the sensitivity of fields and densities with respect to model input parameters will be computed using global sensitivity metrics and particle-in-cell simulations."

To accomplish targeted delivery, the compounds of interest will be encapsulated in nanoparticles.  Protists, which are single-cell microbes that are abundant in soil, can spontaneously engulf nanoparticles and carry them through soil.

The project will develop nanoencapsulation technology that is compatible with protist uptake and transport.  The benefits of the research will be increased efficiency, reduced costs and reduced impact of chemical use in agriculture, all of which can increase crop production and promote sustainability of the farming enterprise.  Students at various academic levels will participate in the project, and the project will be used as a platform for outreach activities for Connecticut high school teachers participating in the Early College Experience program.<br/><br/>Flash nanoprecipitation and inverse flash nanoprecipitation will be used for efficient, economic and scalable production of biocompatible particles.

The question is whether similar decompositions are possible in such cases, with the sines and cosines replaced by other functions of a simple structure. The goal is to use functions that mimic the structure of the sines and cosines, in one way or another, as good replacements for the trigonometric functions, which provide an excellent tool for studying properties of functions and the interrelationships between them.

The research focuses on the basic biology of the limb progenitor, but is also of great national interest because it will advance efforts to use the limb progenitor as the source for generating limbs de novo, with utility for amputees of war, trauma or congenital defects. To date, no one has been able to generate such a cell type. This research gives us the foundation to interrogate the true limb progenitor functionally, genomically and on the chromatin level, and provides a clear understanding of how this 3D structure is generated. <br/><br/>Aside from scientific endeavors, these funds are also being used to translate the potential of modern science to the general public and to recruit traditionally underrepresented minorities to science.  To this end, three active approaches are being utilized to increase awareness and to recruit minority students. The first is mentoring - each summer students from underrepresented groups are recruited through the Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program (SHURP), a program at Harvard that recruits underrepresented undergraduate biology students to do research in a host lab for a summer. The second is involvement in the community - each year the Fellow helps to judge poster presentations for the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) conferences.  The third is more traditional but important - by publishing good science in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, the Fellow is increasing the awareness of the research, providing an effective microphone for showing that modern science is on the verge of being able to generate the basis for the mammalian limb."

Taken together, a new device is expected to be created for the rapid detection of numerous disease biomarkers.<br/><br/>This work will investigate a low-cost label-free sensing technology that focuses on analytes that can quickly diagnose illnesses and toxins prevalent in impoverished populations.  The researchers aim to accomplish this by combining the cooperative phase transitions of liquid crystals with the flexibility of aptamer-based analyte binding.  Liquid crystal based biosensors are inexpensive and sensitive, but the label-free application of the homeotropic to planar phase change requires a change in the interfacial packing of the nematic mesogen, restricting applications to a narrow range of targets.  In contrast, aptamers possess the ability to selectively bind to a wide range of analytes, and the ability to quickly evolve new targets using Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential (SELEX) enrichment has made the nucleic acid recognition elements a popular topic in the sensing community.  Still, the challenge remains to translate this easily evolvable selectivity into an inexpensive label-free ""aptasensor.""  The goal of this work is to examine the fundamental interfacial science and aptamer sequence space needed to robustly couple the nematic liquid crystal-aqueous interface with aptamer selectivity and sensitivity.  Our approach for creating a ""generalizable"" aptamer-liquid crystal system investigates in the proposed work, four fundamental aspects of the sensing system.  (1) Develop a quantitative methodology for the evaluation of competitive adsorption to the nematic liquid crystal-aqueous interface.  (2) Measure and model the change in surface energy as the liquid responds to surfactants, unbound aptamers and bound aptamers.  (3) Determine the rate limiting steps for realistic sensor design, where the kinetics of the phase transition should not require protracted diffusive or adsorption times.

Photon beams are being explored to process information, probe the nature of solids and understand how the brain responds to and interacts with external stimuli. New semiconductors that interact with light in unusual ways often form the cornerstone for enhancing the effective coupling of photons to matter. The project investigates the potential of new semiconducting oxide systems in emerging photonic devices. The research goal is to explore optical and electronic properties of thin film SmNiO3 that has a controllable phase change near room temperature that can be systematically induced by changing the electronic structure for potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as optical modulators and optical memories. The project is collaborative between materials scientists and photonics engineers to bring multi-disciplinary skills together to work on cutting-edge topics in nanophotonics incorporating new thin film oxide materials. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the intersection between materials science, nanophotonics, and optoelectronics. The project engages diverse students in interdisciplinary research that encompasses materials growth, device design, computer modeling, cleanroom nanofabrication, and optical/electronic characterization of materials/devices. <br/><br/>Technical Description: This project investigates the potential of electron-doped perovskites as novel phase-changing materials for future light modulation devices needed for optical memory, brain-inspired photonic devices with multiple states. The research goals of this collaborative project are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and reliability of non-volatility of the electron incorporation process and to understand the limits on the speed of phase change studied by optical routes. The research team uses a combination of thin film materials synthesis, electron diffraction, carrier transport measurements, optical microscopy and spectroscopy to study the nanostructure and optical properties of selected perovskite oxides. The research team uses ?metasurfaces?, which are two-dimensional arrays of optical antennas, to maximize the interaction between intensely confined light and thin films of phase-change materials.

These sites routinely gather data pertaining to end user activities to provide better services, and they collect server monitoring logs and performance counters to ensure uninterrupted service. Although fast, efficient, and cost-effective analyses of these large datasets can significantly improve users' quality of experience and enable novel applications, the wide area network (WAN) that connects the datacenters poses a considerable challenge: because WAN bandwidth is limited and expensive, and WAN latency is high and variable, both the performance and timeliness of analytics are affected by the WAN.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a new WAN-aware big data stack customized for flexible geo-distributed data analytics. The project will not impose any constraints on the set of queries that can be issued, and it will support a variety of performance objectives including obtaining timely responses, minimizing batch completion times, or using minimal bandwidth. To account for unpredictable and fine-timescale changes to WAN conditions and to enable coordination among the actions taken by different layers of the analytics stack, this project will enable holistic, cross-layer visibility and optimizations. It will incorporate awareness of the geo-distributed setting in the stack's upper layers (e.g., query optimization) and of application-level objectives in the lower layers (e.g., networking). This will result in a radical re-factoring of the API and interfaces between query optimization, query execution, resource negotiation, wide-area storage, and network routing/scheduling.<br/><br/>Software artifacts from this project will be incorporated into existing open source big data stacks, making the research outcomes broadly available for public reuse. The experimental harnesses will be made available to ensure repeatability and to foster follow up research. The research outcomes will guide industry evolution as the industry slowly shifts from single-datacenter to geo-distributed settings. The project has a substantial educational component involving the introduction of new courses on big data systems at both graduate and undergraduate levels that will involve hands-on exercises with state-of-the-art big data software, and it will reach out to high-school students, women, and underrepresented minorities through big data boot camps."

The arc is home to about 145 volcanoes of which 52 have erupted in historic time.  The eruptive activity of these volcanoes ranges from continuous small explosions to devastatingly large eruptions such as the one that occurred at Katmai in 1912. Volcanic activity in the Aleutian Arc is a result of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate. During this process, volatile elements such as water, carbon and nitrogen that are locked up in the sediments and oceanic crust are slowly transferred into the region deep under the Aleutian Arc volcanoes.  Under high pressure the volatiles are squeezed out of the subducting plate into the overlying (mantle) region, where they help to melt rock and generate magma.  The lower density of the magma and volatiles compared to the surrounding rock allows these fluids to ascend to the Earth's surface where the magma ultimately erupts through volcanism and the gases are released to the atmosphere.  While it is well-known that volatiles play a significant role in both generating magma and influencing eruption explosivity, it is currently not well understood how the source of volatiles (subducted plate, mantle and crust) and the amount of volatiles released over time (e.g. their flux), may influence volcanic eruption size, explosivity and frequency. This project aims to constrain the process of volatile subduction and release through volcanism in the poorly studied Western Aleutians, and to provide insight into volcanic activity. <br/><br/>The Western and Central portions of the Aleutian Volcanic Arc are the ideal locations to investigate the influence of subduction angle, rate and sediment composition on magma generation and volatile flux. The subduction rate and sediment flux increases along the arc from Kiska, the western-most volcano, to Cleveland, located within the central region of the arc. Additionally, the number of historic eruptions within Central Aleutian volcanoes appears to be greater in number than compared to the Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through a previous expedition volcanic gas samples, gas emission measurements and explosively erupted lava samples were collected at five Western Aleutian volcanoes. Through this project these samples will be analyzed for their chemical and isotopic composition and measurements will be used to compute the fluxes of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen and water to the atmosphere. Constraints on the quantity and type of material subducted into the Aleutian Arc from previous studies will be compared to the composition of volatile and lava outputs, as well as the total flux of volatiles measured here, to provide insight into volatile cycling and magma generation. This information will be compared to historic data on eruption size, style and frequency for each of the target volcanoes to identify possible links between subduction character and volcanic activity, to ultimately help improve eruption forecasting and hazard mitigation."

Multinational investments in geophysical infrastructure over the last few decades, especially broadband seismometers operating for several years, are allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes. To specifically leverage those past investments, we will analyze past and current data to gain a better understanding of Antarctic seismicity. Our recent research revealed that certain large earthquakes occurring elsewhere in the world triggered ice movement near various stations throughout Antarctica. We plan to conduct an exhaustive search of the terabytes of available data, using cutting-edge computational techniques, to uncover additional evidence for ice crevassing, ice stream slip, and earth movement during earthquakes. One specific focus of our research will include investigating whether some of these phenomena may be triggered by external influences, including passing surface waves from distant earthquakes, ocean tides, or seasonal melt. We plan to produce a catalog of the identified activity and share it publicly, so the public and researchers can easily access it. To reach a broader audience, we will present talks to high school classes, including Advanced Placement classes, in the Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas with emphasis on general aspects of seismic hazard, climate variability, and the geographies of Antarctica. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, training for graduate students, and support for an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>In recent years, a new generation of geodetic and seismic instrumentation has been deployed as permanent stations throughout Antarctica (POLENET), in addition to stations deployed for shorter duration (less than 3 years) experiments (e.g. AGAP/TAMSEIS). These efforts are providing critical infrastructure needed to address fundamental questions about both crustal-scale tectonic structures and ice sheets, and their interactions.  We plan to conduct a systematic detection of tectonic and icequake activities in Antarctica, focusing primarily on background seismicity, remotely-triggered seismicity, and glacier slip events. Our proposed tasks include: (1) Identification of seismicity throughout the Antarctic continent for both tectonic and ice sources. (2) An exhaustive search for additional triggered events in Antarctica during the last ~15 years of global significant earthquakes. (3) Determination of triggered source mechanisms and whether those triggered events also occur at other times, by analyzing years of data using a matched-filter analysis (where the triggered local event is used to detect similar events). (4) Further analysis of GPS measurements over a ~5.5 year period from Whillans Ice Plain, which suggests that triggering of stick-slip events occurred after the largest earthquakes. An improved knowledge of how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to external perturbations such as dynamic stresses from large distant earthquakes and recent ice unloading could lead to a better understanding of ice failure and related dynamic processes. By leveraging the vast logistical investment to install seismometers in Antarctica over the last decade, our project will build an exhaustive catalog of tectonic earthquakes, icequakes, calving events, and any other detectable near-surface seismic phenomena."

Current approaches to treat bone defects include autografts and allografts that are associated with limitations such as shortage of donors and risk of disease transmission. Strategies built on tissue engineering offer alternative approaches to repair and regenerate tissues. The transfer of tissue engineering methodology from the lab to the clinic is limited by the failure to adequately vascularize scaffolds following implantation. The goal of this project is to promote the neogenesis of bone and supporting vasculature in a synchronized manner similar to the physiological process of bone growth during maturation. The project is transformative in nature in that contrary to conventional methods, instead of trying to counteract inflammation, the proposed approach establishes the proof of principle for the use of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, to regulate immune cell behavior and use their secreted signaling molecules to drive vasculogenesis and bone formation. The approach involves the use of (i) a resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found commonly in grapes and berries, (ii) a biomimetic scaffold with native bone extracellular matrix protein components, and (iii) mesenchymal stem cells. Rapid perfusion throughout an implanted scaffold is a critical issue for engineering the repair of a wide variety of tissues in addition to bone. The study delineate the potential of resveratrol as a potent physiological cue to control inflammatory response with many applications beyond the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (e.g. tumor inflammation).

The use of optical microscopy has greatly progressed over the last decade. Many optical microscopic methods have been used in materials and biological imaging as well as chemical sensing. While these techniques hold great promise in sensitivity, some do require high and potentially damaging light intensities in illumination. What is now needed, is a chemical imaging technique which takes advantage of the highly focused behavior of the two photon process, but at the same time it keeps the peak intensity at low levels. The imaging technique under development by Professor Goodson uses a beam of light where the quantum states of photon pairs are linked, i.e. entangled photons. Utilizing the property of quantum entanglement, Professor Goodson and his group probe and image molecules with extremely high resolution and with a very small number of photons.  The developed technique subsequently enables them to study interesting biological systems such as tissue imaging and the formation of amyloids with Alzheimer's patients.  This support from the National Science Foundation also helps to train and mentor a diverse group of scientists (graduate students and postdoctoral students) in areas such as chemistry, physics and materials science.<br/><br/>With this grant, Professor Goodson at the University of Michigan and his research group are investigating a new approach to chemical sensitivity through entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) microscopy.

Solar cells for producing electricity require materials that absorb the sun's energy and convert its photons to electrons, a process called photovoltaics.  Lowering the cost per watt for solar photovoltaic energy conversion systems is a long-standing goal that could enable more widespread adoption of solar energy.  In particular, thin-film solar cells can be made cheaper than crystalline silicon-based solar cells if the right combination of material properties for high solar energy conversion efficiency can be found.  The goal of this project is to investigate new layered structures for thin-film solar photovoltaics that potentially offer both low-cost processing and high solar energy conversion efficiency.  These new layered structures, based on a metal-insulator-semiconductor sandwich of electronic materials, have behavior at their respective material boundaries that may favorably change the overall electronic structure and properties of the solar cell, resulting in improved performance. The innovative aspect of this research is that advanced techniques will be used to deposit these layers on top of one another with atomic level precision so that these properties can be more carefully and insightfully studied.  The educational activities associated with this project include the development of a community outreach program with a local science center and the production of videos that animate the effects of physics behind the operation of photovoltaic devices.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to identify the underlying mechanisms that induce barrier height modifications and other interfacial electronic changes by insertion of dielectric tunnel layers in the context of metal-insulator-semiconductor photovoltaics (PV). Metal-insulator-semiconductor structures will be fabricated by film deposition and interface modification techniques that allow for an unprecedented level of interfacial control. This level of control will enable investigation of the fundamental behavior of fixed charges, molecular surface functionalization, atomic layer deposition (ALD) chemistry, hydrogen treatment, and ALD bilayers in MIS structures. The specific influence of these phenomena on barrier heights and interfacial electronic figures of merit relevant for improving PV devices will be quantified.  Dipoles within bilayers of dissimilar metal oxides will also be used to control barrier heights.  The impact of fixed charge on electronic properties will be investigated by varying fixed charge density and insulator thickness experimentally, and comparing these experimental results with theoretical simulations.  Molecular surface functionalization and hydrogen at interfaces provide additional synthetic control, and their ability to minimize interfacial electronic defects will be determined. By comparing electronic measurements, low-energy ion scattering, and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, critical relationships between layer mixing, dipole strength, and interface trap densities will be elucidated.

For industrial applications, these synthesis methods must also be scalable and reproducible.  Microwave (MW) chemistry methods may achieve these performance demands.  Dr. Geoffrey Strouse is investigating microwave chemistry to develop new methods for the synthesis of magnetic alloys with very small dimensions (nanoparticles).  He is particularly interested in determining the effects of MW frequency, power, and optical properties on the rate of thermal decomposition of molecular clusters based upon the Prussian blue molecule.  Prussian blue molecules have are two different transition metals which, when decomposed by MW heating to form a metal alloy, create a nanoparticle with extremely strong magnetic properties.  These magnetic properties may be useful in many technological applications.  By judiciously choosing the MW variables, Dr. Strouse is able to control the composition and size of the nanoscale magnet, carefully tailoring its magnetic properties to the task at hand.  The research uncovers knowledge that is broadly useful in bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis and establishes new synthetic routes for nano-metal systems that are sustainable and can be scaled to industrial applications.  The MW methodology developed in this research impacts not only the fields of magnetism and magnet technology, but may offer routes to new catalysts as well.

By careful selection of microwave power, frequency, and molecular design, Dr. Strouse is able to control the rate of the reaction by selectively coupling to electric and magnetic dipoles in the precursor.  In conjunction with computational studies, dielectric spectroscopy and magnetic measurements, instrumental design, and materials characterization of the nanosized bi-metallic alloys are used to fabricate a series of advanced magnetic materials and to investigate MW-induced reaction mechanisms.  The research has significant broader impact on industrial magnetic and catalytic applications, since the methodology is scalable and may be translated to new materials and larger quantity applications.  Dr. Strouse involves young students, science teachers, undergraduate and graduate students in his research, and serves as a mentor of students underrepresented in STEM fields.  He is actively engaged in outreach to high school and middle school students, and provides learning experiences for these students with hands-on science activities. He actively maintains a website for dissemination of data, experimental methodology, and detailed MW analysis, accessible to the general public through Florid State University web pages."

Additionally, the scholarship recipients will be exposed to career exploration opportunities in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics through connections to local STEM employers, formalized career preparation opportunities, and job placement services.  A key feature of the project will be the scholars' participation in a STEM leadership program that promotes the development of interpersonal communication, problem solving, collaborative work, foresight and planning, and moral consciousness skills.<br/><br/>Research suggests that norms in higher educational settings typically emphasize independence and may be alienating to students who come from groups that emphasize interdependence.  This project will investigate the role that the development of interdependent skills in the context of STEM has in promoting academic success generally, and success in STEM specifically among academically talented, low-income students.  Interdependent skills will be nurtured through participation in the STEM leadership program and be reinforced through cohort meetings and individual mentoring.  The PI team hypothesizes that making these interdependent skills a central part of professional development in STEM may foster the persistence and success of all students; particularly those eligible for S-STEM scholarships.  Formative and summative evaluation will include collecting data related retention and graduation rates and surveys on the effectiveness of the graduate school and career preparation activities.  Results from the project will be disseminated via education journals such as the Journal of Higher Education, Journal of College Science Teaching, and Journal of Research in Science Teaching and at conferences specific to each STEM major like the American Association of Physics Teachers meetings, Biennial Conference of Chemical Educators, among others."

When a new species invades a habitat, how can we predict whether it will coexist with the native species, drive one or more of them extinct, or be driven to extinction itself by the natives? This research will investigate whether coexistence is an evolved property of species interactions. This will happen if species that could not coexist on first contact can act as agents of natural selection on each other's features in a way that enables them to evolve rapidly to coexist.  Understanding when and how this evolution occurs can have a profound effect on our ability to predict the results of invasions, species re-stocking, and habitat alteration on biodiversity. This research will engage undergraduate researchers, as well as engaging the public with an outreach website.<br/><br/>This research focuses on one of the most challenging of species interactions, which occurs when the adults of two species compete with each other for food but each preys on juveniles of the other.  This research will examine how Hart's killifish and Trinidadian guppies, which interact in this manner, somehow coexist in higher elevation streams in Trinidad.  Typically, guppies encounter killifish when guppies invade locations that have held only killifish.  This research exploits the fact that comparisons can be made among killifish populations that coexist with guppies and populations that have never encountered guppies, along with comparisons between guppy populations that have not invaded killifish-only locations, populations that have been introduced into those locations in recent experiments, and populations that have coexisted with killifish for decades.  The work includes experiments in artificial streams that mix and match these populations to examine how fitness of each species depends on the combinations of its own genetic background and that of the other species.  It also includes experiments in natural pools that remove one species to measure its net effect on the other.  The researchers will also be documenting the fates of guppies and killifish in experimental introductions to assess how much evolution is actually occurring.  There will also be laboratory experiments that pair individuals of different body sizes within and among species to understand how competition and predation depend on relative body sizes of interacting individuals.  Finally, the research will synthesize these results with computational models that describe the ecological and evolutionary trajectories, which can be used as tools for understanding the fate of biodiversity in a variety of contexts."

In this graduate student project, research will address the impacts of darkening water in Midwestern lakes on the prevalence of disease in a common miniature crustacean. Lake darkening occurs due to increases in input of plant debris washing into lakes as a result of increased precipitation and storm severity. Lake nutrient levels and the penetration of various wavelengths of light into the water are both affected by the darkening process. The common miniature crustacean known as Daphnia can be parasitized by certain fungi and/or bacteria.  This project will examine the mechanisms by which lake darkening can affect these parasitic interactions.  It will provide insight into how altering environmental factors can influence disease in lake communities, and will also involve local students in research and fieldwork in south-central Indiana.<br/><br/>In order to quantify how lake darkening affects disease dynamics in lakes, for this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement grant, the graduate student will manipulate the darkness of lake enclosures through two treatments: shading and addition of dissolved organic matter. The student will then seed enclosures with local community members (Daphnia hosts, other plankton, and invertebrate predators) and parasite-infected hosts. Abiotic habitat variables (e.g. temperature, pH, oxygen levels), community structure, and disease levels will be measured throughout the course of the ten-week experiment and compared to control enclosures without shading or added dissolved organic matter. Since lake darkening is expected to affect all lake community members either directly or indirectly, it is important to observe and quantify effects of these environmental factors on hosts, disease agents, predators, producers, decomposers, and physical habitat structure. By measuring differences in communities in the different treatments, we will be able to tease apart the mechanisms by which lake darkening affects disease."

This enables serial connections of gates, generating signaling cascades that can be assembled into complex molecular circuits based on nucleic acid hybridization where both the encoded program and the machinery that runs the program are composed of DNA. The use of synthetic DNA as a material for biocomputing in human cells has several advantages: DNA circuits rely on fully programmable Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions and thus can be rationally designed at the molecular level, delivering a high degree of control. New components, such as gates, amplifiers, and sub-networks can be readily encoded in DNA sequences, which provides modularity and adaptability. <br/>        <br/>The completion of the research objectives will lead to broadly applicable approaches to programmable biological computation devices that are functional in human cells. The developed methodologies will be of interest to scientists who are developing or applying DNA-programmable algorithms or assemblies to biological systems; furthermore, they will facilitate interactions with the field of microRNA biology. The outputs of the DNA computation process can be readily interfaced with cellular and organismal systems, thus extending the impact of this methodology into broader applications. In addition, the proposed biocomputing circuitry is inexpensive to manufacture and easy to assemble - in contrast to traditional techniques for the analysis of microRNA patterns. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this project will train the next generation of students in the programming in oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide chemistry, and cell biology. Based on developed expertise, outreach activities with museums and schools will be conducted in order to excite children at a young age (and their parents) about STEM, specifically at the interface of computer science, biology, and chemistry.<br/><br/>This research will test if cellular microRNA pattern detection, analysis, and response functions of devices can be combined in DNA-based computation circuitry. This will represent an innovative approach to the analysis of microRNA patterns directly inside of live cells. Output signals of DNA-based circuits are not restricted to electrical or optical outputs (as in case of traditional detection and analysis methods), but can be designed as oligonucleotides, fluorophores, dyes, and other molecules. An innovative DNA-analog based biocomputing system will be developed in order to protect the encoded oligonucleotide programs from biological environments and highly specific self-assembly capabilities will provide flexible designs for next-generation molecular computation devices in living systems. The following research objectives will be pursued: (1) demonstrate DNA computing of increasing complexity in live cells, (2) interface cellular DNA computing with signal amplification, (3) engineer cellular DNA computing to provide molecular outputs, and (4) use new materials to encode oligonucleotide programs in order to protect the DNA devices from cellular environments."

Glaciers include Thwaites Glacier, which has become a focal point in the discussion of West Antarctic retreat, Whillans Ice Stream as an example of the archetype ice stream, and Byrd Glacier, a major outlet glacier draining East Antarctica through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Ice Shelf.  This study will investigate whether the ongoing changes in these glaciers will lead to long-term mass loss (the onset of ice sheet collapse), or whether these glaciers will quickly stabilize with a new geometry.   <br/><br/>To adequately incorporate the dynamic behavior of outlet glaciers and ice streams requires inclusion of the relevant physical processes, and the development of regional models that employ a numerical grid with a horizontal grid spacing sufficiently refined to capture smaller-scale bed topographic features that may control the flow of these glaciers.

In particular, an attempt will be made to resolve the question whether observed rapid changes are the result of perturbations at the terminus or grounding line, or whether these changes reflect ice-dynamical forcing over the grounded reaches. High-resolution satellite imagery will be used to investigate ice-flow perturbations on smaller spatial scales than has been done before, to evaluate the importance of localized sites of high basal resistance on grounding-line stability.

Previous research in this highly topical field has demonstrated the importance of neurochemicals, toxins and field potentials for neuronal communication in healthy and diseased states. The dynamics of interaction between these key functions, in all areas of the brain, is clearly of critical clinical importance to the development of a useful brain chemical model. The proposed research will result in the development of a novel multi-purpose biosensing nanoprobe capable of near simultaneous in vivo sensing of multiple brain analytes in body fluids. The proposed probe will utilize new carbon nanostructures, advanced nanoelectrode geometries and fabrication processes and redox cycling methods to demonstrate at least a 10-fold increase in the key sensor metrics, i.e. the sensitivity, selectivity and limits of detection as compared to current neural sensing electrodes. Specifically, and for the first time, a concentric three-dimensional nanoprobe for brain analyte testing will be microfabricated with several individually addressable BDUNCD (Boron-Doped Ultrananocrystalline Diamond) and Pt nanoring nanoelectrodes ?nanodes?. One of the potential applications of the nanodes is the localized sensing of changes in the levels of different brain analytes, e.g. dopamine, lead and electrical field potentials as affected by external stimuli such as neuromodulation. This will fundamentally improve understanding of neurostimulation mechanisms, which is a promising technique now being employed for patients with brain disorders. The creation of new nanodes, the central goal of this project, would also allow progress in emerging analytical measurements within cellular and sub-cellular domains. This project will deliver innovative nanoprobes to advance basic science that is expected to be transformative in terms of its unique multifunctional, multimodal and multiplexing capability.

Tropical societies and ecosystems rely heavily on monsoon rainfall, and thus understanding the origin and nature of decadal-scale hydroclimate variability is critical to understanding the dynamics at play in such systems.<br/><br/>Recent field studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggests that over the last millennium, the TRB may have contracted during the Little Ice Age (LIA)  thereby producing reduced monsoon rainfall along both the northern and southern margins of the TRB.  In contrast, paleohydrologic and modeling studies show that the global TRB shifted southward meridionally at this time, creating anti-phasing (dry/wet) of rainfall between the TRB northern and southern margins. <br/><br/>The researchers have developed a sub-decadal resolved (~4 year) late Holocene (the last 3,000 years) IASM reconstruction from cave KNI-51 that, when integrated with paleomonsoon records from Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent, reveal not only TRB contraction during the LIA, but expansion and contraction at multi-decadal to centennial time scales over the entirety of the late Holocene. <br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are to extend the KNI-51 stalagmite record through the middle and early Holocene (9,000-3,000 years ago) to examine the nature of TRB dynamics during conditions distinct from those of the late Holocene, including elevated contrasts between summer insolation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, lower eustatic sea level (and increased exposure of Indo-Pacific continental shelf), intervals of reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime. <br/><br/>To better understand atmospheric circulation associated with TRB dynamics, these proxy data will be integrated with climate dynamical analyses of the 6,000 year time slice simulations conducted within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5/Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) framework and with the newly available Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) simulations conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>The project involves the potential for a unique view of TRB variability over the last 9,000 years and provides an important test of the skill of CMIP5-class models to accurately reproduce associated Indo-Pacific atmospheric dynamics.  As the TRB is closely tied to tropical methane production, this research will help refine estimates of regional tropical methane fluxes during the Holocene. The research will be conducted with extensive involvement of undergraduate students thereby providing experience in advanced paleoclimate research and data analysis techniques."

A key challenge associated with the analysis of such big data is how to measure and infer complex dependence structure, which is a fundamental step in statistics and becomes more difficult owing to the data's high dimensionality and huge size. The main goal of this research project is to develop new dependence measures for quantifying dependence of large scale data sets such as temporally dependent functional data and high dimensional data, and utilize these new measures to develop novel statistical tools for conducting sparse principal component analysis, dimensional reduction, and simultaneous hypothesis testing. Building on the new dependence metrics that can capture nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence, the methodologies under development are expected to lead to more accurate prediction and inference, as well as more effective dimension reduction in the analysis of functional and high dimensional data. <br/><br/>The research consists of three projects addressing different challenges in the analysis of functional and high dimensional data. In Project 1, the investigators introduce a new operator-valued quantity to characterize the conditional mean (in)dependence of one function-valued random element given another, and apply the newly developed dependent metrics to do dimension reduction for functional time series under a new framework of finite dimensional functional data. In Project 2, the investigators explore a new dimension reduction framework for regression models with high dimensional response, which requires less stringent linear model assumptions and is more flexible in terms of capturing possible nonlinear dependence between the response and the covariates. In Project 3, the investigators develop new tests for the mutual independence of high dimensional data via distance covariance and rank distance covariance using both sum of squares and maximum type test statistics. Overall, the three lines of research are all related to big data, and they touch upon various aspects of modern statistics; the project aims to push the current frontiers in areas including sparse principal component analysis, inference for dependent functional data, and high dimensional multivariate analysis to another level."

One arm of the rift extends from Lake Superior to Oklahoma and the other through central Michigan to perhaps as far south as Alabama. Where exposed in the Lake Superior (or Keweenaw) region, surface observations and geophysical data indicate that the rift basin is filled with flood basalts, which are unusual landforms whose formation can have a devastating influence on climate and life. Most flood basalts around the world occur in so-called Large Igneous Provinces in which rapid eruption of a large volume of basaltic magma, created by deeper mantle processes (mantle plumes), flows great distances over existing topography to form a thick stack of lava flows. However, flood basalts of the Mid-Continent Rift depart significantly from this norm, occupying a relatively small space and erupted significant volumes for about 20 million years. These characteristics are difficult to explain solely through the traditional mechanisms proposed for the generation of flood basalts. This project explores the idea that the Mid-Continent Rift formed as a combination of rifting and interaction with deeper a mantle plume thus having characteristics of both a rift and a Large Igneous Province. Besides forming a fundamental structure of the North American continent, the Mid-continent Rift hosts important copper ore deposits in the Lake Superior region. The project would advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved STEM education and educator development through development of teaching modules and workshops for formal and informal educators; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through continuation of ongoing place-based outreach in national and state parks; and (3) development of a competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate students and by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In contrast to typical rifts that are filled with a mixture of clastic sediments, volcanoclastics, and lava flows, the 3000-km Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift is filled with flood basalt with thicknesses that exceed even most large igneous provinces. These observations can be resolved by considering the Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift as a hybrid rift and mantle plume-generated large igneous province. In this model, the volcanics were deposited during an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a post-rift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding sag basin without associated faulting. This project addresses the question of how the rift and plume interacted, including the possibility of lengthy interaction between an initially distant plume via material flow at the base of the lithosphere. Specifically, the project will use major and trace element analysis, isotopic characterization (Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf), and argon geochronology of rift basalts to determine: (1) the geochemical signatures of the source reservoirs contributing to the basalts and their change over time; and (2) the temperatures, pressures, and source composition(s) of melt generation. The project employs a 2D parallel primitive variable particle-in-cell finite-difference method to study the behavior and melt formation of rifting under Precambrian mantle conditions in the absence or presence of a plume and geodynamic modeling to constrain the extent of lateral migration of plume material under Precambrian mantle conditions coupled with a model for melting and melt extraction. Rifting history is determined from the cusp in the apparent polar wander path and microplate kinematics from gravity modeling."

In addition to advancing the vital (bio) chemical sensing field, the project will benefit society by educating students in a diverse and highly interdisciplinary environment, producing highly qualified scientists/engineers who will contribute to this important multifaceted field, addressing key challenges in materials and device designs. The success of the project is expected to significantly advance the fields of thin film flexible electronics in conjunction with life-saving analytical applications.<br/>Technical:<br/>The specific goal of the proposed research is to advance the development of compact, sensitive, reliable, eventually user-friendly, inexpensive, flexible, and field-deployable, integrated photoluminescence (PL)-based chem/bio sensors, including in multiple analyte arrays. This objective addresses the growing need for continued miniaturization of sensors in applications such as medical testing, water and food quality monitoring, and security inspection. Moreover, such small-size sensors will enable their integration into existing and developing technologies, e.g., wearable electronics. To accomplish the objective of the proposed research fundamental science and engineering research is required. Thin film¡Vbased microcavity organic light emitting diodes (mcOLEDs) will be used as optical excitation sources; they will be integrated with hybrid, perovskite-based photodetectors (PDs). The mcOLEDs will be fabricated combinatorially on a single substrate, providing narrow emission bands (full width half max FWHM~20 nm). The emission peaks, produced by different active materials and microcavity dimensions, will range from the red to the near UV. The uniform dense array of such mcOLEDs, yet unachieved, will be integrated with two types of highly responsive perovskite PDs (an approach not yet explored): those responsive over a broad spectral range and those responsive over a narrow range. Bio/chem analytes will be monitored in two modes of operation, measuring analyte-induced changes in the (i) PL intensity using narrow-band PDs and (ii) PL decay time using both PD types. Developing both approaches will enhance selectivity and specificity. Importantly, to enable the advantageous PL monitoring where viable, the mcOLEDs and PDs will be evaluated and optimized to shorten the pulsed electroluminescence (EL) decay time and the PDs¡¦ response time by fundamental studies of their relation to materials, charge mobility, layer structures and thickness, defects, and device design. The integrated compact sensors will be demonstrated for two array types: (i) those operated by monitoring PL for, e.g., O2, dissolved O2, glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and ethanol, and (2) those operated largely by monitoring IPL as in e.g., pH measurement and immunoassays, which are of biological and health monitoring importance. The approaches outlined in this proposal will pave the way to miniaturized analytical tools on flexible substrates, integrated with microfluidic architectures. Array designs, attribute optimization, the demonstrated applications, and initial exploration of flexible devices are expected to significantly advance the fields of organic and hybrid electronics and analytical methodologies."

In a world where over half of the world's population now lives in cities, finding this balance is crucial because poor urban planning and management may have costly consequences in economic growth, public health, general well-being, and environmental quality. In recent years, a number of American cities have exhibited the effects of infrastructural failures: flagging economic investment, social unrest, and disease outbreaks. But while the effects are clear, the solutions are not. In the research supported by this award, anthropologists Dr. Joshua B. Fisher (High Point University) and Dr. Alex Nading (University of Edinburgh) will address the problem through innovative research in an urban context whose history of experimentation with policy alternatives and relatively small size, will be particularly revealing of what works, what does not, for whom, and why. <br/><br/>The researchers will travel to Ciudad Sandino, a section of peri-urban Managua, Nicaragua.  Recently, in response to increased income inequality, urban environmental degradation, and declining revenues from tourism and foreign investment, the city has undertaken a new, cross-sector, integrated urban development campaign, ""Live Clean, Live Healthy, Live Beautiful, Live Well."" The researchers will examine the complex impacts of this program upon matters of waste management, environmental education, food safety, and public health. They will collect data with a suite of ethnographic research methods including ethnographic interviews, participant observation, photo documentation, and archival analysis. In addition to these more traditional research methods, the researchers will also collect data interactively and dynamically by creating and following a longitudinal ethnographic cohort. Through a series of workshops over three years, a diverse array of citizens including policy-makers, teachers, and informal economy food producers and garbage pickers will be asked to provide feedback to each other and to the researchers on how the programs are affecting them and their worlds. Findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that shape the development of effective urban social policy and successful cities, given their many entangled social, economic, and environmental dimensions."

The goal of this research is to understand and resolve the limitations that restrict the applicability and effectiveness of program profiling. The intellectual merits are to develop a complete understanding of the fundamental characteristics of program profiling, its limitations and its impact on the effectiveness of dependent optimizations, build a comprehensive and structured profiling framework to increase the efficiency and ease the adoption of profiling mechanisms during VM tasks, and set the stage for increased employment and realized benefits from adaptive optimizations in a VM.

To conduct this fundamental study, assess and demonstrate its observations, and show the benefits of more effective program profiling to improve existing VM optimizations, and to enable the creation of new adaptive VM optimizations, this work will employ three sets of real VM adaptive tasks: (a) selective compilation and feedback-directed optimizations to improve program speed, (b) heap memory management to increase performance and power efficiency, and (c) code cache management to maintain performance at lower memory utilization. This research promises to improve the performance and accessibility of managed language programs, which is very important for future computing systems as they provide an ideal programming platform in the face of growing software complexity, the best distribution format for portable Internet-based applications, and the most effective execution strategy for safe and secure execution of untrusted web services."

A long-standing view holds that plants regulate microbial community assemblages in the rhizosphere, i.e., the area of soil that is influenced by plant root secretions and soil micro-organisms. However, how plants select for, or enrich, specific microbial populations and the corresponding functional traits that enhance plant fitness are poorly understood areas. The fellowship research investigates the potential direct (chemical signaling) and indirect (nutrient-mediated) effects of plant root exudates on the phenotypic characteristics of microbes that inhibit plant pathogens, and the likely implications for plant-microbe ecological interactions and coevolutionary dynamics.<br/><br/>The fellowship provides training in plant and soil microbiology (particularly the use of molecular biochemical tools), genomic sequencing, omics and data mining.

These DEM's have horizontal and vertical offsets of up to several meters that can be reduced to the DEM relative accuracy of 0.2 meter with a single ground control point. We will use available control points from ground and lidar surveys to register individual DEMs and optimized, least-squares co-registration to provide control between overlapping DEM's over large regions.

In particular, benefiting from the electronics industry's development, DNA sequencing technology has reduced the cost per genome to about $1000 at a rapid rate and improved accuracy. This project investigates the downward scalability of semiconductor sequencing technology towards single-molecule of DNA.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to investigate the scalability of field effect semiconductor DNA sequencing method to a resolution of single molecule.  The key idea is to utilize serpentine nanowire (sNW) quantum effect device (QED) as a sensor for localized detection of intrinsic charge of DNA phosphate backbone during a modified Sanger sequencing process of a single DNA molecule. The sensor device is a molecular scale Si nanowire with diameter less than 10 nm defined by e-beam lithography. At this length scale, strong quantum confinement induces quantization of sub-bands and higher carrier mobility. Together with Coulomb blockade effects, the sensitivity to its surface charge can be significantly enhanced to enable single-molecule DNA sequencing. Techniques of surface hydrolysis, molecular layer deposition of linker molecule, as well as the use of HfO2 as gate dielectrics are proposed to improve surface stability and therefore signal to noise ratio of DNA sequencing. The novel serpentine NW morphology would enable fast kinetics during the DNA binding to the sensor surfaces and considerably reduce surface binding competition between nanowire and its surrounding area, without the use of difficult selective chemistry. Chips are designed to fit commercial next generation sequencing systems to take advantages of fluidic management and data acquisition capability.  The successful scaling of semiconductor field effect sequencing technology to the single molecular level would have high impacts to the field of DNA sequencing.  At large, this technology may ultimately allow downward scalability of sequencing time to a few hours and cost to below $100/genome. The research findings would likely contribute new knowledge to the fields of nanoelectronics, biosensing, DNA sequencing, and quantum mechanics, etc. The program will utilize existing programs, such as NSF REU and ""e-Biosensor Discovery"" to generate significant educational impact, including integration of research and education, promoting diversity, and outreach to K-12, the underrepresented women and Hispanic student body at University of Texas at Dallas, and local community colleges as well as the workforce in the Dallas and Fort/Worth area."

That process remains manual and error-prone, while new research advances tend to be partial and disconnected from one another. A key reason is that prevailing approaches treat uniformly software systems across application domains (e.g., games, banking, avionics).  The variations among different kinds of software systems have led some researchers to narrow their focus to specific domains.  Domain-specific approaches work well, but only within the confines of a domain.  This project is developing simple, but powerful techniques that enable software engineers to extend the benefits of domain-specificity across diverse domains, and that guide and support engineers in modeling and analyzing complex problems.<br/><br/>The project furthers the advances to-date in model-driven engineering (MDE). MDE has two known shortcomings: (1) existing techniques generate software modeling support for an application domain, but not analysis and simulation tools; (2) implementation generation is restricted to specific domains, languages, and toolsets.  This is coupled with two additional shortcomings: (3) modeling editors generated by MDE toolsets provide no support for design space exploration; (4) optimal system deployment depends on parameters that form a massive space of options.  This project targets the above four shortcomings. It defines an MDE platform with extensible semantics and automatically synthesizes model interpreters for software system design, analysis, simulation, and generation.  The biggest envisioned impact of this project is in its potential to change how software engineers approach development.  In particular, the burden of making a possibly overwhelming number of non-critical, but also non-obvious, decisions is shifted to tools, allowing engineers to focus on things that matter.  This presents an opportunity to change the way software engineers are trained, from the predominant one-size-fits-all curricula of today to the more appropriate domain-driven specializations."

Despite its intuitive manifestations, the scientific understanding of turbulence is far from satisfactory. A related phenomenon is ""wave turbulence,"" which pertains to similar problems but for different physical systems involving wave interactions (e.g.,ocean or plasma waves). The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of certain phenomena pertaining to wave turbulence from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint and thereby to take the first steps towards putting the theory on solid mathematical foundations.<br/><br/>The project addresses two different regimes of long-time behavior for nonlinear dispersive and wave partial differential equations. The first regime can be characterized by ""out-of-equilibrium dynamics,"" in which solutions do not exhibit long-time stability around equilibrium configurations. This is the typical behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations posed on compact domains, where dispersive effects do not translate to decay, and is the natural setting of wave turbulence theory. The other regime of long-time behavior concerns dispersive partial differential equations posed on Euclidean space, for which one can hope to have stable equilibrium points for the dynamics (stationary solutions). The ""asymptotic stability"" of trivial equilibria (zero solutions) is mostly well understood by now, but that of nontrivial stationary solutions is far from settled. The project suggests several avenues of research to improve our understanding in the two aforementioned directions."

This project aims to discover the particular lipid requirements for chloroplast biogenesis and function.  The project will use the full range of biochemical, molecular and genetic techniques to investigate mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis, in which different changes in membrane lipid composition are associated with dramatic phenotypes. The knowledge gained will help scientists predict the likely consequences of environmental changes on plant growth and crop productivity.  Eventually it will be possible to manipulate membrane lipid composition of plants to better suit particular environmental conditions.  Because photosynthesis is central to plant productivity, the extensive temperature-dependent effects observed in the mutants have wide implications for understanding the temperature responses of plants, and agricultural production systems.  The project will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to receive training and experience in plant biology research relevant to agriculture, forestry and other fields of plant production.  In particular, the project participants will contribute to an outreach program that uses experiential learning and peer mentoring to encourage Native American high school students to enroll in STEM disciplines in college.<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on two new classes of mutants with distinct phenotypes. In the fab1 mutant, an increase in 16:0 results in the collapse of photosynthesis after 2-3 weeks at 2°C, and to destruction of chloroplasts. A collection of suppressor mutations that allow survival of fab1 at 2°C have been isolated. Cloning and characterization of these will provide information about the photosynthetic processes that are most susceptible to the membrane alterations in fab1 plants. The project has generated an allelic series of fad2 fad6 mutants containing 5% to 46% polyunsaturated fatty acids (vs. 77% in wild type) that provide the first opportunity to explore, in detail, the relationship between thylakoid unsaturation and chloroplast function. Analyses indicate that an increase in leakage of protons through the thylakoid membrane is one possible defect in the mutants. The project has also discovered alterations in the capacities of different pathways of thylakoid protein transport in other mutants and these investigations will be extended to include the fad2 fad6 mutants. The results obtained will permit the development and testing of mechanistic models that relate the physiological phenotypes of the mutants to the biophysics of membrane lipid structure. The complementary paths of investigation described in this proposal promise important advances in the application of biophysical principles to understanding how lipid molecules contribute to the functioning of chloroplasts and the responses of plants to environmental change."

While learning progressions have shown promise as supports for teachers as they design formative assessments, as well as suggested new approaches for modeling student learning, the field is still only at the beginning stages of understanding how learning progressions can inform and enhance student learning. This research is needed because studies show that although formative assessment may support student learning, formative assessment practices are not easy for teachers to learn. Through this effort up to 72 high school biology, chemistry and physics teachers will participate in professional learning communities to help them become more effective in using learning progression-centered formative assessment in their classrooms. This project will build on prior studies by helping teachers in setting learning goals, measuring student progress toward those goals, and providing feedback to improve students' performance. It will also extend an ongoing research-practice partnership between a university-based educational research team and a school district that are both committed to improving science education for its population of socioeconomically, linguistically, and ethnically diverse students.<br/><br/>The overarching goals will be to investigate how teachers: (1) Engage with different types of learning progressions in different content domains to inform formative assessment design in professional learning communities; (2) Enact learning progression-based formative assessment tasks with students; (3) Measure the effect of learning progression-centered professional development on student learning, as well as the mediators of this effect; and will also (4) Model student learning and the extent to which assessment results support the hypotheses represented in learning progressions. The study will employ complementary qualitative and quantitative methods and follow a year of design-based implementation research with a quasi-experimental study of teachers participating in research-team facilitated professional learning communities focused on learning progressions. Evidence pertaining to teacher professional learning will be gathered through the triangulation of data from front-to-back analyses of teacher participation in professional learning communities, structured interviews, classroom observations, and analysis of formative assessment tasks. Student learning will be tracked through pre-post diagnostic assessments linked to learning progressions teachers use in their professional learning communities. Results from this work will advance knowledge about theory building through tools and resources along with evidence of their effectiveness, design criteria to guide formation of effective teacher collaboration around formative assessment design in professional learning communities, and model approaches for student performance relative to learning progressions. These end products will also provide instruments to help schools and districts collect evidence in real-time of professional learning community function and formative assessment task quality."

While many researchers are studying the impact and functioning of shale oil and gas markets, the proposed research aims at studying a new and important aspect regarding the leases on private as well as publicly-owned land which exploration firms acquire for their shale gas extraction activity. Given that the regulatory infrastructure in many states is not well developed for this new industry, individually negotiated lease agreements become de facto regulatory tool in this industry, but little is known about how they perform in terms of standard economic criteria. By analyzing the interplay between private negotiations of lease clauses, government regulation, and market power, the proposed research will inform ongoing legislative debates about the best way to regulate drilling activity. Moreover, it will contribute to a more general economic discussion about the value of individual negotiations versus top-down regulation in mitigating potential negative externalities of business activity. <br/><br/>The investigators will use novel datasets to analyze questions central to the increased interaction between residential populations and oil and gas extraction activity due to recently developed horizontal drilling techniques. Three of the proposed projects will provide an integrated picture of the development of various activities surrounding affected properties. These projects are focused on measuring the value landowners and exploration companies place on various lease clauses, their respective abilities to bargain for such clauses when negotiating leases, the roles that regulation and competition for access to minerals play in such negotiations, and the impact of leasing and drilling on housing markets. The fourth and final project will focus on the interplay between firm competition and regulation in oil and gas lease auctions held by the federal and state governments. It will make use of competitive auction data to infer the implied costs of recent, and hotly-debated, changes in the regulation of drilling and exploratory activity. The project will also provide a guide to governments holding such auctions about better ways to design these sales."

In complex systems where rules of randomness are well understood and sufficiently many underlying events are independent of each other, aggregate behavior at large scales tends to deviate very little from the median behavior. This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, has been the subject of exciting developments, since concentration tools allow one to analyze many essential properties of rather general systems. Being strongly motivated by challenging purely mathematical questions, this research area also has a wide range of applications in disciplines such as information theory, statistics, computer science, and machine learning, among others. This research project is aimed in particular at a correct understanding of the role of the growing dimension, especially in the problems where high dimension serves as a unifying force. High-dimensional models are useful in practice for instance to understand the entire evolution of a phenomenon in time, not just the governing local rules, which may lead one's low-dimensional intuition astray. The project will have an important impact correcting such misconceptions in mathematics, and will have further impact when these ideas are applied to areas such as statistics and machine learning. The project will also have broader impact on educating undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/>The project's themes refer either to long-standing open problems or to challenging questions related to recent developments. More specifically, the investigator plans to develop new concentration tools starting from the spherical concentration phenomenon and its extensions to Grassman and Stiefel manifolds. With new tools, one of the targets of investigation will be the circle of problems related to the K-L-S conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz, and Simonovits. The project will explore refined concentration properties of high dimensional projections of log-concave and more general convex measures; in particular, the work will investigate new integral geometric characteristics of convex measures on Euclidean spaces that are responsible for spectral gap and Cheeger isoperimetric constants. Part of the project is devoted to asymptotic expansions in the central limit theorem for the relative entropy and Fisher information, including Berry-Esseen bounds, and their applications to optimal transport for sums of independent random vectors. The project also deals with information-theoretic inequalities and transport problems about empirical distributions."

Rapid screening (less than 2 hours) for the presence or absence of yeasts, molds, gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria and other phylogenetic microbial classes regardless of the strain or species will be developed. Current rapid methods rely on incubation followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification. The proposed homogeneous phylogenetic-plasmonic assays are based on the combination of plasmonic and colorimetry mechanisms (generation of color by the aggregation of metal nanoparticles), and the identification and targeting of specific phylogenetic entities on the microbial surface, which are specific to a certain class of microorganisms, and can be activated to interact with plasmonic nanoparticles. Such an interaction results in a rapid formation of a nanoparticle monolayer surrounding the microorganism, leading to rapid color change of the sample from red to dark-blue, visible to the naked eye. As a result, the proposed assay technology is expected to reduce cost and time needed for analysis and decision making would become feasible in less than two hours. Beyond the applied aspects of the project, the proposed research will explore microbial surface entities, particularly disulfide bridge-containing proteins, and shed light on their importance, distribution and role in molecular recognition reactions and stability of microbial cells. The main direct impact of this research is to enhance the capabilities of food and environmental diagnostic laboratories by enabling rapid microbial screening in food plants and environmental sites, allowing timely implementation of a preventive or curative response. The project proposes to build collaboration with industrial partners, which will help fill the gap between academic research and the development of commercial products that benefit society. The proposed research program will introduce graduate, undergraduate students, and post-docs to transdisciplinary research and educate them on how to solve problems by applying different fields of science and engineering, such as nanotechnology, chemistry, biotechnology and food engineering. The results of this research will be broadly disseminated through conferences, peer-reviewed publications, potential patents and news articles to inform the general public."

Various models for deposit formation relate the gold mineralization to different geologic events which likely occurred at different times, including magmatic activity, or circulation of groundwater-derived fluids through deeper gold-bearing units in the crust. Because of the lack of easily dateable minerals in CTGDs, it has historically been challenging to determine when gold mineralization occurred. The result is that effective exploration is hampered by the lack of knowledge about how and when these deposits formed. In this study, a new method of dating these deposits will be refined and tested. If the ages of CTGD formation could be more definitively known, gold mineralization could be correlated to broader geologic processes that were occurring at the same time. This knowledge would enable scientists and explorers to more easily discover new deposits.<br/><br/>Available geochronological data suggest that Carlin-type mineralization broadly overlapped in space and time with the southwest sweep of Eocene magmatism through Nevada. Geo- and thermochronologic datasets are critical to identify direct evidence that magmatism and ore formation overlapped at individual deposits. Indeed, new chronometric tools could greatly expand knowledge of the genetic processes that lead to CTGD formation. No straightforward method currently exists to date CTDG mineralization. Recent studies have explored the use of the (U-Th)/He chronometer for Fe-oxides, but this chronometer has not been systematically tested in ore deposits. The proposed research has two major goals: to test feasibility of the Fe-oxide (U-Th)/He chronometer to date hydrothermal fluid flow, and to use this method to determine the age of hydrothermal activity in a CTGD in Nevada."

The approach under development in this project brings a novel application of exponential family theory to the job, with the goal of clarifying how empirical Bayes analyses converge to traditional Bayes methods as sample sizes increase. The project aims to develop empirical Bayes methods that use large-scale parallel data sets, such as those from microarray studies, to improve estimation in situations reporting many small sub-experiments, each of which by itself has low accuracy; and improved Monte Carlo methods for the computer solution of massive optimization problems.<br/><br/>Specific topics under investigation in this research project include large-scale empirical Bayes strategies, importance sampling for computer-assisted inference in formerly intractable situations, and a theory of stability assessment for traditional methods of accuracy estimation.  Exponential families of probability distributions play a central role in both computation and statistical inference. A particularly stubborn impediment to their use in massive data analyses is the lack of a suitable norming constant in the exponential family density. This research project further develops computational methods based on solutions of appropriate variational problems; a promising application is in the area of graphical models. A second application of exponential families involves efficient deconvolution of datasets to obtain empirical Bayes estimates."

Through a collaborative process involving dozens of universities and major geography organizations, the project will create a self-sustaining RCN whose members pursue multiple active lines of research that engender evidence-based practices, new knowledge and theory, more robust curricula, better standards and assessments, and expanded access to high-quality teacher training programs in geography. In practical terms, the RCN will work to raise the profile of geography education as a research field. Doing so will help the participating universities recruit more diverse cohorts of graduate students, increase faculty research productivity, and promote the use of research to improve the quality of geography teaching and learning in local communities. <br/><br/>The need for transformative research in geography education was given in-depth consideration by The Road Map for 21st Century Geography Education project funded by NSF from 2011-2013. The Road Map Project, which built on many prior efforts to assess the state of research in geography education, issued a landmark study and research agenda in 2013. The Road Map report considers many substantive issues as to what research topics and questions are most critical for ensuring long-term progress and improvements in student achievement. It also draws attention to the important methodological issue of how geography education research that aspires to be transformative should be designed. The Road Map Project's research agenda offers a set of recommendations for building research capacity and capability in geography education. It emphasizes scientific approaches to research planning and design as a strategy for moving beyond the descriptive, singular and anecdotal studies that at present characterize the geography education literature. Enacting this vision will require considerable coordination, collaboration and information sharing among geographers and educational researchers in other disciplines.

Any disturbance in the brain-body functional coupling affects one's ability to move efficiently, causing various movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease that is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 4 million worldwide. Acquiring deepened understanding of such movement disorders demands to study brain activity and body movements simultaneously. Due to technical constraints, traditional brain scanners such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) require the body to remain horizontal and motionless during scanning periods. Moreover, fMRI is bulky and immobile, providing one image per second, while the brain's activity occurs at a much faster rate. Hence, there is a limited knowledge of brain dynamics that are coupled tightly to body's mobility behaviors. In recent years, ""functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)"" is emerging as a portable, optical neuroimaging device that provide greater benefits compared to the bulky counterparts such as fMRI. The PI takes the fNIRS technology one step further by integrating it with the maturing technology of body sensor networks (BSN) to quantify brain-body connectivity. <br/><br/>The project aims to establish a medical cyber-physical system (mCPS) delivering the system integration of fNIRS and BSN. Specifically, the project mainly explores the following directions: System Integration: The mCPS is a system integration aggregating two complex subsystems (20-channel fNIRS system and 17-sensor body motion suit) to produce a unique interface delivering the overarching functionality of motion-tagged neuroimaging. Challenges in this project emerge from the heterogeneity of system components and interactions among them. In this work, system integration takes place into three forms: 1) ""hardware integration"" for centralizing the multimodal sensor data, 2) ""data integration/fusion"" for conditioning and fusing multi-dimensional task-level signals, and 3) ""presentation integration"" for combined visualization of brain and body behaviors. Motion-Tolerant Neuroimaging: It is expected that fNIRS neuroimaging data will face challenges of motion artifacts. Brain activity data would largely be superimposed by the mechanical vibrations traversed to the scalp due to the body movements. The PI explores harmonic sum models to rectify motion-affected brain activities to extract the more accurate hemodynamic response of the brain in mobile settings. A Clinical Screening Interface for Neurologists: The PI collaborates with a neurologist specialized in treating Parkinson's disease. The end result will be a clinical tool for physicians to screen the motor exams of patient with Parkinson's disease. The clinical tool is aimed at providing quantified data of motion and brain's cortical activities displayed side-by-side for the improved diagnostic screening of Parkinson's disease."

The American Southwest (here defined as Arizona, southern Utah, and southern Nevada) appears to be mostly inactive tectonically. However, there is evidence that large earthquakes have occurred here in recent geologic times. We explore the possibility that the amount of crustal deformation in this area (and thus can generate (large) earthquakes) varies with time and is modulated by large earthquakes in southern California and Gulf of California. We have seen evidence for this by using GPS observations of the deformation pattern before and after the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (M7.2). We will combine ongoing GPS measurements with different modeling tools to characterize and model the source of the time-variable and long-term deformation, which we aim to separate. The time-variable deformation can be understood as visco-elastic deformation in the lithosphere following large (far-field) earthquakes. The long-term deformation can likely be modeled by considering the proper ratio of the far-field stresses imposed by Pacific plate motion and stresses due to lateral variation in crustal thickness and density in our study area. <br/><br/>This is a follow-on proposal that extends our current EarthScope project on the Colorado Plateau area. Over the last five years, the long-term kinematics as measured by GPS are obscured by postseismic deformation from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, which occurred 3 months before we installed a new 34-station continuous network.  As a result, important questions on the role of Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) variations in driving deformation, the reasons for the dearth of active faults and seismicity in southern Arizona, and the reach of plate motion stresses remain unanswered.  In order to address these questions, and simultaneously further our understanding of the postseismic process, we propose a three-tiered approach: 1) extend existing GPS time-series to improve characterization of transient deformation, 2) use those data to explore the crustal and mantle viscosities required to match the GPS time-series data, and 3) create physical models of the long-term expected deformation, that includes the latest GPE estimates, to explain the residual motions after correction for postseismic effects. We will also leverage GPS data from other NSF funded projects, as well as seismic data products obtained by USArray that have helped to constrain crustal and lithospheric thickness structure and stress orientations. Geodetic strain rates could potentially be used as an independent constraint on the regional seismic hazard, but only after we have corrected it for all post-seismic effects, and assessed the long-term drivers of crustal motion. We will employ a female graduate student at UNR to work on the project. We will also engage a RESESS undergraduate intern during the summer of the second year. The goal of the RESESS program is to increase diversity in the Geosciences work force. We will recruit one student from the UA Disability Resource Center (DRC) to conduct a small research project associated with the larger goals of the overall project. We will also lead an accessible field trip to the Grand Canyon for students registered at the DRC in a program that we developed and implemented in September 2015.  The goal of these activities is to draw attention to the numerous research opportunities made available by the large volume of data in NSF and other national data archives, available to a wide range of individuals. Finally, we plan to give outreach talks at the area's parks and monuments.<br/>"

The complex domain of biology has causal pathways that are not always readily apparent to young children, and their explanations often contain many misconceptions and gaps in understanding. This project will add to a limited body of research on how children's recognition of information gaps influence subsequent interest in learning in formal and informal learning settings. The project will examine to what extent, if any, receiving or producing explanations motivates children's future learning, with three specific goals: (1) to examine whether children who first recognize that an explanation has significant gaps are interested in engaging in further learning of a particular topic; (2) to explore how the source of the explanation (by self or others) relates to the link between recognizing information gaps and future learning; and (3) to develop instructional strategies that can be used to induce students' recognition of explanatory gaps, measuring outcomes for these strategies, including children's subsequent ability to critically evaluate explanations and their interest in future learning. The conceptual framework will be guided by the social-cognitive theory, sociocultural theory, and mechanistic reasoning. This combined theoretical framing will promote a better assessment of which processes drive children's explanation evaluation - a crucial part of learning from others - and how mechanistic explanations can be useful lenses for analyzing the interactions of domain-specific (prior knowledge) and domain-general knowledge about learning.<br/><br/>This project will use laboratory-based quantitative methods and classroom-based teaching experiments. The quantitative methods include ANCOVAs of multiple covariates about a model that will be developed and implemented to explain developmental, individual, and task differences in responses to information gaps in scientific explanations. Behavioral measures will include ratings of explanation quality and individual difference measures, such as self-reported interest, biological knowledge, and interest in acquiring new information. Based on results from laboratory studies, scaffolds will be developed for classroom contexts to support children's productive engagement in critically evaluating biological explanations. A subset of the above measures will be use to collect pre-post data from classroom participants. Conjecture mapping will be used to conceptualize specific links between scaffolds, mediating processes, and outcomes. Classroom video and observations will be used to determine the extent to which the design scaffolds lead to the hypothesized mediating processes and ultimately the desired learning outcomes of effective evaluation and generation of mechanistic explanations of biological phenomena. Outcomes from these studies will advance scientific understanding of young children's explanation evaluation and construction, as well as provide a suite of scaffolds to support effective education practice. Combining lab and classroom-based research will lead to the development of more ecologically-valid methodologies for studying, and impacting, learning behaviors in ways that are beneficial to interdisciplinary research and education. Insights from the research will be beneficial to parents, children and teachers in both formal and informal settings. Finally, the project will provide insight into creating developmentally-appropriate interventions to help determine whether children of a certain age might benefit from instruction focused on recognizing explanatory gaps in order to motivate them to seek out better answers."

In a single molecular junction, perhaps the most elusive factor that influences the electron transport properties lies in the molecule-electrode contact interfaces. Despite continuous experimental achievements and the conceptual simplicity of molecular electronic devices, challenges for their theoretical understanding of the correlation between electron transport and molecular binding structures are still unresolved. Therefore, probing and controlling the structure and dynamics of single-molecule junctions and consequently controlling the molecular transport of these junctions are critical to the development of this field. The project will integrate molecular simulations for the self-assembly and nanocontact dynamics at surface and interface, and experimental mechanics and electron transport measurements of single-molecule junctions. The project will provide a deep understanding of many transition phenomena observed in molecular force and conductance measurements. If successful, the research will have tremendous impact on molecular electronics community and many other areas, such as energy research and molecular force spectroscopy. The education and outreach objective of this proposal is to tightly integrate the research efforts and results with graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education and to globally disseminate both research and the education outcomes.<br/>Technical:<br/>Although the electrical conductance and mechanical properties of single-molecule junctions have achieved significant progress over the past decade, challenges of a detailed understanding of molecular binding structures and electron transport, and the structure-force-conductance correlations, are still unresolved.

To preserve mechanical properties, one common treatment of the tissue is through chemical fixation, such as soaking in glutaraldehyde (GA).  However, GA treatment often leads to detrimental calcification of the implant. The goal of this proposal is to eliminate the need for GA treatment by coating the ECM with a novel biodegradable polymer coating (poly(propylene fumarate) or PPF) that will provide a reinforced substrate with many desirable properties.  Mechanical properties and degradation times are tunable.  Local bioactivity can be enhanced by embedding growth eluting microparticles in the PPF.  Thus, the resulting hybrid material will exhibit diminished calcification and immune response from the host and be resistant to rapid degradation while at the same time encouraging native tissue ingrowth. Successful development of this novel material would significantly improve the material options available and revolutionize expectations for many cardiovascular repair operations.

Many of the tissue based prosthetics used in cardiovascular surgery employ glutaraldehyde (GA)-treated pericardium. Pericardium possesses advantageous mechanical properties, but GA treatment invariably results in detrimental calcification of the implant. This study tests the hypothesis that by treating pericardium extracellular matrix (ECM) with a physical coating of the synthetic polymer poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), the resulting hybrid materials will not only exhibit diminished calcification and immune response upon implantation, but will provide a platform suitable for controlled regrowth and maintenance of the tissue.  The study will additionally test the hypothesis that the biologic and activity of the platform may be enhanced through the addition of growth factor eluting poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles. The ideal composition of both components (PPF and ECM) to obtain appropriate mechanical properties and degradation for a patch model will be determined and a 3D printing resin based on these formulations will be used to investigate the in vitro response to a random organization of the ECM. The performance of PPF-reinforced ECM and 3DP PPF-reinforced ECM will be evaluated in a rat subcutaneous model. The hybrid materials will be assessed for cellular ingrowth, newly produced proteins and signaling factors, as well as possible calcium deposits.  The Broader Impacts of the project include the development of a new class of hybrid biomaterials and the elucidation of new strategies and technologies within regenerative medicine.

This project will combine laboratory experiments and theoretical research to examine how biological diversity and environmental disturbance interact to affect invasion. Deeper insights into these processes will advance applied research as human modifications of the environment increase. The research extends a productive international collaboration and will train early-career US researchers in experimentation, mathematics, and theory. Freshman undergraduate students will be offered a research track that begins with a general course in research methods and is followed by additional seminars and independent research projects.

The researchers will independently manipulate disturbance frequency and intensity, and bacterial diversity, in a factorial design to assess the role that these factors (and their interactions) play in invasion resistance. They will also assess the hypothesized importance of adaptation to disturbance regimes by assessing invasion success following changes to previously established regimes. Laboratory microbial experiments will generate rapid results, allow iterative model improvement, and provide ideal opportunities to test rapid evolution. This combination surpasses research that could be accomplished with natural communities and promises to develop general ecological theory relevant to diverse, natural communities.

Vibrio cholerae is a well-known freshwater pathogen that is of concern in developing countries.  Two lesser known, but important human pathogens in the USA are from the same bacterial group: Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.  These are bacteria that are naturally found in estuarine systems, but they can also present a risk to human health when consumed in raw shellfish, or in rare cases, contacted in beach waters.  This project will translate knowledge gained through prior ecological research into technology that permits the design of user-friendly, rapid, molecular testing kits.  The existing ways to test for Vibrio species in water and shellfish samples are decades old, and they require 24-96 hours for results.  Even new molecular approaches  for testing of pathogenic forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are compromised by a lack of specificity and/or a need for an enrichment step to improve sensitivity, making them require almost a day for completion. This project will permit generation of new, rapid molecular diagnostics for virulent forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus using a new approach for determining useful targets for the kits. It is envisioned that these kits could be used to 1) certify that shellfish is safe for raw consumption, 2) protect the health of at risk populations for water contact, 3) determine the patterns associated with dangerous forms of the bacteria for improved warning systems. The funded project will result in the design of commercially available molecular testing kits that will be easy to use, and will provide results in 2-3 hours.  These features will permit accurate public notification and protection of public health.<br/><br/>This project addresses a specific knowledge gap in the transition from research to commercial application.  Vibrio sp. are complex bacterial organisms, that are naturally found in estuarine and coastal waters, but only a small subset of them are capable of causing disease.  The assembled team has valuable expertise in next generation sequence and sequence data approaches, Vibrio sp. ecology, and Vibrio sp. pathogenicity. The combination of knowledge permits known virulent (pathogenic) Vibrio samples to be analyzed for specific sets of  ""DNA motifs"" that are related to the capability of the bacteria to cause disease.  From a repetitive process of analyzing known virulent and avirulent cells, the project team can identify the DNA motifs, or signatures that can be used to design a DNA test kit.  Subsequently, through support from this project the molecular test kits will be developed, optimized, validated, and commercialized.<br/><br/>In addition to the technical activities, undergraduates, senior graduate students, and post doctoral research associates as well as research assistant professors will be supported on this project. The will be exposed to a wide range of research and technology transfer activities, including market assessment, field based sampling and study, laboratory sample preparation, culture and molecular based analyses of samples, next generation sequence data annotation and analyses, and kit design and optimization. The project will be synergistic and contribute directly to the Molecular Training Facility run by PI Noble, where water quality professionals come to learn appropriate use of qPCR approaches and interpretation of qPCR data for water quality management.<br/><br/> The project also engages the Marine Biotechnologies-Center of Innovation, a group dedicated to advancing the translation of marine science research to commercial application.

Orion Integrated Biosciences is a company dedicated to the advancement of unique and disruptive computational approaches to survey ""big data"" for sequence and molecular application. This project will directly impact the advancement of marine metagenomics due to the fact that the project team is utilizing a holistic approach to target complex organisms. The project is novel in that the approach moves away from the ""single gene target"" qPCR design approach, permitting the generation of diagnostic kits that are rapid, and cost-effective that shellfish harvesting, and water quality managers can use to manage precious resources and protect public health."

An ideal synthetic skin must be flexible, scalable, easy to wrap around limbs, able to detect touch and force from surrounding objects, and protect against or limit the spread of microbes. Large-area, skin-like sensors for detecting spatial distributions of touch, pressure, and impact will be useful for a number of applications ranging from civil infrastructure to prosthetics to robotics to structural health monitoring of ground and aerospace vehicles. To enable these future applications, the proposed work will include design rules to aid engineers in scaling up imprint lithography and assembly for roll-to-roll processing of synthetic skins. Lightweight, inexpensive skin will prevent life-threatening disasters, such as those linked to undetected structural damage (e.g., the catastrophic impact damage from loose tiles on space shuttle Columbia). The active antimicrobial protection will sterilize robots, machines, or wearable garments in sterile or contaminated environments. The industrial and artistic collaborators will provide materials and guidance to the research team working toward commercially viable processing and assembly. Undergraduate and high school students will have opportunities to build paper-based devices with skin-like sensing through their participation in the Rutgers Honors College, Byrne Seminars, Aresty Research Center, and the New Jersey Governor's School of Engineering and Technology. <br/><br/>The research objective of this GOALI proposal is to create scalable, skin-like sensing devices made of tunable paper-based composites with capabilities of sensing touch, measuring spatial distributions of forces, and providing plasma-based sterilization.

However, in some cases the energetic cost of producing an ornament does not appear to be large, and, thus, it is not clear what limits individuals from producing elaborate ornaments. In common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) males with larger black facial masks are preferred as mates by females, yet producing the color of the mask feathers is not thought to be costly. In this project, the researchers will examine the physiological processes associated with producing larger black ornaments by studying the expression of genes in developing ornamental (facial mask) and non-ornamental (back) feathers. The goal of this research is to test three hypotheses that predict which genes are of importance during the development of ornaments and, thus, determine what information these ornaments are signaling to potential mates. A deeper understanding of feather development will also be of interest to other disciplines, including those concerned with avian disease and husbandry. The researchers will share the results of this study through public presentations at local nature centers, in addition to presentations at scientific conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals. <br/><br/>The production of elaborate   ornaments selected through mate choice is likely affected by the expression of genes involved in important physiological processes. Genes that may be of particular importance during ornament development include those involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS hypothesis), immune function (Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis), and growth (e.g., insulin and insulin-like growth factor genes; insulin/IGF hypothesis). In common yellowthroats the black facial mask is thought to honestly signal male quality because mask size is positively related to immune gene (MHC class II) variation, antibody production, and resistance to oxidative stress. In this study, researchers will use RNA-sequencing to determine if genes involved in important physiological functions (e.g., OXPHOS, immune, insulin/IGF) are more highly expressed in developing feathers that form part of a sexually selected ornament (the mask) than those from other non-sexually selected parts of the plumage (the back). This research will provide the first comparison of transcriptomes of developing ornamental and non-ornamental feathers."

Learning the specific mechanistic details of natural phenomena and devices is often envisioned as an ideal goal of STEM learning, yet such information is typically forgotten soon after instruction by children, as well as by adults.  The researchers will pursue the hypothesis that such mechanisms should still be taught because, after the specific details have been forgotten, what remains promotes enduring representations and facilitates higher order learning. This alternative view emphasizes learning that much more closely mirrors how informal science (and often formal science as well) actually works. This project will build on recent cognitive science discoveries about the kinds of knowledge that are most robustly represented both in folk science and in formal science. Four sets of experiments will explore developmental changes in preferences for mechanistic explanations, what is retained from exposure, the effects of different learning goals on the use of mechanistic information in learning STEM content, and the development of abilities to infer internal mechanistic structures. If the hypothesis is supported, the results will suggest that exposure to causal mechanistic information is essential to early science education and that such content should not be omitted even though its details are forgotten. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning, and has implications for education in both formal and informal settings. <br/><br/>This project will involve four sets of randomized controlled experiments, primarily with children at grades K, 2, and 4. Study Set 1 will explore the cognitive basis and development of children's preference for explanations that involve a causal mechanism.  The researchers will use a choice paradigm that contrasts mechanistic explanations with other forms of information. Children will be asked which explanation they would like to learn more about for a given object. Strong preferences for mechanistic information are predicted at all ages, but with developmental differences relating to overall complexity, the domains queried, and kinds of mechanism involved. Study Set 2 will present children with mechanistic explanations for devices and biological entities. Children will then be assessed for retention of mechanistic details, functional properties, non-mechanistic details, judged complexity, broad causal patterns such as causal centrality and potency, and which of two experts to consult to learn more about the entity.  These children will be compared to control children who will also learn about the same internal parts but with no causal or functional language that reveals mechanism. Rapid decay of detailed mechanistic information is expected in both groups, but the mechanism group should show more enduring memories for information relating to complexity, centrality, and expertise domains.  Study Set 3 will focus on goal framing. The researchers will first look at children's and adults' intuitions about what is retained after exposure to causal mechanistic explanations, expecting a strong explicit bias favoring retention of vivid details and a neglect of what actually endures and is most often used.  Later studies will ask how different learning goals interact with mechanism instruction. Greater enjoyment, engagement, feelings of accomplishment and retention of information are predicted with learning goals stressing more cognitively feasible and useful outcomes. Study Set 4 will focus on complexity intuitions. The investigators will look at how internal complexity is inferred for devices and animals based on behavioral diversity. They will also explore how mechanistic complexity is instantiated in different domains."

There are often many different ways of solving the same problem, and running these different solutions on a computer can cost drastically different amounts of time, memory, power, money, or other resources.  Given limited resources, it is often the case that one solution will accomplish a desired goal, while another solution will fail to do so -- not because the solution is wrong in principle, but because it would cost too much. Therefore, programmers need to be able to predict how much a solution will cost before actually running it, in order to predict whether a proposed solution will successfully accomplish the desired goals.  In this project, the principal investigators, along with a postdoctoral fellow and students, are investigating new techniques for predicting the resources used by programs.  The intellectual merits of the project are advancing the state of the art in interactive reasoning about program cost, building on several different areas of computer science research.  The project is investigating methods that can be implemented in interactive tools, so that a computer can help with making these cost predictions and checking that programmers' predictions are correct.  The project's broader significance and importance are improving the quality of software, by making it easier for programmers to both code in a high-level language and reason precisely and formally about the cost of their programs, leading to faster and more maintainable code.  The project is training undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers for scientific careers.  Finally, the techniques developed by this project may inform the development of pedagogical tools for computer science students.<br/><br/>More technically, this project is developing the foundations of a tool that programmers can use to semi-automatically analyze the execution cost of programs, in the style of an interactive theorem prover or proof assistant. The main topic of investigation is formally certified methods for the extraction and solution of cost recurrences from source code -- a method of cost analysis that allows a smooth transition between automated and manual verification methods, and is applicable to a wide class of programs.  The investigators' prior work in this area shows that the process of extracting recurrences from higher-order functional programs on programmer-defined inductive datatypes can be viewed as a translation from the source language to a complexity language, followed by a semantic interpretation of the complexity language. This method is certified by a bounding theorem, proved by logical relations, which implies that the cost predicted by the recurrences bounds the execution cost of the program on all inputs. This project is extending these techniques to more fully-featured source languages (e.g., supporting general recursion and coinductive datatypes); to other forms of cost analyses (e.g., parallel cost and amortized analysis); and to deeper analysis of extracted recurrences (e.g., methods for solving higher-order recurrences; a syntactic logic for manipulating recurrences). The project is developing formalizations and implementations of the proposed techniques, and applying the techniques to verifying compiler optimizations."

On average 2 volcanoes are in a state of eruption every year. Volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Cook Inlet are capable of sudden, explosive, ash-cloud forming eruptions, which are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight aircraft along this heavily travelled air corridor. Many of Alaska?s volcanoes are in remote locations with harsh environments. Monitoring these volcanoes represents a formidable challenge and many of the volcanoes are not instrumented. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below the 20 Hz hearing threshold of the human ear) is a rapidly developing technology to understand and monitor explosive volcanic eruptions. Modest-sized explosive eruptions produce powerful infrasound signals that propagate efficiently over thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. However, to date, these signals have been recorded by sparse infrasound sensor networks, limiting our understanding of their source generation and propagation through the atmosphere. The EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) is currently being deployed in Alaska, bringing the densest ever combined seismic and infrasonic network to one of the world?s most active volcanic regions. Exploiting this novel dataset, this project will advance the capability of acoustic early warning systems of volcanic eruptions for aviation safety and will assess the potential contribution of large sensor networks such as the TA to volcano monitoring. At the end of the project, an operational volcano-acoustic monitoring system resulting from this work will be implemented at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.<br/><br/>This work will capitalize on the unprecedented seismo-acoustic dataset starting to become available as the TA records Alaska?s routine explosive volcanism with dense spatial wavefield sampling. Volcano seismo-acoustics is a rapidly advancing research field, where basic questions remain on the source mechanisms, source directionality, atmospheric propagation, and seismo-acoustic coupling from explosive volcanic eruptions. This project will focus on detection, discrimination, and location of the signals using novel methods; quantifying the seismo-acoustic wavefield; investigating the source mechanisms; quantifying seismo-acoustic wave coupling; and understanding infrasound propagation in the spatio-temporally varying atmosphere. Through a combination of data analysis and modeling, we will characterize and quantify diverse seismic and infrasonic signals recorded at a range of distances and directions from the explosive eruption source. We will address the following questions: (1) How do observed acoustic and seismic signals from explosive volcanic eruptions vary with distance and azimuth to the source? (2) How does acoustic propagation differ for various types of explosive eruptions? (3) What kind of volcanic source information can be determined from long-range seismo-acoustic data? (4) What are the wavefield sampling limitations in previous volcano infrasound studies? (5) What other infrasound sources are present in Alaska? Our team will work with the EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to help highlight this research and its impacts. Multi-media products illustrating seismo-acoustic wavefields from volcanic eruptions in Alaska will be distributed via the web for use in public information packets and education and outreach. Event catalogs and related data products will be publically available, with notable infrasound events uploaded to the IRIS TA Infrasound Reference Event Database (TAIRED).<br/>"

Protists, which are single-cell microbes that are abundant in soil, can spontaneously engulf nanoparticles and carry them through soil.

One arm of the rift extends from Lake Superior to Oklahoma and the other through central Michigan to perhaps as far south as Alabama. Where exposed in the Lake Superior (or Keweenaw) region, surface observations and geophysical data indicate that the rift basin is filled with flood basalts, which are unusual landforms whose formation can have a devastating influence on climate and life. Most flood basalts around the world occur in so-called Large Igneous Provinces in which rapid eruption of a large volume of basaltic magma, created by deeper mantle processes (mantle plumes), flows great distances over existing topography to form a thick stack of lava flows. However, flood basalts of the Mid-Continent Rift depart significantly from this norm, occupying a relatively small space and erupted significant volumes for about 20 million years. These characteristics are difficult to explain solely through the traditional mechanisms proposed for the generation of flood basalts. This project explores the idea that the Mid-Continent Rift formed as a combination of rifting and interaction with deeper a mantle plume thus having characteristics of both a rift and a Large Igneous Province. Besides forming a fundamental structure of the North American continent, the Mid-continent Rift hosts important copper ore deposits in the Lake Superior region. The project would advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved STEM education and educator development through development of teaching modules and workshops for formal and informal educators; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through continuation of ongoing place-based outreach in national and state parks; and (3) development of a competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate students and by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In contrast to typical rifts that are filled with a mixture of clastic sediments, volcanoclastics, and lava flows, the 3000-km Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift is filled with flood basalt with thicknesses that exceed even most large igneous provinces. These observations can be resolved by considering the Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift as a hybrid rift and mantle plume-generated large igneous province. In this model, the volcanics were deposited during an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a post-rift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding sag basin without associated faulting. This project addresses the question of how the rift and plume interacted, including the possibility of lengthy interaction between an initially distant plume via material flow at the base of the lithosphere. Specifically, the project will use major and trace element analysis, isotopic characterization (Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf), and argon geochronology of rift basalts to determine: (1) the geochemical signatures of the source reservoirs contributing to the basalts and their change over time; and (2) the temperatures, pressures, and source composition(s) of melt generation. The project employs a 2D parallel primitive variable particle-in-cell finite-difference method to study the behavior and melt formation of rifting under Precambrian mantle conditions in the absence or presence of a plume and geodynamic modeling to constrain the extent of lateral migration of plume material under Precambrian mantle conditions coupled with a model for melting and melt extraction. Rifting history is determined from the cusp in the apparent polar wander path and microplate kinematics from gravity modeling."

However, incorporating rock strength into landscape evolution models has been a challenging problem. This is due in part to difficulties in defining appropriate metrics to describe rock strength, and because the factors that determine rock strength vary in importance depending on erosion process. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by testing the hypothesis that in steep landscapes, rock strength exerts a first order control on landscape-scale erodibility through the influence of fracture density on bedrock hillslopes and the resulting grain size distribution of sediment delivered to channels.<br/> <br/>By comparing topographic metrics of hillslope and channel relief with erosion rates determined from cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in stream sediment, this project will characterize differences in erodibility between two landscapes in Southern California with similar topography, rock type, and climate, but strongly contrasting tectonic history and bedrock fracture density. This project will take advantage of new ground-based photogrammetry techniques and analysis of high-resolution airborne lidar data to upscale field observations and measurements to entire landscapes. Development and testing of novel point-cloud and image-based analysis techniques will provide training and experience for geoscience undergraduates through classroom laboratory exercises and independent research projects. Results from this project will provide a framework for making progress on the challenging task of expanding site-specific correlations between relief and erosion rate to regions with differing rock strength and climate, and inform provocative hypotheses regarding potential feedbacks between tectonic setting and bedrock fracturing that limit the height of mountain ranges."

Although classically defined as a single boundary offsetting two segments of a MOR, TFs can split into several fault strands and subsequently re-unify to a single trace. Formation of segmented TFs is likely due to extensional tectonic motions across the TF. Conversely, unification of segmented TFs may be associated with compressional tectonic motions, however, the processes governing this evolution are poorly known. Structural features on the ocean floor, such as fracture zones (FZs), faults, and topography produced by lithospheric deformation, record tectonic responses to plate motions oblique to the original TF.  In collaboration with Dr. Seung-Sep Kim of Chungnam National University, an expert in marine geology, flexure, and tectonics, the PI will quantify the processes that govern unification of the previously segmented Clarion FZ in the central Pacific Ocean. Segmentation and unification of TFs can alter the location of plate boundaries over time. Quantifying segmentation processes will enhance our understanding of evolving plate boundaries as well as their magmatic and seismic expressions.<br/><br/>The research has 3 primary goals: 1) Using recently acquired high-resolution bathymetry over the Clarion FZ provided by the host researcher, Dr. Kim, we will identify styles and distributions of deformation; 2) We will analyze flexural evolution of a segmented FZ using 2D numerical models; 3) We will assess the tectonic conditions of the Clarion FZ through time by comparing model-predicted gravity anomalies (a proxy for flexural evolution of a FZ) to shipboard measurements. To quantify the hypothesized effect of compression on TF unification, our models will compare various rates and magnitudes of compressional strain, age offsets across the FZ, as well as the number, age, and geometry of intra-transform spreading segments to predicted flexural profiles.  Finally, using these results we plan to develop predictive scaling laws that relate tectonic compression to the location and timing of TF unification.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Specifically, the project investigates the mathematics behind portfolios that outperform a standard index such as S&P 500 in the presence of volatility. The utility of such portfolios is that in that process they reduce volatility demonstrably, and thus contribute to the stability of financial markets. Although ad hoc use of such portfolios is widespread, a systematic mathematical study has been limited so far. It turns out the mathematics is related to some very modern topics in probability and geometry, especially that of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport maps. Successful completion of the research will not only lead to striking new mathematics in probability and information geometry, but will also imply very practical applications in modern portfolio management, with potential societal benefits of the highest level via increased financial stability. <br/><br/>The investigator plans to study an array of problems linking the fields of optimal transport and interacting particle systems, with applications to modern portfolio theory. There are two parts to this project. The first one investigates the behavior of exponential stochastic integrals where the integrand is given by a solution of a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport map. The study is an interesting interplay between geometry of the unit simplex and universal behavior of stochastic integrals when they are not martingales. Classical probability relies heavily on the martingale property of stochastic integrals. Here, the investigator explores a completely distinct class of behaviors that should be of independent interest. The second part studies properties of interacting continuous-time particle systems in finite and infinite dimensions. These particle systems, originally coming from stochastic portfolio theory, can be thought of as a continuous-time analogue of the discrete time exclusion process on the integer lattice. However, unlike exclusion processes, very little is known about these processes. They are conjectured to display striking phase transitions. The project aims to establish concentration inequalities and fluctuation estimates (among other properties) for such processes, which is a step towards proving more subtle behavior of these processes."

This project aims to develop a new approach that is expected to be both sensitive and reliable. The new approach is based on synergy of light-excited electron oscillation and chemical reaction occuring simultaneously on specialized nanostructures. <br/><br/><br/>In biosensing, an unmet need is ultrasensitive detection (like polymerase chain reaction, PCR) with accurate quantitation (like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA). This ability is sorely needed for protein biomarkers which cannot be PCR-amplified, or constrained by time, sample quantity, or resources. To meet this need, a novel concept of multimodal signal amplification by collaborative plasmonic intensification and catalytic multiplication (c-PI/CM) is proposed. The central intellectual merit is to exploit the collaborative synergy between PI and CM. Collaborative PI/CM is not simply enhancing one modality by the other, but the collaboration and positive reinforcement between the two modalities. Thus, PI/CM is fundamentally different from, for example, plasmon-enhanced ELISA.  To test this hypothesis, the PI will design a series of experiments to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of c-PI/CM by investigating their interplay on standard plasmonic nanostructures fabricated by nanolithography. A second hypothesis is to test whether c-PI/CM would perform better on recently developed nanoporous gold (NPG) disks which exhibits intrinsic catalytic functions, high-density, three dimensionally distributed plasmonic field enhancement sites (also known as, hot spots), order-of-magnitude larger surface area, and excellent structural integrity and environmental stability, all pointing to a more plausible high-performance c-PI/CM platform. Several in situ monitoring techniques will be used to assess sensing performance: LSPR shift, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF)."

HCOMP is a cross-disciplinary conference that combines human-centered methods and traditional computer science to address fundamental issues in human computation and crowdsourcing.  It brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas such as human-computer interaction, psychology, economics, social computing, machine learning, information retrieval, databases and systems.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.humancomputation.com/2016/.  The Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused meeting that immediately precedes the conference, on October 30, and will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by developing a group of promising young researchers interested in human computation and crowdsourcing. The award will also enable these young researchers to attend the HCOMP 2016 conference, thus allowing them to interact with other researchers and conference events; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to observe the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in human computation.  The Doctoral Consortium Chairs will select about six additional distinguished researchers to serve as faculty mentors; this group also will serve as the review committee for student applications. Students will be selected based on a paper giving an overview of the student's dissertation research, an explanation of why the student wants to participate in the Doctoral Consortium, a CV, and a letter of support from the student's advisor. The organizers will give preference to students who are most in need of mentoring and joining a peer group.  Moreover, the organizers will promote diversity among the selected students by selecting no more than two students from any one school, and by prioritizing the selection of women and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>The full-day Doctoral Consortium will include activities to guide the research of these promising young researchers. The Consortium will allow participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor and from fellow students. The feedback will be geared toward helping the student participants understand and articulate how their research is positioned relative to other work on human computation and crowdsourcing.  The feedback will also address whether the students' topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented.  Activities led by the faculty will include a panel discussion to give students more information about the process and lessons of research and life in academia and industry. To further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, students will have a chance to present their work as posters in an interactive poster session and their papers will be posted online on the workshop webpage. These activities will benefit the participants by offering each fresh perspectives and comments on their work from researchers outside their own institution, both from faculty and other students; providing a supportive setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; and enabling participants to form a cohort of new researchers."

Patients are quarantined while monitored by lab-based methods, which are laborious, expensive, and requires days for cross-validated results. A rapid diagnostic tool that detects MERS-CoV with high sensitivity and specificity is crucial for preventing further outbreaks. This project aims to fabricate rapid assays that can detect MERS-CoV Spike protein. Spike protein has gained recognition as a high research priority target and serves as a positive mimic for the virus. Smartphone-based analysis enables point-of-care (POC) diagnostics without requiring laboratory expertise and resources. This collaborative project will be performed with Dr. Seungjoo Haam at Yonsei University, South Korea. Dr. Haam has conducted extensive research on fabricating light-sensitive nanostructures that are target-specific, which is critical for efficient detection of MERS-CoV.<br/><br/>This project includes fabrication of a rapid, POC microfluidic paper analytical device (µPAD) for sensitive and specific detection of Spike protein. µPADs have gained momentum as an advantageous lab-on-a-chip that makes disease diagnostics cost-effective, are operable by non-experts, and with rapid assay time within 30 s. The PI has expertise in µPAD fabrication and antibody-conjugation on submicron particles for pathogen detection from bio-complex matrices by measuring optical signal change from smartphone-based analysis. However, the optical signal change can be greatly enhanced by the use of Spike protein antibody conjugated to gold nanorods (GNRs), which are light-sensitive and respectively exhibits near-infrared absorbance for a long period upon irradiation. The synergistic product of PI?s µPADs and the collaborator?s GNRs may result in a highly effective lab-on-a-chip system, that enables rapid, POC detection of Spike protein with improved sensitivity and specificity that is unbound to clinical or poor-resource settings. Future work may include detection of other respiratory diseases, such as H1N1 influenza. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Many eukaryotic cells have internal compasses that allow them to sense these cues, often in the form of gradients of chemoattractant, voltage, or mechanical stress, and bias their motion in a specific direction. Electrotaxis, the phenomenon by which cells bias their motion directionally in response to an externally applied electrical field, is important in a number of cellular processes; however, the underlying physical mechanism of how electric fields are transduced into the cell to influence cytoskeletal organization is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the relevant physical mechanisms responsible for initiating electrotaxis in cells. The goal will be achieved by observing electrotactic migration and quantifying the ion activity surrounding electrotaxing cells using precise microfluidic cell confinement chambers. The specific objectives are:  1) to develop and build microfluidic confinement geometries for cell membrane level analysis of electrokinetic ion flux during electrotaxis, 2) to quantify the electric field-induced membrane processes including ion-flow and ion channel activity during electrotaxis, and 3) to understand how downstream cell signaling is activated and transduced by these upstream electric field-induced events.

The proof of the classification theorem, however, is very long and complicated, consisting of as many as ten thousand pages spread among hundreds of articles.

An emerging area of mathematics, studying objects called fusion systems, offers hope of simplifying the proof of the classification using an innovative approach that the investigator aims to implement. <br/><br/>The research focuses on two projects. First, the work aims to extend the current description of the subgroup structure of the finite simple groups, and to use that information to establish a negative answer to an important question in universal algebra, open for over 35 years: Is each finite lattice an interval in the lattice of subgroups of some finite group?  The second project aims to classify a large subclass of the class of simple saturated 2-fusion systems of component type. One consequence of the second project should be a simplification of the proof of the theorem classifying the finite simple groups."

In facing a cabinet door, a human can instantly identify the location of a handle, understand how to interact with it, and predict what the interaction would cause in a scene. Understanding object functionality with full consideration of interactions and dynamics is an essential but missing capability in computing. The understanding of such object functionalities facilitates novel applications in a broad spectrum. First, the project changes how robots influences our society. Rescue robots becomes able to operate in uncontrolled, unexpected, and disastrous environments to help the lives of trapped victims. Home-robots becomes more deeply involved in our daily activities, helping us from household chores to the care of the elderly in the aging societies. The project enables to construct functional object models easily for 3D printing, a technology that is already revolutionizing the world through applications in art, fashion, human health-care, construction, and more. At the emergence of virtual reality and augmented reality, where interactions with the virtual environments are becoming more ubiquitous, this project also enables to easily add ""lives"" to virtual assets and create ""live"" virtual environments for better training and education.<br/><br/>This research studies a computational framework and algorithms to construct, learn, and infer functional object models. The following two key observations are at the heart of the project. First, objects are designed for optimal functionality, and careful physics-based reasoning should automatically reveal the information. For example, if the handle of a cabinet door is in the middle, the door should slide-forward to minimize the amount of necessary forces and torques. Second, functionalities are universal across object categories. For example, an act of opening is not fundamentally different from cabinet doors, laundry machines, ovens, to refrigerators. The approach discovers object functionality by integrating segmentation, motion estimation, and kinematic inference problems into a novel physics-driven formulation. The research team develops algorithms to learn and infer object functionalities from images, RGBD images, and 3D models. The project opens up a new frontier of research, functional object modeling, as well as introduces a principled new yet general computational framework incorporating physics."

First, a small cluster of cells increases dramatically in number, then transforms into an exquisitely organized organ with a complicated pattern of connections.  Most of the time, this process results in brains that are perfectly normal, with the right number of nerve cells.  Surprisingly little is known, though, about how the growing brain decides how many cells to produce.   This research project will look at the control of cell number in the growing brains of transparent living zebrafish during the first few days of life.  The PI has developed techniques for watching clusters of dividing cells over time in special zebrafish embryos whose brain cells glow with unique combinations of colors (called ""Brainbow"").  This coloring allows new cells to be followed as they divide off from their mother cell.  So far it appears that families of cells (mother cell with her set of daughter cells) compete with other families to survive in the growing brain.  This type of competition has not been seen before in the brain, and may be responsible for controlling growth - not only in the brain, but in other organs as well.  The PI will test which genes are important for cell families to survive this competition.  The work will generate a number of new research tools that will be shared with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will perform and analyze  the experiments themselves, providing rich opportunities for research training early in developing scientists' careers.  By also transforming the data they have personally collected into an interactive, educational website, students will learn various digital media approaches to making scientific material understandable to traditional and non-traditional audiences.  The colorful images produced by this research have great appeal to both scientists and non-scientists, making it easier for students to learn how to engage the public with their work.<br/>  <br/>To study dynamic cellular behavior in the living brain, the PI has developed an approach using in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging and multicolor fluorescent protein (Brainbow) expression in zebrafish.  Using this technique, the PI has shown that programmed cell death occurs non-randomly in the living brain, with specific neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny (entire clones) undergoing cell death in a coordinated manner, while neighboring clones appear normal. If whole clones of dividing cells are in fact competing with one another, increases or decreases in cellular fitness should influence a clone's competitive edge.  The planned research will use a mosaic approach to alter gene expression in individual cells, coupled with global Brainbow expression to simultaneously follow dynamics within multiple clones of dividing cells.  Cellular fitness will be targeted via both cell-intrinsic mechanisms (cell cycle, c-myc activity) and cell-extrinsic mechanisms (access to extracellular BMP signaling).  These experiments will test directly whether cellular fitness influences a clone?s ability to survive in the developing brain.  Overall this may support the hypothesis that competition among clones of dividing cells helps regulate neuronal production and growth in the developing nervous system."

These chemical weathering processes are also one of the primary means by which the Earth system naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Hence, high surface areas observed in sediments implies high ""weatherability"" which in turn translates to more potential carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. Therefore, chemical weathering in high surface area glacial sediments may have significant impacts on Earth's carbon cycle. The researchers will measure the chemical and physical properties of sediments previously collected from the Dry Valleys to understand what factors lead to production of sediment with high-surface area and potential ""weather ability"" and investigate how sediment produced in these glacial systems could ultimately impact Earth's carbon budget. Results from this research will help scientists (including modelers) refine predictions of the effects of melting glaciers- and attendant exposure of glacial sediment? on atmospheric carbon levels. These results may also contribute to applied research efforts on development of carbon-dioxide removal technologies utilizing principles of rock weathering. In addition to the scientific benefits, this research will involve several students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels, including science education undergraduates, thus contributing to training of the next-generation STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Physical weathering produces fresh surfaces, greatly enhancing specific surface area (SSA) and reactive surface area (RSA) of primary minerals. Quantifying SSA and RSA of sediments is key to determining dissolution and leaching rates during natural weathering, but few data exist on distribution of sediment SA, particularly in glacial and fluvial systems. Pilot data from glacial stream systems in Taylor Valley and Wright Valley (located in the MDV) exhibit remarkably high and variable values in both SSA and RSA, values that in some cases greatly exceed values from muds in temperate glacial systems. This discovery motivates the current research, which aims to investigate the hypothesis that high and variable SAs of muds within Wright and Taylor Valleys reflect textural and/or compositional inheritance from the differing depositional settings within the MDV, biologic controls, dust additions, and/or pedogenic processes. These hypotheses will be tested by sedimentologically, mineralogically, and geochemically characterizing muds from glacially derived sediment deposited in various environments (cold vs. wet based glaciation; fluvial, lacustrine, dust, and drift deposits) and of varying age (Miocene to Modern) from the MDV and quantifying variation of SA and reactivity. Comparisons with analyzed muds from temperate glacial systems will enable polar-temperate comparisons. Analyses will focus on muds of previously collected sediment from the MDVs. Grain size and SSA will be measured by Laser Analysis and N2 adsorption BET, respectively. After carbonate removal, samples will be re-analyzed for SSA, and muds characterized geochemically. Mineralogy and bulk chemistry will also be assessed on co-occurring sand fractions, and textural attributes documented. SSA-normalized dissolution experiments will be used to compare solutes released from sediments to determine RSAs. Results will be integrated with the various sedimentologic and geochemical analyses to test the posed hypotheses. Ultimately, this research should shed light on how weathering in Antarctic systems contributes to global carbon cycling."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Manuela Dal Forno is ""Using museum specimens to explore the diversity and variation of lichen microbiomes in space and time."" The host institution for this fellowship is the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Eric Schuettpelz and Martin Grube.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to evaluate whether biological collections can be used to study characteristics of the microbiome (microbial communities composed of many species, living within plants, fungi and animals). This research is important because if microbiomes do not change significantly over time while housed in museum specimens (i.e., they represent microbiomes found in living organisms at the time they were collected), this opens up a remarkable opportunity to analyze the microbiomes of millions of samples already deposited in museums worldwide, facilitating the study of many biological questions. This research explores this question using lichens and their microbiomes as a model system. Lichens were long thought to be symbiotic associations of just two organisms (or rarely three), fungi plus photosynthetic algae and/or cyanobacteria. However, we now realize that lichens harbor diverse microbiomes, which may vary over space and time. The Fellow is examining museum lichen collections and testing the hypothesis that observed microbiomes represent those living in the lichen when it was collected (i.e., when it was alive), utilizing new and existing collections of tropical lichens from Brazil, Panama, and Jamaica. The research is risky to the extent that the Fellow may find that microbiomes cannot be adequately characterized from collection specimens, but whether or not this is the case, the findings have broad implications for future research on the microbiome dynamics of lichens and other organisms (e.g., plants) that are maintained under similar museum conditions. The results will also be used to determine how microbiomes vary within and among lichen species, and how they vary with changes in the environment. <br/><br/>The Fellow is acquiring valuable training in areas such as comparative microbiome analyses, bioinformatics, and the handling of large data sets and data layers from collections portals, ecological statistics, and the establishment of novel pipelines. During a visit to the Institute of Plant Sciences, University of Graz, Austria, the Fellow will learn the fluorescence techniques and use it on selected samples. All of these new skills are important for developing a strong interdisciplinary research program that merges traditional taxonomy with modern molecular techniques and data analyses. The Fellow is mentoring high school and undergraduate students of historically underrepresented groups, while also creating opportunities for the inclusion of lichens in all levels of education. Internships and public outreach activities are utilizing existing programs available at the National Museum of Natural History, and being expanded to local citizen science communities and institutions in the greater Washington DC metropolitan area. Educational products include protocols, portfolios and field guides for lichen identification."

This carbon is typically released after tree death through the actions of fungi and other microorganisms that consume woody debris, breaking it down  and releasing carbon into the soil and atmosphere (as carbon dioxide). Most of what is known about wood decay fungi comes from observations of reproductive fruiting bodies, such as mushrooms, but this is only one stage of the life cycle of these fungi. In this project, fungal activities will be studied over the course of the forest growing season and over the developmental life cycle of fungi to measure the amount of wood decay activity, and to determine the factors that control the process. These results will significantly improve our understanding of the role wood decay fungi play in releasing stored carbon now and under changing global conditions. <br/><br/>This project will provide needed insight into the functioning of wood decay fungal communities by examining the phenology of extracellular enzyme production throughout the year. The researchers will use recent advances in sequencing methods to determine when fungi are actively expressing decay genes, and how decay activity is affected by community diversity, substrate quality, and environmental conditions. High throughput sequencing will be used to compare decay gene expression through time by capturing populations of messenger RNAs, and to identify shifts in the active fungal community using ribosomal RNA. Sequencing data will be complemented with extracellular enzyme assays and measurements of respiration, to quantify the activity levels of enzymes targeting specific wood components and rate of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere, respectively. The drivers of decay activity and fungal community changes will be compared with those affecting fruiting body production."

The work studies the analytic theory of L-functions, which are fundamental objects in number theory that encode arithmetic information. Examples include the Riemann zeta-function, which encodes information about prime numbers, Dirichlet L-functions, which encode information about the equidistribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, and the L-functions associated with modular forms, which encode the equidistribution of more complex sequences, including rational points on elliptic curves. The investigator aims to develop a theoretical framework to explain by number theoretic means the statistical behavior of the values and zeros of such L-functions.<br/><br/>The investigator and collaborators plan work in a variety of projects, each involved with some aspect of L-functions. One project begins with a novel approach to understanding moments of the Riemann zeta-function through a study of convolutions of correlations of shifted divisor functions.

Another project is to improve bounds on the proportion of zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. A third project involves work related to an approach to the Riemann Hypothesis as a mollification problem; it is to understand an exact formula for the second moment of the zeta-function multiplied by a specific long Dirichlet polynomial. A fourth project is to prove that at least 60% of the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical line."

Professor Thomas Hermann of the University of California, San Diego, develops nano-sized, self-assembling sensors for biologically-active molecules (analytes) including toxins in the environment and metabolites in organisms. The sensors are made from biocompatible building blocks which self-assemble upon analyte detection by exploiting recognition principles encoded in natural nucleic acids. The design approach allows the construction of sensors that detect a variety of different analytes simultaneously.  A signal is generated only if a threshold concentration is reached for all analytes at the same time. The sensors constitute a novel application of biological materials in nanotechnology which is a rapidly emerging field of research for medical devices and environmental monitoring. The broader impact of the work is related to the development of novel RNA-based nanosensors whose function relies on the self-assembly from short oligonucleotides, triggered by analyte recognition. Students involved in the research gain broad and interdisciplinary training in areas of materials and device development for biological and medical applications. <br/><br/>This research develops sensors for biologically-active analytes based on modular RNA nanostructures that contain several copies of an aptamer which self-assemble to a signaling configuration in a cooperative response to ligand binding. By coupling sensor RNA assembly with multivalent cooperative ligand binding, sensing devices are created with nonlinear dose response over a wide dynamic range. The design concept for the sensors is based on previously developed self-assembling RNA nanostructures, including double-stranded RNAs in the shape of a square or triangle. The RNA nanosensors capitalize on two unique properties of RNA nanostructures: their modular design, which facilitates the rapid iterative optimization of sensor constructs for a variety of ligands, and their self-assembly from short oligonucleotides in an all-or-nothing process. The nanostructures design provides the basis for nonlinear cooperativity of ligand binding at multiple recognition sites. Modular design facilitates the design of a wide variety of RNA nanosensors with up to 4 ligand recognition sites within a single construct, allowing the design of AND-gated as well as OR-gated sensors.  The sensor signaling is dependent on either the simultaneous or exclusive presence of two different ligands. Self-assembly of the complete signaling-competent RNA nanosensor depends on ligand binding to all aptamer units and gives rise to cooperative recognition behavior of multiple binding sites. The novel RNA nanosensors are capable of nonlinear dose response over a wide dynamic range.  The research is performed by graduate and undergraduate students who are trained in a diverse array of technical skills including nucleic acid biochemistry, fluorescence assays, cloning, and biochemical in vitro assay development. The graduate students involved in the research gain a broad and interdisciplinary training, which renders the project ideally suited for the Chemical Biology graduate track at UCSD.  Professor Hermann continue outreach efforts by recruiting members of groups underrepresented in science through self-initiated and campus-supported programs and by outreach to local high schools."

These changes are expected to increase organic matter decomposition and release greenhouse gases. Plant growth may sequester carbon in terrestrial ecosystems via photosynthesis and mitigate releases to the atmosphere over short time-scales, but the ability of increased plant growth to offset soil carbon losses is complicated by soil nutrient availability. In particular, the critical nutrient phosphorus may become increasingly limiting to plant growth as demand exceeds current supply; however, non-biological controls on phosphorus bioavailability remain a major knowledge gap for northern peatlands. This research will investigate geochemical controls on phosphorus bioavailability in high-latitude soils to evaluate the potential for tundra and boreal ecosystems to act as future sinks for atmospheric greenhouse gasses. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with research training in a sensitive and dynamic ecosystem. The investigators and their students will also engage in community outreach by running an educational program on soils at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. They will use hands-on activities to teach K-6 students and their families about Arctic soils, soil diversity, and the importance of soil as a natural resource.<br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs will explore the hypothesis that phosphorus limitation at high-latitudes will be exacerbated by phosphorus adsorption to poorly-crystalline iron oxyhydroxides that rapidly precipitate during widespread drainage of iron-rich peatlands under changing hydrologic regimes. Phosphorus availability to plants is strongly regulated by hydrologic conditions due to redox-dependent interactions with iron oxyhydroxide minerals. Increases in iron-bound phosphorus in drying soils may lead to phosphorus limitation that constrains plant growth and limits carbon storage in plant biomass. The objective of this research is to integrate geochemical analyses (e.g., coupled iron and phosphorus extractions) with synchrotron-source spectroscopy to evaluate geochemical associations between iron and phosphorus across an experimentally-manipulated gradient of flooded to well-drained soils at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). Additional geochemical analysis of soils obtained from long-term observatories in tundra (e.g., Toolik Lake, Barrow Environmental Observatory) and boreal peatlands (e.g., Marcell Experimental Forest) will provide broader context for this study."

In a single molecular junction, perhaps the most elusive factor that influences the electron transport properties lies in the molecule-electrode contact interfaces. Despite continuous experimental achievements and the conceptual simplicity of molecular electronic devices, challenges for their theoretical understanding of the correlation between electron transport and molecular binding structures are still unresolved. Therefore, probing and controlling the structure and dynamics of single-molecule junctions and consequently controlling the molecular transport of these junctions are critical to the development of this field. The project will integrate molecular simulations for the self-assembly and nanocontact dynamics at surface and interface, and experimental mechanics and electron transport measurements of single-molecule junctions. The project will provide a deep understanding of many transition phenomena observed in molecular force and conductance measurements. If successful, the research will have tremendous impact on molecular electronics community and many other areas, such as energy research and molecular force spectroscopy. The education and outreach objective of this proposal is to tightly integrate the research efforts and results with graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education and to globally disseminate both research and the education outcomes.<br/>Technical:<br/>Although the electrical conductance and mechanical properties of single-molecule junctions have achieved significant progress over the past decade, challenges of a detailed understanding of molecular binding structures and electron transport, and the structure-force-conductance correlations, are still unresolved.

Multi-variable force-conductance two-dimensional cross-correlation histogram analyses for the force and conductance traces will be performed in experiments and simulations, and the distinct stable configurations of molecular junctions will be identified.

Various models for deposit formation relate the gold mineralization to different geologic events which likely occurred at different times, including magmatic activity, or circulation of groundwater-derived fluids through deeper gold-bearing units in the crust. Because of the lack of easily dateable minerals in CTGDs, it has historically been challenging to determine when gold mineralization occurred. The result is that effective exploration is hampered by the lack of knowledge about how and when these deposits formed. In this study, a new method of dating these deposits will be refined and tested. If the ages of CTGD formation could be more definitively known, gold mineralization could be correlated to broader geologic processes that were occurring at the same time. This knowledge would enable scientists and explorers to more easily discover new deposits.<br/><br/>Available geochronological data suggest that Carlin-type mineralization broadly overlapped in space and time with the southwest sweep of Eocene magmatism through Nevada. Geo- and thermochronologic datasets are critical to identify direct evidence that magmatism and ore formation overlapped at individual deposits. Indeed, new chronometric tools could greatly expand knowledge of the genetic processes that lead to CTGD formation. No straightforward method currently exists to date CTDG mineralization. Recent studies have explored the use of the (U-Th)/He chronometer for Fe-oxides, but this chronometer has not been systematically tested in ore deposits. The proposed research has two major goals: to test feasibility of the Fe-oxide (U-Th)/He chronometer to date hydrothermal fluid flow, and to use this method to determine the age of hydrothermal activity in a CTGD in Nevada."

This will be accomplished in two ways. First, the research will derive new analysis methods that experimentalists can use to interpret neural data from naturalistic tasks of moderate complexity. Second, by the project will create a broadly applicable computational framework for synthesizing these analyses into a theory of probabilistic neural computation. Both of these components are informed by three basic principles: information in the brain is distributed across many neurons, sensory evidence is weighted by its reliability, and neural computation occurs in multiple stages. Current analyses that connect animal behavior to neural activities apply to tasks that are so simple that an animal would not actually need a brain to solve them: the same computations could be accomplished in a single step by wiring the sensory organs directly to the muscles. Clearly there is a need to study more complex tasks that require multi-step computations, and the proposed research will provide the rigorous statistical foundation needed to analyze data from such studies. The research will also have a broader educational impact by creating interactive teaching games that explain concepts needed for thinking about big neuroscience data.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research program is to explain brain function by constructing quantitative theories of how distributed nonlinear neural computation implements principles of statistical reasoning. To accomplish this goal, this project will create a normative theory for what information about naturalistic tasks should be encoded in neural populations, and data analyses that can reveal which aspects of that information are actually decoded. The normative theory is based on probabilistic population codes, a model in which large-scale neural activity patterns encode not just estimates of a stimulus, but also the reliability of those estimates. This model is currently applied only to small-scale inference problems, and one aim of this project is to extend this model by constructing biologically plausible network models for complex naturalistic tasks involving many interacting variables. The key components of this model, and indeed of any model of naturalistic computation, are nonlinear operations. To determine whether the posited nonlinear computations occur in a real brain, the other aim of the project is to derive a statistical analysis technique centered on a novel generalization of standard choice-related activity, termed nonlinear choice correlation. By combining this measure with estimates of neural correlations, experimentalists will be able to infer the class of distributed nonlinear computations the brain uses from simultaneous recording of neural activity and animal behavior."

A well-chosen design facilitates the collection of data that, at a minimum cost, maximizes the information for the scientific questions of interest.  Many scientific studies allow for repeated use of conceptual units, so that developing tools for optimal design for these problems has great potential impact.  Particularly in the realm of big data, there is much room for improvement of existing methods for design of experiments, and the tools and concepts under development in this research project have potential to lead to significant gain of information without increasing computational cost.  Results from the project will be made available to researchers in other areas through easy-to-use software that implements the algorithms to be developed. Graduate students will be trained to become researchers in design of experiments. <br/><br/>This project aims to result in a major leap forward in understanding and knowledge of optimal design of experiments. Recent work in the field has had a significant impact on the advancement of optimal crossover designs and designs for interference models for arbitrarily given covariance structures and design size configurations. However, these results have for the most part been limited to approximate designs for relatively simple models. While these results are arguably important in their own right, this project will extend methods and tools to achieve the ultimate goal of deriving exact designs for a wider spectrum of practical models. The results will be a much needed addition to our collective design toolbox. Most importantly, this project will go beyond the territory of design and apply the tools and ideas from design of experiments to subsampling problems emerging in big data with both statistical and machine learning methods under consideration. Preliminary results indicate that this is an opportune time to make these challenging but critical steps."

Such devices could be a key component of a sustainable energy and chemicals future based on wind or solar energy.  The project will focus on synthesis of nanoparticle materials that have potential to improve the efficiency and stability of SOECs.  The proposed work addresses a fundamental stability problem in solid oxide electrochemical cells that is shared among a number of devices including solid oxide fuels cells operating in the reversible mode and certain batteries.  Thus, findings that will come out of the study can potentially benefit energy storage and conversion devices more broadly than SOECs alone.<br/><br/>SOECs typically operate at high electrode overpotentials, which in turn, can result in build up of effective oxygen pressure at the electrode-electrolyte interface, in some cases to the point of bubble formation.  The oxygen build-up can lead to internal cracking and electrode delamination.  Thi project is based on the proposition that nanostructured electrodes consisting of ionically-conducting particles electrode and electrolyte materials can substantially lower polarization resistance, lower oxygen pressure (and the risk of bubble formation), and thereby suppress degradation. To this end, nanostructured perovskite oxygen electrodes in the range of 10-50 nm will be deposited on electrolyte discs and fuel electrode supported cells by a variety of techniques, and then characterized for polarization resistance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.  The measured polarization resistance will be used in combination with microstructural analysis and calculations to predict degradation behavior that will be compared with experimental studies."

These infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on the global movement of goods and peoples. The global systems that deliver these resources, however, are inevitably funneled through bottlenecks or ""chokepoints"", such as canals, tunnels, maritime straights, border crossings, etc. Constricting the flow of materials and people, such chokepoints are both vital to national and economic interests, and uniquely vulnerable, dynamic, and prone to disturbances. Not surprisingly, governments, corporations, and communities have taken a keen interest in securing and regulating these sites. Little is known, however, about how these passageways actually work. This collaborative project seeks to explore how local communities, environments, and infrastructures interact to allow passage through these sites (or not), as well how ordinary (and sometimes extraordinary) events at chokepoints affect economic systems, security, and lives well beyond these points of passage.<br/><br/>Christopher Middleton and Gabriela Valdivia of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Carse of Vanderbilt University, Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Elizabeth Dunn of Indiana University, and Jason Cons of the University of Texas at Austin, will explore six chokepoints around the world. Each member of the team is an expert in their region of study. Each will focus on a particular kind of chokepoint. These include: the Panama Canal, a tunnel in Russia, a land bridge in India, an oil-refinery and pipelines in Ecuador, a network of rivers in Bangladesh, and a maritime strait leading into the Red Sea. The researchers will utilize extensive interviews, observation, and first-person engagement with officials, workers, and chokepoint residents in order to understand the distinctly human dimensions of these transit zones. Bringing together data from around the world, this study will provide a strategic reassessment of the global movement of goods, information, and people by examining these vital and dynamic points of national and world interest. The results will speak directly to current concerns over migration, security, and economic wellbeing.  In doing so, this project promises to alter the ways governments, industries, and others understand and engage with these critical transit points of the world today."

The new technology, called genome editing, can have a transformative impact on plant breeding and agriculture because it will be possible to introduce favorable genetic variants to increase yields and food quality. Genome editing techniques are based on a bacterial mechanism that is used for defense against infectious agents by changing their DNA. The great advantage of adapting this bacterial technique is that once fully developed, the technology will not leave foreign genes in the edited plant like previous technologies did. There are remaining challenges to the genome editing technique. However, this project will develop new methods to facilitate genome editing in plants. These methods make use of a group of cells in young plant parts that retain the potential to develop new organs, similar to the same property of animal stem cells. The research will test new ways of introducing the molecules that carry out genome editing in tomato stem cells. The high risk experiments will have a major impact on advancing the new genome editing technology.<br/><br/>This project will create a tomato transgenic line carrying both the Cas9 endonuclease and a conditional (lethal in the presence of a substrate) counter-selectable marker (CSM) driven by a shoot meristem-specific promoter. The latter represents a conditional and tissue-specific meristem suicide gene. A sgRNA targeting both the CSM and a gene of interest will be delivered to young stems by Agrobacterium-mediated infection of CSM-transgenic tomato seedlings. Expression of the sgRNA in the meristem will lead to inactivation of both CSM and target genes. The injected plants will then be decapitated at the inoculation site to induce new shoot regeneration. The CSM will be expressed exclusively in shoot apical meristems. Thus, application of the selective substrate will lead to meristem death in non-mutated regenerating meristems, but will allow the stem of the plant to continue support of newly formed, target-edited, and substrate-resistant shoots. This approach can significantly expedite genome editing at an unprecedented rate, and in addition can make genome editing a reality for crop species that are recalcitrant to transformation and regeneration with traditional methodologies."

This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for addressing some of the major challenges in this area.

The main difficulty arises from the delicate role that history plays in the definition of these solutions. This project will continue the development of new methods for analyzing this and other quasi-static problems, based on higher order energy approximations using history at only a finite number of prior times. Dynamic Griffith fracture is also very delicate, due to complex interactions between elastic singularities and the (a priori unknown) evolving crack set. New methods based on blow-up techniques will be developed for analyzing these evolutions."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and are the subject of this investigation. This research will involve the work of undergraduate students at an RUI. <br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on three related neutrino experiments: MINERvA, Nova and MINOS+, all measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions is required. This award will be used to measure (using the MINERvA detector) these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away) experiments as well as the current Nova experiment. The work on the MINOS+ experiment will help map out the shape of the energy dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability, which could reveal new anomalies in the neutrino sector. A number of BSM proposed phenomena, from sterile neutrinos to extra dimensions, can cause measurable deviations in the neutrino oscillation probability in the 4-10GeV range.<br/>A special contribution of this award and an exciting broader impact of this research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by scientists."

Environmental filtering posits that environmental conditions allow species with certain traits to establish and persist, causing species traits to cluster. Alternatively, limiting similarity is the idea that species with similar traits will competitively exclude each other, producing an assemblage with an overdispersion of traits. Trait dispersion patterns are used to determine the importance of these scale-dependent, niche-based (i.e., biological, chemical, and physical factors in the environment) processes in structuring assemblages relative to neutral processes. The search for general patterns of these processes has been hindered by several factors including: lack of large-scale studies, inconsistent and erroneous methodologies, and changes in CAP along environmental gradients and species richness. Convergent evolution of functional groups within independent zoogeographic regions would provide additional evidence for ecological mechanisms influencing assemblage structure. A major challenge for ecology is to understand how assemblages are functionally structured and how CAP, at varying spatial scales, influence biodiversity patterns.  <br/><br/>This dissertation research project has three aims that address these issues: (1) examine knowledge gaps regarding functional diversity and convergence patterns of fish assemblages at a global scale; (2) determine relative contribution of limiting similarity and environmental filtering to neutral processes at three scales using recently proposed analytical methods; and (3) assess changes in functional diversity and community assemblage processes across environment and species richness gradients. Understanding the relative role of niche-based and stochastic processes at various scales is a central goal in community ecology and crucial for not only conservation and management of assemblages but for understanding the effect of the ever-changing environment on communities as a whole. To effectively address these aims, fish assemblages will be sampled in forty wadable streams in five different zoogeographic regions of varying species richness. Traits with well-known relationships to trophic ecology, habitat use, and life history will be measured for each assemblage. The relative contribution of community assembly processes will be tested at three spatial scales using new methods for analysis of functional trait dispersion. Functional diversity indices will be compared across gradients of stream size and species richness. Lastly, patterns of convergence of functional structure and community assembly processes in different zoogeographic systems will be analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. Field research will involve collaborations with scientists and students from several countries."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Rena M. Schweizer is ""Adaptation to High Altitude and Evolution of Metabolic Pathways in Deer Mice."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Montana, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Zachary Cheviron. <br/><br/>This research uses deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model species to pursue questions about how animals adapt to high altitude, a question that has long been of interest to biologists. Insights from this work will serve as a basis for new theories of adaptive evolution, which can be tested with other animal species. The survival of mice depends on their performance at different altitudes, and genetic patterns indicate natural selection among populations living at different altitudes. Differentiation of the hemoglobin molecule (which animals use to absorb oxygen) in red blood cells between low- and high-altitude populations of deer mice is a well-studied case of genomic and physiological adaptation. The process of how oxygen is subsequently transported through the animal?s tissues is one example of a metabolic network. The Fellow?s research examines the metabolic networks that control multiple physical traits involved in how deer mice adapt to high altitude, in order to describe genetic patterns that are important to adaptation. Methods include sequencing to assess genetic variation of all genes within each of several candidate metabolic pathways, precise physiological measurements of multiple traits that affect aerobic performance in a lab colony of deer mice, and sampling wild deer mouse populations to assess whether the identified genes are under natural selection. The results will shed light on the genetic basis of physiological adaptations to high altitude and will help characterize how gene evolution is affected by metabolic pathway position. <br/><br/>Training objectives include collecting and analyzing multiple high-throughput sequencing data types, learning protocols for handling small mammals, and measuring complex physiological processes. To increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups, the fellow is coordinating with the Indigenous Research & STEM Education at the University of Montana to bring in local learners -  including grade school students as well as undergraduates - by communicating and teaching science. Additional activities include the initiation of a ""Lunch with a Scientist"" program, creating hands-on demonstrations in the field, writing non-technical articles, and creating an informative multimedia website on the project."

As such DNA methylation plays a vital role in many biological processes. There are many instances in which DNA methylation between samples is different.  Examples are: 1) different organs (liver vs brain), 2) health vs disease (cancer exhibits methylation patterns that are different from those of healthy tissue), and 3) environmental responses (plants that endure heat and drought stress).  These differences are known as differential methylation. Recently, technology has been developed to simultaneously query the millions of methylation sites in DNA.  This technology, however, creates computational and statistical challenges. A pressing question in the field of biology is how to analyze the massive amount of data generated in this way so as to draw biologically relevant, and statistically sound conclusions, without requiring expensive computing equipment. The output of this project will provide statistical methods for detecting differential methylation. This information can then be used by specialists to understand cell function, develop therapeutic interventions, or tackle questions associated with environment such as climate change.  Freely available statistical tools that can be used by all scientists interested in analyzing differential methylation will be developed. This interdisciplinary research project between the mathematical and biological sciences also supports the training of students in these fields. <br/><br/>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that directs gene expression and chromatin conformation. The most common form of DNA methylation in vertebrates is an addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base that is directly followed by a guanine, which is referred to as a CpG site. There are approximately 30 million CpG sites in the human genome with an even larger combination of states of methylation.  A differentially methylated region is a region in the genome where mean methylation levels of CpGs are different between two sample groups, such as disease versus normal. Bisulfite sequencing methods are typically used for measuring DNA methylation at CpG sites. Expansion of this technology to permit simultaneous query of all CpG sites, known as whole genome bisulfite sequencing, has created computational and statistical challenges. These include improving the capability to distinguish signals from noise  in very large datasets, a current focus of much modern statistics. The project team will develop statistical methods to detect differential methylation between sample groups. Specifically, the methods in this research project improve existing approaches by recognizing and accounting for correlations among methylation sites based on their genomic locations. Such model assumptions ensure that statistical results are biologically meaningful and interpretable. In addition, the methods will borrow information across the whole genome to improve estimation and statistical testing reliability. Bayesian models with theoretical justifications will be developed and implemented using efficient and scalable algorithms to ensure their applicability to a wide variety of high-throughput methylation datasets. Methods will be implemented into software tools and will be freely available for biology and statistics researchers."

How the evolutionary contingencies of adaptation, diversification, and dispersal interact with possible ecological limits on the niche space of different environments will be investigated.  The taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of whole biomes and clades will be quantified in order to model niche evolution and biome shifts at extensive geographic and temporal scales.  Whether evolutionary biome shifts are systematically associated with changes in functional traits or niche hypervolumes will be examined.  Whether or not the functional niche space of biomes becomes saturated over evolutionary time, and if saturation reflects ecological limits on diversification through physiology, will be tested.

Plant roots provide the major input of soil carbon, transferring carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere into the soil system. Microorganisms in the soil are the primary consumers and decomposers of this carbon, and can transform it back into carbon dioxide, or into methane. It follows that the part of the soil where microorganisms come in contact with plant roots is a hotspot for carbon transformation. This graduate student research research project will follow the fate of root-derived carbon in soil, examining the role of soil microbial communities and associated soil minerals in carbon stabilization. The project will involve collaboration with scientists at national laboratories and promote participation of students from under-represented groups in the research. <br/><br/>While carbon (C) association with soil minerals is thought to be a critical step in soil C stabilization, the underlying mechanisms - particularly in the persistence of mineral-carbon associations - are poorly understood. The student will grow the common annual grass, Avena barbata, (wild oat) under a 13CO2 atmosphere in soil microcosms, thus enabling her to follow the fate of the root-derived C. Using a technique called stable isotope probing (SIP), she will trace the 13C derived from the plant into soil microbes and on to soil minerals. In this project, the researchers will investigate how the longer term fate of C, present on minerals or in soil microorganisms is effected by the presence or absence of A. barbata. The research will examine (1) the fate of mineral-associated C, (2) the influence of mineralogy, (3) the influence of the rhizosphere, the zone of plant root influence, and (4) the role of the microbial community. By constraining both the mechanisms of mineral-C association and persistence, the researchers can begin to understand and quantify the importance of these associations in C cycling and environmental change models."

Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising interdisciplinary scholar at the intersection of neuroscience, developmental sciences and education. As children enter their teenage years and progress through middle school, they often show decreased motivation to learn. How to motivate these students and engage them in learning is a crucial but often-neglected problem facing educators. This problem is especially crucial as teens must increasingly learn to make their own decisions. Positive and negative feedback, such as praise and criticism, can serve as a powerful tool for educators, clinicians, and parents to promote learning; however, its effectiveness can be highly dependent upon how motivated the child is to learn. There are many changes in the teen brain to support learning during this crucial developmental period, including the maturation of different brain regions involved in motivation, reward processing, and self-control. These changes may make teens uniquely sensitive to positive and negative feedback during learning. Furthermore, these brain changes may also increase teens' sensitivity to motivating or demotivating aspects of their learning environment; for example, teens may be more sensitive than adults to whether a learning task is presented as a measure of their abilities versus an opportunity to practice new skills. The goal of this project is to bridge brain science, education, and psychology to uncover how interactions between the developing brain, the learning environment, and individual differences influence motivation and learning. Research in the burgeoning field of educational neuroscience has begun to investigate how learning new skills or information influences the brain; this project will take the reverse approach, by investigating how changes in the developing brain influence the ability to learn, both in the lab and in school. This project will advance the field of adolescent neurobiology and will illuminate opportunities to improve educational practice by tapping into the unique sensitivities of the developing teen brain. The findings will also pave the way for a new approach to educational neuroscience, in which neurobiological changes in the developing brain can help to inform pedagogical approaches.<br/><br/>This project will bridge disparate literatures to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying adolescent learning, and will set the stage for future investigations of educational strategies to enhance adolescent learning. Because the striatum plays a critical role in reinforcement learning, its peaking sensitivity during adolescence may help to scaffold learning from performance-related feedback. Feedback is an important tool educators use to guide learning, so it is important to understand how ontogenetic changes in the adolescent brain influence the ability to learn from feedback. For this project, we will utilize complementary methodologies (fMRI and physiological measurements of skin conductance), and cutting-edge effective connectivity analyses (dynamic causal modeling) to understand how interactive networks contribute to learning across different developmental stages. Using these tools, in conjunction with contextual manipulations of motivation, measurement of individual achievement goals, and teacher reports of academic performance, the proposed study will aim to (1) characterize behavioral and neural responses to feedback during learning in early to mid-adolescence relative to adults, (2) investigate contextual effects on the motivational salience and learning efficacy of positive and negative feedback during adolescence, and (3) examine the link between neural responses during learning in the laboratory and educational outcomes in school. In this study, a sample of ethnically diverse teens and adults will undergo brain scans while performing a task that assesses their behavioral and neural responses to positive and negative feedback. The proposed research will address a gap in the literature by elucidating the role of the corticostriatal reward system in facilitating learning during this important developmental stage. Through this project, we will determine how the dynamics of the developing adolescent corticostriatal system mediate contextual motivational effects on feedback-based learning and help to illuminate the relevance of developmental neuroscience for academic achievement and educational practices outside of the laboratory."

One-carbon compounds, including carbon dioxide and methane, are attractive alternative feedstocks for liquid fuel and chemicals production, because utilization of these abundant feedstocks can upgrade these low-value materials and at the same time lower greenhouse gas emissions.  Photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae can use carbon dioxide to make fuels, and other microorganisms can metabolize methane, but not very efficiently.  A more fundamental and efficient framework for metabolism of one-carbon compounds, designed at the molecular level from the bottom up, is needed to enable a viable biological process.  The goal of this project is to use the tools of synthetic biology to engineer microorganisms to convert single carbon compounds, including carbon dioxide and methane, directly into a variety of chemicals and fuels.  The educational activities associated with the project include the hosting and mentoring of Hispanic middle and high school students from the Houston Harmony Science in the laboratory of the principal investigator.<br/><br/>The research will develop a new metabolic platform for the assimilation of single carbon compounds, including carbon dioxide or methane, directly into the production of organic chemicals and fuels within genetically engineered microorganisms.  The proposed engineered platform defines a new metabolic architecture that consolidates carbon fixation, central metabolism, and product synthesis into a single pathway.  The pathway uses formyl-CoA as a single carbon extension unit, which bypasses the need for the production of common metabolic intermediates and allows for elongation of a carbon backbone iteratively in single-carbon increments. The proposed platform is inspired by the catabolic alpha-oxidation pathway, and uses the enzyme hydroxyl-acyl-CoA lyase to catalyze C-C bond formation between formyl-CoA and an aldehyde.  The engineered platform consists of three modules, including an activation module that converts a single carbon molecule to an extender unit, an elongation module in which the extender unit is added to a carbon backbone, and a termination module, which converts intermediates of the elongation module to target products.  There are four research objectives to develop this pathway.  The first objective is to rationally design a pathway allowing for the iterative elongation of a carbon backbone using 1-carbon extender unit formyl-CoA and the synthesis of longer-chain products from the intermediates of this pathway.  The second objective involves the in vitro characterization of pathway components and functional assembly of individual modules using molecular and biochemical techniques.  The third objective focuses on the in vivo construction and characterization of the pathway to achieve product synthesis via microbial fermentations, and the fourth objective focuses on a system-wide characterization of wild-type and engineered strains.  Toward this end, functional components for each enzymatic step will be assembled in vivo by making use of synthetic biology tools to facilitate the efficient conversion of single carbon feedstocks to valuable products via microbial fermentation.   The new C-C bond formation mechanism advanced by this research will be expected to make fundamental and potentially impactful contributions to one-carbon metabolism and biosynthesis."

The workshop will also explicitly address the integration of current and best practices in the area into the education of the future workforce. The benefits of this workshop are germane to the strengthening of a critical infrastructure, i.e., the grid, and the preparation of an educated workforce.<br/><br/>The goal and scope of this workshop includes the exchange of information on best practices, current trends, and topics for future research and education in the application of CPS technologies to power and energy systems. The physical and cyber security of the future electricity grid of the future is paramount. The future grid is also expected to be powered by cleaner sources of generation than in the past, such as renewable energy source that may exhibit inherent stochasticity. It is imperative to develop tools and techniques for assessing the impact of these new technologies on the power grid. The wide acceptance of academic research in these areas is dependent on the validation of the results using realistic environments. One of the enablers for conducting such validation studies and presenting highly reliable results to the industry is the use of testbeds. Lastly, all of the above themes relate to the preparation of a highly-trained workforce that will face the challenges of operating and managing the complex grid of the future."

The laser is already integrated into our daily life: Among their many applications, lasers are used in optical disk drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners; fiber-optic and free-space optical communication; laser surgery and skin treatments; cutting and welding materials; military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed; and laser lighting displays in entertainment.   <br/>The laser produces bright, coherent, and tightly-focused light beams which consist of lots of photons (individual constituents of light). When measuring the arrival times of the photons in a laser beam using a photo-dector, the photons arrive randomly. Researchers have discovered that if the arrival times of photons can be orchestrated, these photons could have novel applications in quantum computing and communications that are not possible by using conventional lasers. A light beam that consists of these orchestrated photons is called non-classical light. Scientists have demonstrated the existence of the non-classical light. Nonetheless, to date there exist no efficient methods to produce bright non-classical light. The major hurdle is that although the scientists can coordinate a handful photons, it is very challenging to coordinate a large number of photons in a batch.<br/>The project aims to research a quantum light source for generating bright non-classical light. Specifically, we will design a quantum light source, and develop a computational framework to control and to manipulate the photons generated by the light source. Once completed, this project will make possible a new type of quantum light sources such that the output light of the quantum light sources will consist of  a large number of coordinated photons so that their arrival times at the photo-detector can be controlled. Such a new quantum light source will be important for practical applications in quantum information science. The capabilities for controlling quantum state of light are of paramount importance for modern society. The success of the project will represent important breakthroughs in quantum optical information processing, a field that has already broadly impacted modern technology and human life.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The capability of on-chip  generation of a large flux of entangled quantum photonic states (antibunched or bunched entangled photons) is necessary to meet the growing demands of a broad range of next-generation scientific and technological applications. Among these are quantum optical information processing, such as  quantum computing and quantum key distribution, and quantum (or ghost) imaging. In bunched states, the photons always arrive together at the photo-detector; while in the antibunched states, the photons never arrive together. A promising solid-state route to engineer the quantum photonic states is to use the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems that relies on the anharmonicity of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction. The PI has shown that the geometry currently employed in experiments - a single Jaynes-Cummings (JC) component sandwiched by two waveguides - have a fundamental tradeoff between high converting efficiency (from independent photons to entangled photons) and the quality of the quantum states (degree of entanglement), and  is sensitive to dissipation. Furthermore, the short lifetime of a single JC component severely limits the efficient generation of the quantum photonic states. It is desirable to have high-throughput quantum light sources; however, direct scaling up the number of the cavity QED components would not work, as the photons generated from different cavity QED component would intervene with each other at the output to wash out the intra-state correlations. The goal of this proposal is to computationally research high-throughput quantum photonic sources that produce high-quality entangled quantum photonic states to push the generation of the quantum photonic states well beyond the state-of-the-art."

This project takes advantage of planned dam removals that will connect fish populations that have been separated for nearly four centuries, in order to study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of secondary contact between these recently divergent fish populations, which may interbreed but also may compete. Results from this work will contribute to the conservation and management of migratory alewife fish, a critical resource in coastal freshwater and marine habitats and the focus of intensive restoration and conservation efforts. Researchers will work collaboratively with state managers, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, lake associations, and land trusts to determine the consequences of restoring migratory populations, provide information vital to alewife recovery, and educate local communities on the consequences of river restoration. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher along with graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary project that relies on advanced genetics techniques, field sampling, and manipulative field and laboratory experiments. An existing program at Yale University will support involvement of underrepresented minority undergraduate students in summer research. Training will include the broader scientific context of the research, research methods, data analysis, written and oral project reports, and direct involvement with the public to present the societal benefits of the research. <br/><br/>This project takes advantage of whole-lake restoration projects to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of secondary contact between recently diverged lineages of alewife. Isolation caused by construction of dams has resulted in two divergent alewife life history forms: the ancestral anadromous form that moves between lakes and the coastal ocean and a landlocked form that is resident in lakes. This project will combine advanced genomics, small-scale experiments, and whole-lake observations and experiments to document and understand the consequences of secondary contact, when dam removal allows reintroduction of anadromous alewife into lakes that contain the land-locked form. Close collaboration with the state agency that removes dams will allow the investigators to study secondary contact from its initiation. The project addresses three stages in response to secondary contact: rapid ecological change in planktonic communities and nutrient flux, rapid evolutionary responses in invertebrate populations in response to novel ecological conditions, and interactions between the two alewife morphs that may result in hybridization and, over the longer-term, alewife evolution and local adaptation. The first of these responses - ecological changes in lacustrine communities - is essential in order to interpret the evolutionary changes that result. The project is unique in its ability to capture the consequences of secondary contact on both time scales. Results will provide rare insight into feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in field populations following secondary contact with important implications for ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity in restored ecosystems."

One arm of the rift extends from Lake Superior to Oklahoma and the other through central Michigan to perhaps as far south as Alabama. Where exposed in the Lake Superior (or Keweenaw) region, surface observations and geophysical data indicate that the rift basin is filled with flood basalts, which are unusual landforms whose formation can have a devastating influence on climate and life. Most flood basalts around the world occur in so-called Large Igneous Provinces in which rapid eruption of a large volume of basaltic magma, created by deeper mantle processes (mantle plumes), flows great distances over existing topography to form a thick stack of lava flows. However, flood basalts of the Mid-Continent Rift depart significantly from this norm, occupying a relatively small space and erupted significant volumes for about 20 million years. These characteristics are difficult to explain solely through the traditional mechanisms proposed for the generation of flood basalts. This project explores the idea that the Mid-Continent Rift formed as a combination of rifting and interaction with deeper a mantle plume thus having characteristics of both a rift and a Large Igneous Province. Besides forming a fundamental structure of the North American continent, the Mid-continent Rift hosts important copper ore deposits in the Lake Superior region. The project would advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved STEM education and educator development through development of teaching modules and workshops for formal and informal educators; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through continuation of ongoing place-based outreach in national and state parks; and (3) development of a competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate students and by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In contrast to typical rifts that are filled with a mixture of clastic sediments, volcanoclastics, and lava flows, the 3000-km Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift is filled with flood basalt with thicknesses that exceed even most large igneous provinces. These observations can be resolved by considering the Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift as a hybrid rift and mantle plume-generated large igneous province. In this model, the volcanics were deposited during an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a post-rift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding sag basin without associated faulting. This project addresses the question of how the rift and plume interacted, including the possibility of lengthy interaction between an initially distant plume via material flow at the base of the lithosphere. Specifically, the project will use major and trace element analysis, isotopic characterization (Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf), and argon geochronology of rift basalts to determine: (1) the geochemical signatures of the source reservoirs contributing to the basalts and their change over time; and (2) the temperatures, pressures, and source composition(s) of melt generation. The project employs a 2D parallel primitive variable particle-in-cell finite-difference method to study the behavior and melt formation of rifting under Precambrian mantle conditions in the absence or presence of a plume and geodynamic modeling to constrain the extent of lateral migration of plume material under Precambrian mantle conditions coupled with a model for melting and melt extraction. Rifting history is determined from the cusp in the apparent polar wander path and microplate kinematics from gravity modeling."

A critical need for growing yam economically is to develop low-cost plant growth systems that permit production and breeding of yam crops that are free from disease, resistant to stress and highly productive. Costs of breeding must be minimal for shareholder farmers to ensure food security. This research project is developing the low-cost methods to generate disease-free yam tubers, which are the underground edible stems that can also serve as starting material for continued propagation. The project is developing an efficient and improved bioreactor, or vessel, that will enable proliferation of ""starter"" yams from non-seed tissue, such as leaves, stems or flowers. By hormonal and nutrient manipulation in the bioreactor, the project will develop inexpensive methods to propagate disease-free and stress-resistant strains of yams. The project collaborates with the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture in Kenya to reduce costs for shareholder farmers by improving bioreactor technology. In the process, undergraduate students will be trained and educated in advanced breeding methods. Web-based resources  and multimedia efforts will help educate the public, other researchers and farmers. The project includes direct involvement of researchers in Africa and direct educational programs with smallholder farmers. <br/><br/>Temporary immersion bioreactor (TIB) systems will be developed utilizing open-source and inexpensive technology to generate plants as inexpensively as possible in a format that can be translated into relatively low-technology implementation environments. The specific focus on Dioscorea (yam) species provides a target plant species that has important economic impact on countries such as Nigeria where it is an important food source and cash crop to smallholder farmers. Since tissue culture methods of yam are minimally developed, the work will include other plant species such as Musa (banana) and cassava, which have efficient regeneration systems in place, while further developing tissue culture methods for yam. Recent advances in TIB systems have demonstrated the ability to inexpensively control the composition of the liquid as well as the gas phase. Therefore, a focus of the research is to utilize this control to improve the rates of plant production.  Genomics and bioinformatics have made it possible to quickly identify embryogenic proteins. These proteins will be produced by expression in bacteria, and then tested for ability to improve embryogenesis in yam and more generally in plants. A web resource will be generated to facilitate collaboration that identifies people, methods and literature as well as provide a forum for disseminating the results of the research through videos, instructions, etc.  The project will culminate with a workshop held in Africa to engage and educate yam stakeholders with a focus on providing education to farmers and others to take advantage of the open technology that has been developed."

At a high level, harmonic analysis can be described as the theory of using a particular mathematical tool, the Fourier transform, for detecting, analyzing, and representing patterns in large data sets.  Applying it in the context of Boolean functions refers to the case where the data comes from 0s and 1s, the basic building blocks in computer science.  Harmonic analysis of Boolean functions has proven to be a powerful tool in computer science, with application to theories of machine learning, error-correcting codes, cryptography, privacy, optimization algorithms, and distributed computing.  Part of the aim of this project is to further develop the mathematical and computer science foundations of harmonic analysis of Boolean functions.  Another aim of the project is to expand its scope to include further applications in the field of quantum computation.  If and when quantum computers are built, it is known that they will be able to break cryptographic codes that are secure today; this is fundamentally due to their ability to efficiently perform Fourier transforms on huge data sets.  However the full potential power of quantum computation is not well understood, and building quantum computers remains a major engineering challenge.  The project will investigate these issues, analyzing the advantages of quantum computers over classical ones, and understanding how to more efficiently test components of quantum computers. A final key outcome of the project will be scientific and educational training for computer science graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as wide dissemination of the research produced.<br/><br/>            At a more technical level, the project has several major-stretch-goals that will be used to guide the research in harmonic analysis of Boolean functions.  Included among these are conjectures of Aaronson and Ambainis concerning the influence of variables on low-degree Boolean functions, and on the decision tree complexity of checking correlation of a function with its Fourier transform.  Proofs of these conjectures would yield new complexity results delimiting the power of quantum computation versus classical computation.  Another major technical goal of the project is to develop the theory of learning and testing an unknown quantum state."

Often Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are used to facilitate this information through aerial mapping of terrain, or by locating victims and potential hazards not immediately known to first responders in the field. Recently, multirotor UAS have been considered for use in manipulation and grasping tasks in the field. The inclusion of a robotic arm in the design greatly increases their utility in practice, and allows these machines to interact with their environments mid-flight. These interactions may be as simple as water sample collection or as complex as door opening, and while there are many advantages to the deployment of a UAS to perform these tasks, there are still many problems concerning stability in operation. The proposed work seeks to improve the effectiveness of these manipulation UAS through the design and analysis of a mechanism which would actively balance the platform while flying. Work concerning the design and implementation of the mechanism will be conducted at the Intelligent Robotics & Mechatronics System (IRMS) Laboratory of Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea under the supervision of Professor Hyouk Ryeol Choi. The expertise of the IRMS Laboratory in manipulation platforms is an invaluable resource for the completion of this award, and this collaboration will lay the groundwork for future works between Sungkyunkwan University and the University of Nevada Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Aerial manipulation using a multirotor UAS is challenging due to the limitations imposed on the platform?s stability by multirotor actuation modes. Indeed, a traditional multirotor is incapable of producing a couple to negate applied external torque. To maintain hover conditions during manipulation maneuvers, the design and implementation of a balancing mechanism will be explored to affect active stabilization of the platform. While the effects of the environment on the mounted manipulator?s end effector cannot be accounted for generally, the eccentricities introduced to the system?s center of gravity by the mass and moment of inertia of the manipulator can be reduced using the mechanism. It can be shown that this improves robustness of both static and dynamic flight, through analyses based on Lyapunov?s principles, simulation, and testing. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

One promising direction is utilizing atomically thin materials because of their flexibility and high electron mobility.  Graphene was the first such material identified in this new area of two-dimensional (2D) materials.  Unfortunately, graphene is not a semiconductor, but a semimetal and is therefore not suitable for the digital logic circuits widely used today in electronics.  Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of 2D materials which share many of the promising aspects of graphene such as being atomically thin.  In addition, they exhibit a wider variety of electronic and optoelectronic properties compared to graphene including many being semiconducting or metallic.  This wide range of transition metal dichalcogenides allows one to select a material or a combination of materials best suited for a particular application.  Indeed, by combining different 2D materials together in vertical heterostructures an even wider range of new device functionalities can be enabled.  This collaborative research program will create new educational and research opportunities at both the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program will strongly emphasize the training of graduate and undergraduate students from underserved groups, thus preparing them for industrial or academic careers. This workforce training, along with the expected research output, will boost the efforts to make our nation more competitive.<br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this collaborative research program is to study layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials and heterostructures for device applications, using a combination of controlled heterostructure fabrication techniques, scanning probe microscopy, and electrical transport measurements.  Similar to graphene, the most widely studied two-dimensional material, transition metal dichalcogenides represent a larger class of layered materials with varying electronic properties, from semiconducting to superconducting. The diverse set of electronic properties in these materials makes them suitable for applications ranging from transistors to chemical sensors or photodetectors. Key to an understanding of their fundamental electronic properties is the role of the disorder potential, interfaces, and edges in individual layers, and of the band and rotational alignment in heterostructures.  Specifically, the proposed effort will (1) measure band-alignment in transition metal dichalcogenide based heterostructures, (2) realize heterostructures of two-dimensional materials with controlled rotational alignment, (3) explore the impact of rotational alignment on the electronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures, and using these ingredients (4) design and fabricate novel heterostructure tunneling devices.  This program builds on the PIs existing collaborative research and recent preliminary data on the fabrication and characterization of these heterostructures.

Consequently, the Input/Output (I/O) pipelines for large scientific data analysis can be long and complex because they comprise many ""stages"" of analytics across different layers of the I/O stack of high-performance computing systems. Performance limitations at any I/O layer can cause an I/O bottleneck resulting in longer than expected end-to-end I/O latency. In this project, PI aims to implement a novel data management infrastructure called Software-defined Storage Resource Enclaves (SIREN) at system levels to enforce end-to-end policies that dictate an I/O pipeline's performance. The cross-cutting nature of the technologies developed in the project can help large scientific data analytics leverage the full capability of memory and storage devices on supercomputers. The project will facilitate the development of a graduate level data-intensive computing course at Washington State University Vancouver, and contribute to the education of undergraduate, female, and under-representative students.  Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The technical objectives of the project are three-fold. First, SIREN aims to allow administrators to set allocations for enclaves to manage a group of applications that belong to the same I/O pipeline. Second, it intends to enforce I/O policies (e.g., proportional sharing) at more than one layer of I/O stacks simultaneously considering characteristics of storage devices (e.g., disparity of read/write capacity for SSDs and performance sensitivity to data locality for disks) to achieve optimal performance. Third, PI aims to solve storage-specific implementation issues, including design of user-friendly interfaces, enclave naming and resolution, metadata management, failure handling, and admission control. The introduction of SIREN can fundamentally change the execution model of data staging services widely used on supercomputers. It will also contribute to the understanding of performance characteristics of I/O pipelines under external I/O interference during data staging."

This disease includes symptoms such as frequent and painful urination, penile inflammation, increased risk of urinary tract infection, and complications such as renal failure if not treated early enough. Existing options for patients with urethral strictures fall into two buckets: effective but invasive and complex open surgery (urethroplasty), and minimally invasive procedures (dilation, urethrotomy, or self-catheterization) with subpar outcomes. Patients typically begin with a minimally invasive treatment such as dilation or urethrotomy (stretching or cutting of the scar tissue), with a high chance of stricture recurrence. Patients often choose to repeat such treatments despite the short duration of effectiveness with their frontline urologist, rather than undergo the surgical procedure, which is performed by a trained reconstructive urologist. This I-Corps team, uCure, is developing TAURUS, a system to empower urologists to restore patient quality of life by replicating effectiveness and durability of urethroplasty, minimally invasively. This aims to offer a more desirable approach to reduce recurrences for patients, and making a financially incentivized treatment accessible to a wide range of urologists, resulting in cost effectiveness to payers and the health care system as a whole.<br/><br/>uCure?s TAURUS facilitates the transurethral delivery of a graft, to widen the urethra at the site of stricture. The proposed project is in the proof of concept stage, iterating on early feasibility prototypes, and performing bench and preliminary animal tests in both post-mortem and live rabbits. This team has had discussions both with potential users, but also urologists across the globe who have attempted transurethral urethroplasty, mostly in the 1990s, but failed to gain adoption due to the complexity of the attempted procedures. Advances in multi-channel small lumen manufacturing and endoscopes now open the door to developing feasible, accessible, user-friendly devices for widespread commercial adoption. Through the I-Corps program, the proposed project benefits from technical and clinical de-risking, while swiftly iterating on solution design. The team is currently in discussion with 3rd party manufacturing resources to transform its proof of concept prototypes into alpha prototypes at scale for use in its animal studies. The team is   planning to demonstrate early stage functional prototypes of the proposed TAURUS system at the end of the I-Corps program."

The Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and strong evidence for dark matter, inferred from astronomical observations. This project will involve performing precise measurements of differences in behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state.  In addition to these fundamental research goals, the funding for this research program enables the training of the next generations of scientists and engineers at all levels, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers working at the frontier of particle physics research with the state of the art data analysis and computing techniques, electronics instrumentations and particle and radiation detection techniques.<br/><br/>This research is carried out with the LHCb particle detector at the LHC collider at the CERN laboratory.  The specific focus of the research is on studies of reactions involving particles that contain the bottom quark or the charm quark.

The findings, together with expected results from experiments at the energy frontier, could help uncover new laws of nature and point the way to the structure of new physics beyond the Standard Model.  The research program also involves the upgrade of the LHCb detector, which is required for operations at higher luminosity of the LHC collider.  The detector upgrade effort is focused on the design of electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip tracking system located just upstream of the LHCb magnet."

Although modifying the ""business as usual"" dispatching protocol would likely result in higher direct costs to consumers, this project will analyze the benefits that could result in achieving air, water, and climate improvements and how this strategy compares in cost to other mitigation strategies. The proposed strategy is targeted to determine the best power plant fleet to meet demand reliably, while minimizing environmental and social consequences.  <br/><br/>The societal impact of this research is potentially far-reaching, offering an innovative mathematical framework that may reduce the social and environmental costs of power generation without new power infrastructure investments.

This project's broader significance and importance is that it aims to simplify the parallel programming of an important class of applications that includes physical simulations, such as battle-field simulations, and analysis of graphs, such as social networks. The intellectual merit is that the abstractions and systems software needed to parallelize these applications efficiently on multicore processors goes well beyond the state of the art, and if successful, will lead to a significant improvement in our understanding of how multicore parallel computers can be exploited effectively.  <br/><br/>Traditionally programmers have relied upon an abstraction called Task Dependence Graph for exposing parallelism in applications. However, dependence graphs cannot be used for emerging applications such as discrete-event simulation of physical systems, e.g., colliding particles and modeling of deforming materials using asynchronous variational integrators. Parallelization of such applications is very challenging because of the complex behaviors exhibited by tasks in such applications: for example, tasks may <br/>create new tasks which must be executed before existing tasks due to ordering constraints based on simulation-time causality, and the execution of one task may change the dependences between existing tasks. The key insight behind the project is that a data structure called the Kinetic Dependence Graph (KDG) can be used to track dependencies in such applications, permitting safe parallel execution at the cost of some book-keeping expense to maintain the KDG. The programming constructs and systems implementations developed by the project will be released publicly as part of the Galois system from the University of Texas at Austin."

A leading idea is that fault rocks have to weaken during the earliest stages of the earthquake; otherwise, fault slip stops and large earthquakes would not occur.  If such ""dynamic weakening"" occurs, we should see evidence for it within rocks from fault zones that have experienced earthquakes.  This project is studying rocks from the San Andreas Fault zone to uncover traces of dynamic weakening from earthquakes, and to understand what conditions might lead to such weakening.  The results from this work will enable improved models of the hazards posed by large earthquakes.  In addition, this project is educating students in a wide range of earthquake geology and fault rock topics via hands-on research experience, and communicating fundamental earthquake geology and physics, scientific drilling, and coring to broader audiences via social media, videos, and in-person presentations.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/><br/>The PI team is using field observations and samples from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) core and the Cajon Pass drill core, combined with new and previous field and drill core samples of the San Andreas Fault, to elucidate evidence for thermally activated dynamic weakening mechanisms in large seismogenic faults.  The team seeks evidence for these mechanisms in samples that may preserve the texture and composition of slip weakening at depth. <br/><br/>The team is evaluating the distribution of these mechanisms across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and testing how well exhumed faults represent faults at depth. The team is integrating optical and scanning electron microscopy with detailed X-Ray diffraction mineralogy, micro-scale whole-rock geochemistry, and stable isotope analyses.  The PIs are examining slip surfaces with Laser Raman microthermometric spectroscopy on fluid inclusions to determine fluid compositions and temperatures in veins, and with Raman and X-ray Near Edge Spectroscopy to investigate potentially new indicators of thermally driven elemental changes of carbon, iron, and manganese on the faults. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include: 1) Educating students in a range of earthquake geology and fault rock petrological topics, ultimately adding uniquely trained technical researchers to the STEM workforce; and 2) Increasing awareness of fundamental earthquake geology and physics, scientific drilling, and coring to broader audiences through the use of engaging hands-on activities, class exercises, videos, and social media platforms."

The theory of computation has proven invaluable in enabling information processing in electronic man-made systems, and much-studied algorithms underlie the behavior of everything from communication networks to video games.

Further, understanding how information processing is possible in the disordered world of chemistry could result in error-robust electronic computing. The project will also contribute to the development of undergraduate and graduate courses, which will train students to apply the principles of computer science and electrical engineering in traditionally incompatible domains. This will encourage the next generation of scientists to break through traditional disciplinary barriers and create the scientific and engineering fields of tomorrow. <br/><br/>This proposal will answer foundational questions about the computational power of chemical kinetics (chemical reaction networks). How can chemicals be programmed to have desired behaviors? How much molecular energy does such computation consume? How much ""more computation"" does every additional chemical reaction enable?

This proposal will help precisely delineate the capabilities and limitations of this technology, resulting in smaller, simpler DNA-based circuits. This proposal also introduces a new paradigm, based on the laws of thermodynamics, for programming DNA-DNA interactions. As chemical and biological systems are comprised of molecules that are inherently information-rich and programmable, principles of computer science will help design smart molecules."

One arm of the rift extends from Lake Superior to Oklahoma and the other through central Michigan to perhaps as far south as Alabama. Where exposed in the Lake Superior (or Keweenaw) region, surface observations and geophysical data indicate that the rift basin is filled with flood basalts, which are unusual landforms whose formation can have a devastating influence on climate and life. Most flood basalts around the world occur in so-called Large Igneous Provinces in which rapid eruption of a large volume of basaltic magma, created by deeper mantle processes (mantle plumes), flows great distances over existing topography to form a thick stack of lava flows. However, flood basalts of the Mid-Continent Rift depart significantly from this norm, occupying a relatively small space and erupted significant volumes for about 20 million years. These characteristics are difficult to explain solely through the traditional mechanisms proposed for the generation of flood basalts. This project explores the idea that the Mid-Continent Rift formed as a combination of rifting and interaction with deeper a mantle plume thus having characteristics of both a rift and a Large Igneous Province. Besides forming a fundamental structure of the North American continent, the Mid-continent Rift hosts important copper ore deposits in the Lake Superior region. The project would advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved STEM education and educator development through development of teaching modules and workshops for formal and informal educators; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through continuation of ongoing place-based outreach in national and state parks; and (3) development of a competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate students and by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In contrast to typical rifts that are filled with a mixture of clastic sediments, volcanoclastics, and lava flows, the 3000-km Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift is filled with flood basalt with thicknesses that exceed even most large igneous provinces. These observations can be resolved by considering the Midcontinent/Keweenaw Rift as a hybrid rift and mantle plume-generated large igneous province. In this model, the volcanics were deposited during an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a fault-controlled extending basin, and a post-rift phase where volcanics and sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding sag basin without associated faulting. This project addresses the question of how the rift and plume interacted, including the possibility of lengthy interaction between an initially distant plume via material flow at the base of the lithosphere. Specifically, the project will use major and trace element analysis, isotopic characterization (Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf), and argon geochronology of rift basalts to determine: (1) the geochemical signatures of the source reservoirs contributing to the basalts and their change over time; and (2) the temperatures, pressures, and source composition(s) of melt generation. The project employs a 2D parallel primitive variable particle-in-cell finite-difference method to study the behavior and melt formation of rifting under Precambrian mantle conditions in the absence or presence of a plume and geodynamic modeling to constrain the extent of lateral migration of plume material under Precambrian mantle conditions coupled with a model for melting and melt extraction. Rifting history is determined from the cusp in the apparent polar wander path and microplate kinematics from gravity modeling."

Cells actively transport cargo in membrane enclosed sacs between different regions of the cell and to the cellular periphery and back. This is accomplished in large part by teams of molecular motors that can attach to the cargo and use chemical energy to power mechanical motion along a road network that is an assembly of protein filaments called the cytoskeleton. Remarkably, while intracellular transport is typically robust, it occurs in an extremely hostile environment where cargo undergo constant collisions from surrounding molecules and the cytoskeletal networks continually change in time. This project will produce a comprehensive mathematical model of intracellular transport that integrates features at the level of single molecular motors, teams of motors and also at the level of the cytoskeleton which spans the cell.  This model will provide understanding of how cells maintain robust transport in highly noisy environments and will also help ascertain how the parameters governing transport can be tuned for minimizing variability and promoting efficient transport. Since intracellular transport is essential for cellular function and its breakdown can lead to multiple neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases, results from this project can potentially  inform the optimal design of drug and gene delivery systems as well as therapeutic interventions to repair transport. This project will also produce new teaching and training materials and aid in their dissemination to the local community colleges in the historically underserved and economically disadvantaged California Central Valley region. This project is also aimed at providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>At the cellular scale, motion is governed by molecular-level events and is inherently stochastic. In addition, the environment in which the transport takes place is typically structurally complex as well as dynamic, either due to thermal noise or via regulation by the cell itself. Intracellular transport of cargo between different cell organelles and to the surface and back, occurs by a combination of diffusion and active motor-driven transport along the cytoskeleton which is a hierarchically assembled, oriented, interconnected network of multiple filament types that are inherently dynamic. While there has been considerable work addressing the mechanistic details of molecular motors, much less is known about actual transport properties in naturally occurring complex and dynamic settings.  Current approaches to transport at a large scale usually sweep molecular details into effective parameters though it is becoming clear that collective transport can sensitively depend on these details. Furthermore, in virtually all cases, the explicit structure and dynamics of the cytoskeletal network is ignored. This project takes a multi-scale approach that incorporates the various microscopic processes at the level of a single motor, the mesoscopic properties of collections of motors and the macroscopic features of the cytoskeletal network which all conspire to give rise to robust transport.  This work will provide fundamental insight into the role of microscopic stochastic motion and environmental dynamics on experimental observations of in vivo transport. The project results will also help  with  ascertaining what regions of parameter/design space are best for minimizing variability and promoting efficient transport. This project's results are therefore likely to have a significant impact on the optimal design and control of transport processes for general application in therapeutics and biotechnology."

Increasingly the LLVM virtual instruction set (developed by the principal investigator under prior NSF funding) is being used by various industries. A serious problem with this model is that application developers are unable to test the final computer code that is generated for their applications: they are only able to test the virtual code.<br/><br/>This project is developing new techniques that allow application developers to have much higher confidence in the final code for applications that ship as virtual code.  The basic approach, called ""translation validation,"" allows the translation process from virtual to machine code to also generate a formal proof that the machine code preserves all the correct behaviors of the virtual code, and does not introduce any unexpected incorrect behaviors.  Unlike existing work on translation validation, this work can generate proofs for translation between two very different languages, as well as formal guarantees in the presence of possible incorrect behaviors in the virtual code.  Besides these reliability benefits, the strategy also improves the security of software because virtual code is widely used today as a means to enforce security requirements of important systems, e.g., Web browsers, operating systems, and database systems.  Such systems rely on correct translations of virtual code to machine code to enforce security, and formally verified translations will prevent security vulnerabilities that might otherwise be introduced by bugs in complex (and so, inherently bug-prone) translators."

Specifically, the PIs will (1) determine dominance relationships and identify likely dispersers via regular behavioral observation; (2) fit GPS radio collars to 25 pre-dispersal females and chart their movements on an hourly basis; (3) measure immunocompetence (parasite burden and immune response) and hormone concentrations (androgens and glucocorticoids) in (a) fecal samples (collected prior to, over the course of, and following dispersal) and (b) serum samples (collected pre-dispersal and post-settlement); and (4) evaluate the health and survival of these females in their newly formed groups."

While these materials provide a platform to address a myriad of theoretical problems in physics, because of their unique properties TIs can be exploited to produce interesting devices as well. The main focus of the project is to investigate the unique properties of TIs, paying close attention to uncovering the interplay between their surface and bulk states. Specifically, one of the main objectives is to establish a fundamental understanding of how to separate the contributions from surface and bulk states to the overall conductivity of the material. Additionally, magnetically doped TI samples are analyzed to interrogate the interplay between magnetism and various properties TIs. This project primarily uses an optical investigation technique known as spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine the contributions from the surface and the bulk states of TI samples. Additionally, temperature dependent experiments are conducted in order to uncover the intricate details that govern the physics of TIs.  The work is performed exclusively by undergraduate students in a liberal arts setting. These students receive training in materials characterization, optics, and cryogenics, preparing them for graduate studies or careers in science and technology.  To further educational goals, this project incorporates several high-impact experimental activities into existing courses in the physics curriculum. Furthermore, several outreach activities for high school students are conducted in order to foster a wider interest in the sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Because of strong spin-orbit coupling and time reversal invariant symmetry, a new class of materials, called topological insulators (TIs), are embedded with unique characteristics; it has an energy gap in the bulk but has metallic surface states that are robust against disorder-scattering. Although there has been a concerted effort made towards understanding the physics of TIs in the past few years, there are several key aspects that are still unknown; a) the interplay between the bulk and the surface states in dictating the conductivity of TIs, b) the impact of impurity bands on TIs, c) interplay between topologically protected states and magnetism, and d) the significance of electron-phonon coupling on topologically protected surface states. Insights gained about any of these aspects will enable a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics of TIs, which is the ultimate goal of the project. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the complex conductivity in a wide spectra range (i.e., between 30 meV to 6.2 eV), which enables one to decipher the contributions from free carriers and band electrons to conductivity. Temperature dependent measurements are conducted to probe the electron-phonon coupling in TIs, which plays a vital role in influencing the surface states. Since TIs are plagued by defects, which unfortunately mask the exciting and intriguing surface phenomena, the details of defect-states are obtained by evaluating the higher-order transitions (i.e., critical points). The magnetically-doped TIs are probed to determine the origin of their magnetism and to study the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Finally, the spin texture of TIs are probed via their circular dichroism, obtained by Mueller-Matrix based spectroscopic ellipsometry.  This project incorporates several activities to enhance  educational goals in the sciences. As the work is performed exclusively by undergraduate students in a liberal arts setting, they receive training in materials characterization, optics, and cryogenics, preparing them for graduate studies or careers in STEM-based fields.  In addition, this project injects several high-impact experimental activities into existing courses in the physics curriculum. Also, several outreach activities for high school students are conducted in order to foster a wider interest in the sciences."

Understanding human impacts on plant communities on island ecosystems is important because islands are often hotspots of biodiversity. This project seeks to determine the effects of urban proximity on plant species composition and diversity. The research will be conducted primarily on Ulleung Island, a small, isolated volcanic island in South Korea and will focus on understory vegetation. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Seung-Chul Kim of Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea. Dr. Kim studies genetic relationships among plant groups, and has extensive experience conducting phylogentic and population studies on Ulleung Island. <br/><br/>Ulleung Island, Gyeongsanbukdo, South Korea, also known as Ulleungdo, is approximately 72.9 sq km in area and hosts 685 plant taxa, including 41 taxa of rare plants and 30 taxa of endemic plants. The high biodiversity of the island makes it an excellent candidate for ecological study. In particular, studying human proximity impacts on biodiversity on Ulleungdo can illuminate the influence of anthropogenic activity from the local population and tourists on ecologically diverse temperate island ecosystems. The project involves sampling understory vegetation in deciduous, mixed, and coniferous canopy forests of varying distances from urban influence. The collected data will serve as the baseline for future study of change over time due to direct human influence (e.g. habitat disruption and exotic species introduction) and indirect human influence (e.g. altered environmental factors due to climate change). In working with Doctor Seung-Chul Kim, this project will link vegetative community research with ongoing phylogenetic research to create a more complete picture of Ulleungdo's unique flora and ecology.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports the summer research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded jointly by the National Science Foundation and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Such a collapse would have a potentially devastating effect on the ability of the magnetic field to shield us from cosmic ray bombardment, placing our electrical grid at grave risk, among other things.  The probability of such a drastic event happening depends on the average strength of the magnetic field.  If the average is approximately equal to the present field (as many researchers assume), then the fact that the field is dropping rapidly would be more alarming than if the magnetic field is quite a bit higher than average, as implied by the current data for the ancient magnetic field from Antarctica.  The argument over the average field strength stems from the difficulty of its estimation.  The new approach advocated for in this proposal will allow researchers to obtain a robust data set for high southerly latitudes which will greatly enhance confidence in estimates of the average ancient field strength, contributing to our ability to assess the likelihood of catastrophic collapse of the geomagnetic field.  <br/><br/>The difficulty in estimating the average magnetic field strength over the past five million years is apparent when one examines data for ancient field strength as a function of latitude.  Directions of the geomagnetic field have been well approximated by an axial dipole (bar magnetic) at the center of the Earth that is aligned with the spin axis. But the signal of such an axial geomagnetic dipole, whereby the field strength doubles from the equator to the poles, is not readily apparent in the database of field strength estimates from the last five million years.  There are several possible explanations for this troubling failure: 1) combining data from different ages with possibly different average intensities leads to an inappropriate comparison of field states, 2) there is a depression of field strength at high latitude, perhaps reflecting the role of the  `tangent cylinder?, or 3) there is noise and/or bias introduced by poor selection criteria or poor experimental design.  The latter is a likely explanation as published data from the 1960 lava flow on Hawaii display the entire range of intensity values observed on the Earth's surface today, yet samples from this lava flow should all have one distinct value.  This proposal benefits from the development of new experimental methods, better field strategies and a new approach to data selection that will allow accurate estimation of the ancient field strength through a comprehensive field campaign to collect lava flow samples from previously studied outcrops targeting the most promising material.  These will be analyzed using the most robust experimental protocol and subjected to rigorous selection criteria proven to reject inaccurate results, leading to both accurate and precise estimates of ancient field strength."

One promising means of overcoming data overload is through the introduction of multimodal displays which distribute information across various sensory channels (including vision, audition, and touch).  In recent years, touch has received more attention as a means to offload the overburdened visual and auditory channels, but much remains to be discovered in this modality.  Tactons, or tactile icons/displays, are structured, abstract messages that can be used to communicate information in the absence of vision.  However, the effectiveness of tactons may be compromised if their design does not take into account that complex systems depend on the coordinated activities of a team.  The PI's goal in this project is to establish a research program that will explore adaptive collaborative tactons as a means to support situational awareness, that is the ability of a team to perceive and comprehend information from the environment and predict future events in real time.  Project outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of perception and attention between and across sensory channels for individuals and teams, and to how multimodal interfaces can support teamwork in data-rich domains.<br/><br/>The work will integrate three disparate topics within human factors: multimodal interfaces, situational awareness, and adaptive systems.   The PI will create methods to design tactons that take into account both context and the types of information needed by a team, by leveraging the multimodal aspects to develop quantitative and qualitative models and algorithms using physiological measures (in particular, eye tracking data).  These in turn will inform the functionality of adaptive tactons that support collaboration by adjusting the presentation of information in response to various sensed parameters and conditions."

The recently discovered Higgs boson is an excitation of a Higgs field that permeates all of space and gives mass to the other fundamental particles in the Universe.  Other fields, such as those that carry the electromagnetic and nuclear forces, interact with this Higgs field, and studying these interactions gives important insight into the properties of the Higgs field.  Ironically the interaction of gravity - the force we are most familiar with in our daily life - with the Higgs is hardly understood at all, due to the vast difference in strength between gravity and the other known forces.  The Higgs field may also interact with the mysterious material which gravitationally binds our galaxy together, and other as yet undiscovered constituents of nature. The CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider functions as the world's most powerful and sophisticated camera, observing collisions of protons at the highest energies humanity has yet achieved; recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.  The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations.<br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several projects at the cutting edge of hadron collider physics with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the energy frontier.  They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including service as co-conveners of major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector construction and operations.  They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas and a rich program of physics analyses and interpretations has originated from their efforts.  They plan to continue this innovation and leadership to further improve the capabilities of the detector and data analyses.  As the CMS detector ages, upgrades will need to be designed and implemented. This award will allow the Rutgers group to create an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as helping test and install the electronics for the hadron calorimeter.  They are also performing R&D work on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger.  They plan to host a production and testing facility for the upgrades. The Rutgers group hosts a large number of outreach activities which have a broad impact on the community.  Through the Rutgers QuarkNet program they run summer workshops at Rutgers for high-school teachers and students.  Students and teachers from across New Jersey analyze LHC data and build cosmic-ray telescopes.  They mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students.  These students work closely with the group's students and postdocs and contribute to ongoing studies and analyses. To combat the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women, and working to increase the participation of women in science.  They are active in promoting particle physics programs in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. After feedback from high school physics teachers, they are developing instructional programs for New Jersey high school physics teachers who need help teaching university-level physics courses. They are initiating outreach to the broader community with the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey to prepare particle physics related exhibits.  They continue to convey the excitement of particle physics with frequent talks at local high schools, libraries, and other venues."

This objective addresses the growing need for continued miniaturization of sensors in applications such as medical testing, water and food quality monitoring, and security inspection. Moreover, such small-size sensors will enable their integration into existing and developing technologies, e.g., wearable electronics. To accomplish the objective of the proposed research fundamental science and engineering research is required. Thin film¡Vbased microcavity organic light emitting diodes (mcOLEDs) will be used as optical excitation sources; they will be integrated with hybrid, perovskite-based photodetectors (PDs). The mcOLEDs will be fabricated combinatorially on a single substrate, providing narrow emission bands (full width half max FWHM~20 nm). The emission peaks, produced by different active materials and microcavity dimensions, will range from the red to the near UV. The uniform dense array of such mcOLEDs, yet unachieved, will be integrated with two types of highly responsive perovskite PDs (an approach not yet explored): those responsive over a broad spectral range and those responsive over a narrow range. Bio/chem analytes will be monitored in two modes of operation, measuring analyte-induced changes in the (i) PL intensity using narrow-band PDs and (ii) PL decay time using both PD types. Developing both approaches will enhance selectivity and specificity. Importantly, to enable the advantageous PL monitoring where viable, the mcOLEDs and PDs will be evaluated and optimized to shorten the pulsed electroluminescence (EL) decay time and the PDs¡¦ response time by fundamental studies of their relation to materials, charge mobility, layer structures and thickness, defects, and device design. The integrated compact sensors will be demonstrated for two array types: (i) those operated by monitoring PL for, e.g., O2, dissolved O2, glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and ethanol, and (2) those operated largely by monitoring IPL as in e.g., pH measurement and immunoassays, which are of biological and health monitoring importance. The approaches outlined in this proposal will pave the way to miniaturized analytical tools on flexible substrates, integrated with microfluidic architectures. Array designs, attribute optimization, the demonstrated applications, and initial exploration of flexible devices are expected to significantly advance the fields of organic and hybrid electronics and analytical methodologies."

Adaptation to different environments is important for generating biological diversity, and for fish, environmental salinity is a major factor limiting where they can live. Adaptation to different salinities is therefore thought to have been critical in the generation of the amazing biodiversity of fishes. However little is known about the genetic and physiological changes that enable species to adapt to different salinities. The Atlantic killifish mainly occupies marine habitats, but some populations have recently moved into fresh water. The freshwater populations provide an ideal study system for discovering the genetic changes that have enabled life in a fresh water environment. This research is important because it will shed light on the types of evolutionary changes that have permitted this species, and perhaps many species, to colonize new environments resulting in the biodiversity of the fishes.

In addition, the research will provide material in college preparatory mentorship of disadvantaged youth through the AggieMentors program at UC Davis. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research is to identify the genetic loci that are associated with tolerance of low salinity. Admixture mapping is a method that takes advantage of natural hybridization between genetically and phenotypically distinct populations in order to determine the loci that influence a particular phenotypic trait. Admixture mapping will be applied to two replicate hybrid zones: one within the Chesapeake Bay consisting of a freshwater native and a brackish water native population, and the other along the east coast where a northern and southern population are both marine. Sampling in these zones will provide genetically similar populations that experience vastly different selective pressures. It is therefore possible to disentangle the effects of genetic ancestry versus the effects of selection on the fitness of fish adapted to low salinity environments. Parental populations and their hybrids will be tested for low salinity tolerance and genotyped using restriction site associated genetic markers. Admixture mapping will identify loci contributing to the specific phenotypes. Genome-wide analysis will identify loci that are under selection only in the freshwater environment. This combination will not only allow for the identification of phenotypes involved in general salinity tolerance, but also will reveal those loci driving recent adaptation to fresh water."

Turbulence in a magnetized plasma is the primary mechanism responsible for transforming energy at large injection scales into small-scale motions, which are ultimately dissipated as heat in systems such as the solar corona and wind.  In this regard,  the main purpose of this 3-year SHINE project is to improve present understanding of plasma heating and distribution function dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas using both hybrid and fully kinetic, continuum Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. <br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project aims to accomplish the following three science objectives.  The first objective is to develop a better understanding of the distribution function dynamics related to wave damping in fully non-linear turbulence.  The second objective is to examine the behavior of Alfvenic turbulence near the proton scale.  The third objective is to determine the relative importance of proton and electron heating in large-scale intermittent structures produced as a natural consequence of turbulence.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the nature of turbulence in space and astrophysical plasmas.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.  <br/><br/>The research outcome of this project may have implications for weakly collisional fusion experiments, and it could provide additional insight into a myriad of heliospheric domains, and be of interest to the astrophysics community.  The parameters chosen and the continuum nature of the simulations will provide valuable particle distribution function information for existing and upcoming spacecraft missions, such as Solar Probe Plus.  The knowledge gained from this project will aid in the development of improved models of energy transport, which may aid in global modeling of many disparate, large-scale phenomena.  The full simulation data from the final stage of the project will be made available to the community to analyze and compare directly to available spacecraft data.  Additionally, the simulation code, Gkeyll, and associated analysis scripts are openly available for community use.  The project will support a graduate student at the University of Maryland College Park.  Additionally, underrepresented undergraduate students from mid-Atlantic minority-serving institutions will be involved in the research through the Graduate Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics (GRAD-MAP) program during their annual winter workshops.

The southern U.S. near the Gulf Coast and the eastern U.S. bordering the Atlantic experienced two cycles of super-continent formation and break-up.  These episodes of collision and rifting altered the crust and mantle lithosphere of the North American plate, thickening these layers in some regions, thinning them in others, and producing distinctive structures by aligning mineral grains and melting small amounts of rock.  In this project we will use earthquake waves to construct three-dimensional models of the crust and mantle lithosphere, and we will interpret these models to better understand how continental collision and rifting affect continental lithosphere.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to improve resolution of crust and mantle structure in the southern and eastern U.S. in order to better understand lithospheric evolution and modification through the last Wilson cycle. The southern and eastern margins of the North America continent experienced two complete Wilson cycles of orogeny and rifting, leaving varied signatures of deformation and magmatism in the crust and mantle lithosphere of these regions.  However, many aspects of crust and mantle structure remain poorly known at the scales relevant to distinguishing the effects of orogeny, rifting, and other processes such as hotspot interaction.  Using data from the NSF EarthScope USArray/Transportable Array (TA), now completed in the contiguous U.S., we propose to image crust and mantle seismic structure in new detail.  We will focus on two regions: one spanning the southern craton edge, the entire Ouachita orogeny and the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, and the other containing the eastern craton edge, the central and northern Appalachians, and the Atlantic coast.  We will use seismic data from TA stations, supplemented by other temporary and permanent broadband stations, to image crustal and mantle discontinuities using Sp and Ps receiver functions, construct 3-D anisotropic models based on Rayleigh wave, Love wave and shear-wave-splitting analyses, and we will integrate these data and methods through joint analyses and inversions.  The seismic models will be used constrain the style and geometry of deformation in the crust and mantle lithosphere due to the last episodes of orogeny and rifting.  This interpretation will be guided by geological and active source indicators of deformation in the shallow crust and by the type and age of magmatism across the region, bearing in mind that some facets of crust and mantle structure may reflect events that predated or followed the last cycle of orogeny and continental rifting.  Variations in the impact of orogeny and rifting on the lithosphere will be compared between and within the study regions. The proposed project will support the education and career development of graduate students at the University of Houston and at Brown. It will also contribute to undergraduate senior theses, lab exercises and group research projects in undergraduate and graduate courses, and to science outreach activities with local public schools.  Students from diverse backgrounds will be recruited to participate in this research. <br/>"

Medical devices such as implantable insulin pumps, which are in wide use today, continuously monitor and manage a patient's diabetes without the need for frequent daily patient interventions.  These devices, not originally designed against cyber security threats, must now mitigate these threats. This project examines security vulnerabilities in these implantable medical device systems and offers new insights and understanding to protect these devices and prevent their misuse by users and abuse by hackers.<br/><br/>Specifically, this research addresses how to detect and defend against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks between the glucose sensor and the insulin pump or monitor device held by patients. Detection of such an attack is addressed via a personalized model to calculate and recognize abnormal glucose levels. To remotely secure the dosage setting over a wireless link, a bio-key based on personalized parameters unique to each patient with diabetes mellitus, is used.  Authentication is carried out via an acoustic-based fingerprint scheme coupled with voice pattern recognition technology. A mixed acoustic and radio wave-based secure channel in an artificial pancreas is being developed to test and validate this approach. While this project focuses on glucose sensors and insulin pumps, these security schemes can be applied broadly to other wireless medical devices. This project is being carried out at Delaware State University, a historically black college or university, and leverages collaborations with the University of Pennsylvania and University of Alabama to design a secure wireless insulin pumping system, and will support diverse undergraduate and graduate students for two years. The research results will also be used to design and implement course materials on cyber-physical systems security and will help train students to become tomorrow's cyber security professionals."

Solar cells for producing electricity require materials that absorb the sun's energy and convert its photons to electrons, a process called photovoltaics.   Recently, materials based on inorganic-organic halide perovskite materials have achieved promising solar energy power conversion efficiency approaching that of silicon solar cells, and can be made from earth-abundant elements using lower-cost, solution based fabrication methods.  However, present organic-inorganic perovskite photovoltaic devices chemically degrade during long-term service under both high sunlight and moisture in air. Furthermore, present methods for their fabrication result in the inconsistent performance of the final device. The goal of this project is to develop new fabrication methods to improve the environmental stability and performance reproducibility of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices to help enable their future practical use.  A unique aspect of this project is that the research will be carried out as part of a formal international collaboration between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States and the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel.  Both institutions bring unique and complimentary research expertise as well as opportunities for student training. <br/><br/>The research plan will seek to improve environmental stability and fabrication reproducibility of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices through four material fabrication strategies: 1) introduce molecular species with specialized functionality into the active layer, 2) adjust film formation kinetics, 3) tune the chemical composition of photoactive films, and 4) add passivating agents that reduce charge trap densities.  These strategies will be investigated within the context of three research objectives. The first objective is to develop a fundamental understanding the origin of the grain-to grain variability in electronic properties of methylammonium lead triiodide.  The second objective is to elucidate the origin of non-radiative decay in the microscale emission.  As part of this objective, the crystallographic structure and composition will be correlated to characteristic luminescence emission and electronic properties at the microscale.  The third objective is to determine the factors limiting the reproducibility and environmental stability of methylammonium lead triiodide, with particular focus on identifying the mechanisms responsible for photovoltaic deterioration that limits operational device stability under concentrated sunlight."

Under certain mixture and temperature conditions, auto-ignition will occur.  Systems such as diesel engines and high-speed scramjets/ramjets rely on auto-ignition for achieving ignition and flame stabilization.  Other systems, including gas-turbine and spark-ignition engines are designed to prevent auto-ignition to avoid significant and/or catastrophic damage.  For either of these scenarios it is highly desired to understand the physics governing the transient auto-ignition process.  Turbulent flows are very complex and when coupled to the chemical reactions governing auto-ignition, a highly dynamic system is formed where turbulent mixing has a direct effect on the reaction chemistry.  In this project, time-resolved measurements of fuel/oxidizer mixing, temperature, and species will be made using advanced laser diagnostics, characterizing the flow and chemical conditions necessary for achieving auto-ignition kernel formation under turbulent fuel injection.  The impact of the research will be far-reaching, ranging from a new physical understanding of auto-ignition dynamics to assessing numerical simulations and models.  This project also will aid in the training of a graduate student and mentoring of a post-doctoral researcher.  In addition, a unique aspect of this project is the implementation of a formal direct graduate-to-undergraduate mentoring program, where a graduate student is partnered with and mentors an undergraduate honors student.  The PI also will partner with a local elementary school for K-12 outreach, equipping young students with information, inspiration, and initiative in STEM-related topics.  The overarching topics, such as combustion, engines, and lasers, provide exciting themes for younger children and can help build the foundation for a life-long interest in science and technology.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will be transformative in the fact that the dynamic coupling between turbulent mixing, low-temperature chemistry and ?hot? ignition kernel formation will be examined in detail for the first time.  High-speed (10 to 100 kHz acquisition rate) laser diagnostics will be used to measure the mixture fraction, temperature, and CH2O/OH concentrations following turbulent fuel injection through auto-ignition.  Specific research contributions include quantification of key time-dependent processes which lead to the observed auto-ignition topology including the mechanisms in with turbulent mixing modifies auto-ignition topology and the role of low-temperature chemistry (e.g., CH2O) on ignition kernel formation. Due to the transient and spatially-intermittent nature of the auto-ignition process, multi-dimensional, temporal records are necessary to characterize the flow field scalars at the ignition kernel sites.  These measurements will be used to determine space-time correlations between mixture fraction, CH2O (low-temperature chemistry) and OH (hot ignition kernel) as well develop new statistics of the mixture fraction, temperature, and scalar dissipation conditioned on the ignition kernel location for parameterization of the most probable conditions leading to auto-ignition.  The proposed measurements will be carried out across a broad range of test conditions, examining the effects of varying Reynolds (Damköhler) number, fuel type, and oxidizer composition and temperature."

A major challenge for working with species with duplicated genomes is that the extra gene copies make it extremely difficult to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. The goal of this project is to develop and apply new statistical tools that take advantage of modern DNA sequencing technologies to enable the study of polyploid organisms. These tools will then be used to study patterns of hybridization and whole genome duplication in a complex group of polyploids in beardtongues, plants from the genus Penstemon. In addition to providing opportunities for graduate student training in laboratory and bioinformatics techniques, this project will produce and freely distribute software code for use by evolutionary biologists. <br/><br/>Although polyploidy has played an important role in the history of many eukaryotic lineages, there are few tools for studying and understanding their genetic history at contemporary timescales. Two of the main reasons for this are (1) ambiguous genotypes due to uncertainty in allele copy number and (2) complex patterns of allelic inheritance that can vary at different loci across the genome. The proposed work addresses these issues by developing a statistical framework to infer inheritance patterns from high throughput sequencing data while simultaneously accounting for genotype uncertainty. It will develop a model that will then be used to test hypotheses regarding the origins of the allohexaploid Penstemon attenuatus species complex, which contains four regional varieties each with different putative parental species. Double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing will be employed to gather genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data for the model, and hypotheses of allopolyploid origin will be evaluated using tests for introgression. The statistical model will facilitate the study of polyploidy in other non-model organisms."

This project seeks to understand the importance of this water for plants and soil microorganisms. This metabolic water is potentially of vital importance when external water supply is low. The project will test the idea that metabolic water is important to plants in withstanding drought and repairing drought-induced damage to the plant water transport system. The project will also test the idea that metabolic water provides a means for soil microbes to sustain activity in dry soils. The project will employ novel techniques based on providing a tracer for metabolic water via a chemically distinct form of oxygen that allows distinguishing metabolic water from water that is not produced by metabolism.  The techniques developed in this study to monitor metabolism in complex living tissues have potential applications for studying mitochondrial disorders underlying human disease and cancer detection.  Undergraduate students will be active participants in the research, receiving training in microbial and plant ecology, and respiratory metabolism.  <br/><br/>Metabolic water is produced during respiratory metabolism in animals, plants, and aerobic microorganisms.  Although its vital importance is well recognized in some animals, virtually nothing is known about the physiological or ecological significance of metabolic water in microorganisms and plants. The project hypothesizes that metabolic water contributes importantly to the water balance of soil microorganisms, prolonging activity in drying soils by providing an internal source of water that slows desiccation and delays the onset of dormancy.  For plants, it's hypothesized that metabolic water contributes to the recovery of water transport function in embolized vascular cells by providing a local source of water under positive pressure that contributes to refilling of embolized cells. To test these hypotheses, the project uses a suite of innovative observations, experiments, and modeling activities. A key experimental methodology involves incubations in air containing oxygen gas enriched in the stable isotope of oxygen, 18-O, resulting in 18-O enriched metabolic water that can be distinguished from environmental water by its distinctive isotopic composition.  The 18-O studies are augmented with two cutting-edge imaging techniques: high-resolution x-ray computed tomography to visualize refilling of embolized vessels, and stable isotope Raman spectroscopy to locate 18-O labeled metabolic water within cells and tissues. New insights from these studies will be transformational in terms of understanding the interaction of central energy metabolism and water relations in plants and microorganisms."

On average 2 volcanoes are in a state of eruption every year. Volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Cook Inlet are capable of sudden, explosive, ash-cloud forming eruptions, which are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight aircraft along this heavily travelled air corridor. Many of Alaska?s volcanoes are in remote locations with harsh environments. Monitoring these volcanoes represents a formidable challenge and many of the volcanoes are not instrumented. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below the 20 Hz hearing threshold of the human ear) is a rapidly developing technology to understand and monitor explosive volcanic eruptions. Modest-sized explosive eruptions produce powerful infrasound signals that propagate efficiently over thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. However, to date, these signals have been recorded by sparse infrasound sensor networks, limiting our understanding of their source generation and propagation through the atmosphere. The EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) is currently being deployed in Alaska, bringing the densest ever combined seismic and infrasonic network to one of the world?s most active volcanic regions. Exploiting this novel dataset, this project will advance the capability of acoustic early warning systems of volcanic eruptions for aviation safety and will assess the potential contribution of large sensor networks such as the TA to volcano monitoring. At the end of the project, an operational volcano-acoustic monitoring system resulting from this work will be implemented at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.<br/><br/>This work will capitalize on the unprecedented seismo-acoustic dataset starting to become available as the TA records Alaska?s routine explosive volcanism with dense spatial wavefield sampling. Volcano seismo-acoustics is a rapidly advancing research field, where basic questions remain on the source mechanisms, source directionality, atmospheric propagation, and seismo-acoustic coupling from explosive volcanic eruptions. This project will focus on detection, discrimination, and location of the signals using novel methods; quantifying the seismo-acoustic wavefield; investigating the source mechanisms; quantifying seismo-acoustic wave coupling; and understanding infrasound propagation in the spatio-temporally varying atmosphere. Through a combination of data analysis and modeling, we will characterize and quantify diverse seismic and infrasonic signals recorded at a range of distances and directions from the explosive eruption source. We will address the following questions: (1) How do observed acoustic and seismic signals from explosive volcanic eruptions vary with distance and azimuth to the source? (2) How does acoustic propagation differ for various types of explosive eruptions? (3) What kind of volcanic source information can be determined from long-range seismo-acoustic data? (4) What are the wavefield sampling limitations in previous volcano infrasound studies? (5) What other infrasound sources are present in Alaska? Our team will work with the EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to help highlight this research and its impacts. Multi-media products illustrating seismo-acoustic wavefields from volcanic eruptions in Alaska will be distributed via the web for use in public information packets and education and outreach. Event catalogs and related data products will be publically available, with notable infrasound events uploaded to the IRIS TA Infrasound Reference Event Database (TAIRED).<br/>"

Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability). Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region."

The project also will train four interns (undergraduate and graduate level), two post-doctoral researchers, and a science writer/photographer. <br/><br/>The project will accomplish three major goals, all of which relate to how Adélie Penguins adapt to, or cope with environmental change. Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual's lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability). Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region."

In previous symposia, U.S. scientists have made important and significant contributions to the success of the SCAR Open Science Conferences.  The SCAR-OSC provides a key platform for generating or augmenting international collaborations not generally available for graduate students and early-career researchers. The 34th SCAR-OSC meeting, Antarctica in the Global Earth System: From the Poles to the Tropics, will be held 22-26 August 2016 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  <br/><br/>The scientific program for the SCAR Open Science Conference emphasizes interdisciplinary research that places Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in a global context, providing essential perspective for students and early-career researchers. In addition to the five multi-disciplinary mini symposia there are 41 sessions that include research about the Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate evolution, ice-sheet, glacial and subglacial dynamics, diversity and evolution of life and its unique ecosystems, atmospheric, astrophysical and astronomical observations, surface processes and landscapes, observations of the cryosphere and biota responses to global weather and climate changes, among others. This support will allow a more diverse group of researchers to participate in defining the future direction of international Antarctic research and will encourage global collaboration and cooperation. It will augment the training and development of graduate students and young investigators as they benefit from the opportunity to interact with the international community of Antarctic researchers. Individuals at all levels (students to senior researchers) interested in engaging in international collaborative activities and, potentially, assuming active leadership roles in SCAR groups, will be targeted for support. The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS), an international organization that aims to facilitate interdisciplinary research collaborations and develop future leaders in polar research, education and outreach, will have a one-day career development workshop available for early-career researchers at the 34th SCAR Open Science Conference."

Working with a large data set of fine art paintings, the project will investigate a computational procedure to identify a list of word descriptions of different visual styles that is interpretable to humans and is further valid to encode all styles of painting. It can be difficult to provide objective grounds that necessarily determine a visual style: even for the art expert, it is not easy to explain why Claude Monet?s Poppies is classified as impressionist based on its attributes. If the computational algorithm automatically finds semantic attributes determining visual styles that are recognizable to human observers, the result will provide scientific analysis of the human visual perceptual process which is known to be complex to specify. After stabilization, the algorithm will generate annotations describing visual styles for a massive image data set without expensive human work. This data set will be useful data set for future computer vision research. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Seung Wan Hwang in the Data Intelligence Lab at Yonsei University in Korea. Professor Hwang has devised qualitative and quantitative methods to find semantic attributes through data pattern analysis.<br/><br/>This award supports a research study to design an attributes learner algorithm from datasets that will enable classification of fine art painting styles, and produce extended datasets containing valuable features of the art work that can be annotated automatically via learned attributes generators. Rather than an expensive training set of annotations to learn the attributes of interest, the PI will design a learner which automatically harvests attributes without human supervision. This approach eliminates the need for a predefined (and potentially subjective) vocabulary of semantic attributes which require expert annotation. The project will use numeric high dimensional data gotten through a Deep Artificial Neural Net (ANN) model. The ANN model is trained through a big image data targeting art style inference. With the unsupervised deep architecture that correlates images and textural data through a shared hidden layer, it is expected that the hidden layer?s positive or negative variables will be interpreted as informative attributes. The data set will include some amount of redundant and hard-to-decipher information, so it requires compression and translation to human-interpretable concepts. Since available ground truth information of the data set is limited to authors, year, and art style, cooperative work with the hosting researcher will focus on the extraction of pattern information between the ground truth information and numeric data. There has been similar research work related to feature extraction in academia, but regarding the new subject of Fine Art style and unsupervised attributes learning, this research will be innovative. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

The study of randomly generated matrices is one of the most exciting areas of mathematics today, with theoretical advances giving us an ever-growing picture of what ""typical"" matrices are like, and providing us with important applications in areas like image compression and the analysis of the Big Data that surrounds us.  In this project, the PI will continue her research program investigating the behavior of very large random matrices, and how that behavior depends on the way they are generated; this will advance the theory, which will help better understand the applications to some of the areas mentioned above. She will also complete her monograph ""The Random Matrix Theory of the Compact Classical Groups"", which gives an overview of what has been learned about randomly generated matrices with a particular relationship to high-dimensional geometry; this activity will disseminate difficult technical knowledge about random matrices to a broad audience.   The PI is active in teaching at all levels, and particularly in mentoring and encouraging girls and young women interested in mathematical careers; those training and outreach activities will have great impact on the diversity of those entering STEM fields.<br/><br/>The monograph mentioned above will describe the remarkable advances in the theory of Haar-distributed random matrices in recent years.  Topics will include central limit theorems for the entries of principal sub-matrices and for general lower-dimensional projections, quantitative limit results for the empirical spectral measures, self-similarity patterns within the eigenvalue distributions, concentration of measure with geometric applications, including new proofs of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and Dvoretzky's theorem, and results on the distribution of the characteristic polynomial, with connections to the Riemann zeta function.  New research projects include the study of random matrices whose distributions are invariant under rotations in matrix space, continued work on quantitative approximations of empirical spectral measures for various classes of random matrices, and in various metrics, and problems in random topology connected with topological data analysis."

The resilient and programmable metro optical networking system is important because it can enable data traffic bottlenecks to be rapidly resolved and high bandwidth applications such as big data, telemedicine, and video to be flexibly moved to high capacity express-ways. For example, large volumes of data could be rapidly moved out of the path of natural disasters such as hurricanes. With this innovation, following a disaster, available live fiber connections can be flexibly managed to enable the highest available capacity and connectivity. This project will result in a proof-of-concept reconfigurable fiber system that has the unique capability to automatically switch the metro fiber connections between different metro, access, and data center optical transmission systems. These features provide a more efficient use of fiber infrastructure, more cost effective and reliable fiber capacity for high bandwidth services, and greater resilience to natural disasters.  <br/><br/>This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This new reconfigurable fiber system will enable optical networks to be reconfigured to provide wavelength and fiber scale bandwidth on demand in metro networks. The main concept involves using space switching in metro network nodes or central offices to reconfigure the fiber connectivity across multiple communication platforms including reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexing (ROADM) and other access and distribution optical systems. Novel optical physical layer control algorithms and software defined networking (SDN) based protocols will be used to manage switching over optically amplified links on fast time scales. Additional optical elements or accelerators are introduced based on the switching requirements. In addition, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers involved in this project will receive technology transfer and entrepreneurship experiences through the proof-of-concept development and evaluation, and the business and use case development together with industry and government leaders. <br/><br/>The project engages the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), Silicon Harlem, and Calient Technologies in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

Tropical societies and ecosystems rely heavily on monsoon rainfall, and thus understanding the origin and nature of decadal-scale hydroclimate variability is critical to understanding the dynamics at play in such systems.<br/><br/>Recent field studies of Indo-Pacific hydroclimate suggests that over the last millennium, the TRB may have contracted during the Little Ice Age (LIA)  thereby producing reduced monsoon rainfall along both the northern and southern margins of the TRB.  In contrast, paleohydrologic and modeling studies show that the global TRB shifted southward meridionally at this time, creating anti-phasing (dry/wet) of rainfall between the TRB northern and southern margins. <br/><br/>The researchers have developed a sub-decadal resolved (~4 year) late Holocene (the last 3,000 years) IASM reconstruction from cave KNI-51 that, when integrated with paleomonsoon records from Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent, reveal not only TRB contraction during the LIA, but expansion and contraction at multi-decadal to centennial time scales over the entirety of the late Holocene. <br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are to extend the KNI-51 stalagmite record through the middle and early Holocene (9,000-3,000 years ago) to examine the nature of TRB dynamics during conditions distinct from those of the late Holocene, including elevated contrasts between summer insolation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, lower eustatic sea level (and increased exposure of Indo-Pacific continental shelf), intervals of reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) regime. <br/><br/>To better understand atmospheric circulation associated with TRB dynamics, these proxy data will be integrated with climate dynamical analyses of the 6,000 year time slice simulations conducted within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5/Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP5/PMIP3) framework and with the newly available Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) simulations conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/><br/>The project involves the potential for a unique view of TRB variability over the last 9,000 years and provides an important test of the skill of CMIP5-class models to accurately reproduce associated Indo-Pacific atmospheric dynamics.  As the TRB is closely tied to tropical methane production, this research will help refine estimates of regional tropical methane fluxes during the Holocene. The research will be conducted with extensive involvement of undergraduate students thereby providing experience in advanced paleoclimate research and data analysis techniques."

However, a significant limitation is its tendency to creep over long durations. This is especially problematic in high-rise building, as undesirable creep deformations can involve expensive repairs, strengthening, or replacement, or can ultimately result in fracture and failure. The large time scales over which such deformations occur (years) make it challenging, if not impossible, to directly assess the creep propensity of concrete. To this end, numerous predictive models of creep have been suggested. However, most of them lack a sound physical basis and are heavily parameterized, which renders their predictions questionable at best, especially for new emerging binders in which ordinary portland cement is partially or fully replaced by more environment-friendly materials like fly ash, slag or limestone. This project aims to identify the physical origin of the creep in concrete to enable reliable long-term predictions of creep deformations. Based on this knowledge, new testing protocols will be studied, and creep-resistant cementitious binders will be identified. This research integrates multiple disciplines, including physics, material science, and civil engineering and will train a diverse group of students to multi-dimensional engineering.<br/><br/>To elucidate the physical origin of creep in concrete, and to discriminate, e.g., between the sliding or dissolution-precipitation mechanisms, this research relies on a combination of simulations. All simulations mutually feed into each others and capture the contribution of each of the relevant scales of cementitious binders. This bottom-up strategy starts from atomistic molecular dynamics coupled with topological constraint theory, culminates in continuum finite element simulations, and benefits from mesoscale modeling to ensure the hand-shake of all the considered spatial scales. Each simulation will be systematically informed, complemented, and validated by experiments, which comprise indentation, vertical scanning interferometry, and uniaxial creep tests. This interdisciplinary effort will identify the decisive variables (e.g., composition, nanostructure, and chemical instability) that render a material sensitive, or not, to long-term aging phenomena such as creep. Pioneering accelerated perturbation-based simulation methods will be evaluated, which will permit the study of long-term aging and degradation phenomena in amorphous materials rapidly. Finally, the project will contribute to reveal the link between bulk properties (chemical composition, structure) and surface properties (e.g., dissolution rates)."

A dynamical system consists of a state space, in which a point represents a complete description of the state of the system, and a rule governing the evolution of the system from one state to another. This project focuses on the long-term behavior of such systems from two complementary points of view. From the first point of view, the project seeks to describe the behavior of typical systems when the rules of evolution are chosen at random. Such results shed light on what properties one might expect to find in disordered systems. The second point of view, the ""inverse problem,"" concerns the statistical problem of recovering some information from the observation of a dynamical system. While there are many examples of dynamical systems being used as mathematical models, and there is a large statistical literature regarding inference and estimation, the performance of statistical procedures when applied to data generated by nonlinear dynamical systems is poorly understood. This project focuses on characterizing when traditional statistical procedures may be effectively applied in the context of dynamical systems. Beyond the very fertile potential applications, the project will also have broader impact on training of graduate students who will acquire invaluable skills in sound probabilistic modeling and statistical inference by working on the project's research topics.<br/><br/>Symbolic dynamical systems, which may be defined in terms of discrete constraints on the possible trajectories, serve as prototypical models of systems that evolve over time. Random ensembles of these systems may be produced by selecting the constraints at random. Ideas from both discrete probability and dynamical systems may then be used to analyze the structural properties of the resulting systems with high probability. For the inverse problem, this project seeks to evaluate the performance of several statistical inference procedures, both frequentist and Bayesian, when the models involved are dynamical systems. Fundamental questions about convergence and consistency of the procedures may be addressed using tools from ergodic theory, such as joinings and the thermodynamic formalism."

It may also facilitate the production of cheaper fertilizers for agriculture.  The field of bioinorganic chemistry is diverse and includes a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry.  Many different experimental techniques and theoretical methods are combined to study the formation, function and regulation of the metal cofactors, as well as the mechanism of these metal-containing enzymes.  For these reasons, research in this area is generally highly collaborative.  This workshop will train students, postdoctoral scholars and faculty members from primarily undergraduate institutions in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, setting the stage for future discoveries in this exciting field. <br/><br/>With this award, the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is co-funding a biennial training workshop, which is led by Prof. Carsten Krebs and colleagues at the Department of Chemistry at The Pennsylvania State University.  The 2016 workshop provides training for approximately 150 participants and encompasses (i) 17 lectures by faculty experts in the field in their area of specialty, (ii) hands-on training in 21 different methods offered to small groups of up to 6 participants in 2-hour time-blocks (repeated up to 12 times) and taught by 70 student/postdoc/faculty experts in bioinorganic methods and (iii) research presentations in the form of posters and 12 talks by selected students and postdoctoral scholars.  This workshop will uniquely train the next generation of researchers in the field of bioinorganic chemistry."

An overarching goal of this project is to determine whether observed changes in key climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity are a result of human activities, related to naturally occurring climate variability, or a combination of both. Given its influential agricultural sector, climate variability and change in South America can have global ramifications. <br/><br/>This goal will be accomplished through two tasks. The first task is to assess whether the changes in these key climate variables differ significantly from trends that could arise as a result of naturally occurring climate variability. The extent to which humans have influenced climate over the continent to date will also be quantified. The second task will be to systematically examine mechanisms leading to natural climate variability over South America, including patterns of variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Using this comprehensive understanding of the natural and anthropogenic influences on observed changes in climate, the ability of current state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce these features in simulations of the past will be evaluated.  In the case that a given climate model can simulate observed trends in climate and features of natural climate variability with reasonable skill, confidence in future projections of climate can be boosted. A major goal of this project to develop methods of conveying the multi-dimensional nature of the investigation results in a concise and easily interpretable way to better inform those communities interested in climate information for South America.  Furthermore, the approaches and methods used here will be extensible to other regions of the world.    <br/><br/>Key results of the project will be presented, interpreted, and made publicly available via a user-friendly website to serve both scientific and non-scientific audiences. These results will be communicated throughout the South American climate science and information communities via an email list associated with the World Climate Research Programme's Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).  Additionally, the project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral scientist and a graduate student.  All team members will participate in publishing results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in reporting results at relevant professional conferences and meetings. In all cases, the presentation style will aim to the broad community interested in South American climate science and information."

The target group of students consists of undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines, with a preference for underrepresented groups in STEM fields and students from small colleges where there are few research opportunities. The program will encourage minority student applications through contacts with other minority-serving internship programs on campus, recommendations from professional contacts at minority serving institutions, and a broad advertising campaign targeted at minority colleges and universities.   <br/><br/>Since the projects are designed to be part of cutting edge solar physics research, student projects will frequently result in joint professional publications or presentations with their CfA mentors, providing undergraduates with valuable motivation and career development experiences. Since Solar Physics is taught at relatively few colleges and universities, this program provides an important service to the discipline. With its strong Space Weather component it has the double benefit to society of adding to our understanding of potential space hazards. Moreover, former participants of this program have reported that the exposure to professional research in a university environment has helped them to decide whether to continue their education in graduate school, and whether or not to pursue research as a profession.

The dynamic auroras that appear in the polar regions are visual indicators of energy flowing into the atmosphere from disturbances raging in near-Earth space.  Electrons and ions, that power the auroral emissions, travel down magnetic field lines from these disturbances and must be further accelerated along the way. For several decades, the majority of the acceleration was thought to be the result of electrons and ions traversing quasi-static potential drops while moving down magnetic field lines.  These potential drops are created when two parallel oppositely-charged layers form in the plasma setting up an electric field and an associated voltage drop.  The auroral electrons are accelerated through the voltage drop creating a single energy peak. Recently the significance of time dependent acceleration of electrons by kinetic Alfven waves has become clear. Kinetic Alfven waves are formed under certain circumstances when Alfven waves (traveling along the magnetic field communicating the effects of changes elsewhere in the field) develop an electric field parallel to the background magnetic field.  In contrast to the previous mechanism, the parallel wave electric fields accelerate electrons over a broad energy range.   However, neither of these processes is well understood.  To complicate things, both processes are influenced by coupling and feedbacks with the ionosphere.  The PI has developed a compelling new theory that the two processes are related (i.e., that kinetic Alfven waves transition to a quasi-steady state forming parallel potential drops).  The focus here is on testing this theory.  Broader impacts of the work include the training of a graduate student and communication of results through public outreach. The research is expected to be of broad interest to other plasma physics communities. In the longer-term, it will contribute to better understanding of the space environment, resulting in improved forecasts, and the development of efficient mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable technologies of value to society.  <br/><br/>The approach combines theory and modeling with the goal of including a large range of temporal and spatial scales involved in the transition from time-dependent to quasi-steady conditions, a large parameter range, feedbacks through ionospheric reflection of the Alfven waves and by modifications of the ionospheric conductivity due to the precipitating electrons, as well as by the formation and effects of density cavities along the auroral field lines.   The primary tool is an already developed linearized two-fluid model, which will be modified to include: nonlinear electron dynamics along the magnetic field line and a realistic dipole magnetic field geometry.  This model combined with a kinetic electron model will be used to investigate the acceleration of electrons and their self-consistent interactions with the kinetic Alfven waves."

As a vital nutrient, the availability of nitrogen in a biologically usable form often ""limits"" the growth of plants both on land as well as in the ocean.  Paradoxically, nitrogen is very abundant as dinitrogen gas (N2) in both the Earth's atmosphere and dissolved in seawater.  However in this chemical form, nitrogen cannot be used by most living things.  Only a small subset of microbes has the ability to ""fix"" N2 gas, that is, to convert it into a biologically usable chemical form.  Thus, these N2 fixing organisms provide a critical environmental function sustaining life on this planet.  In the ocean, N2 fixation is a major control on the total amount of biologically available nitrogen, balancing over the time losses back to N2 gas.  The amount of biologically available nitrogen in turn controls the growth (productivity) of photosynthetic organisms (phytoplankton) in the sunlit region of the surface ocean which form the base of the food chain and contribute to oceanic control of the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. <br/><br/>This project concerns itself with understanding the fundamental, large-scale controls of oceanic N2 fixation and how they are influenced by climate change over time.  N2 fixing microbes themselves appeared to be limited by the availability of other nutrient elements such as phosphorous and iron.  While it is known in which parts of the ocean there is at present greater or lesser availability of phosphorous and iron, it remains unclear if either is of overriding importance or if changes in the past produced significant variations in N2 fixation.  Past changes in N2 fixation may have been an important feedback on oceanic control of atmospheric greenhouse gases.  Understanding these past changes and their controls will provide the knowledge base for improving prediction of how ocean N2 fixation may respond to future changes in climate. This is of great societal relevance as changes in oceanic N2 fixation will ultimately impact marine ecosystems and living resources as feedback on the greenhouse gases driving climate change.<br/><br/>To address these questions, the research team will undertake a study the climate-sensitivity of N2 fixation in the southeast Pacific gyre over the last glacial cycle as well as its plausible ""master controls"". This oligotrophic region experiences little modern N2 fixation despite proximity to a large supply of excess phosphate from the adjacent Peru-Chile oxygen minimum zone. This is consistent with modern iron limitation due to low aeolian supply that would have been relieved during past dusty conditions. The research team will use the natural experiment of the last full glacial cycle, captured in the foraminiferal-bound N isotopes of gyre sites as well as sites at its southern margin, to probe controls on the marine N cycle exerted by variable dust inputs and changes in N-loss in the adjacent oxygen minimum zone, and relate these to known changes in greenhouse forcing of climate. Through numerical modeling, the research team will also consider whether past variations in N2 fixation in this region may have impacted the global ocean N cycle and budget. <br/><br/>This project will also fund the training of undergraduate and graduate students and support participation of high school students from underrepresented groups in original research.  The research team will continue their outreach efforts through established partnerships with elementary, middle, and high schools, engaging a diverse school population and their families with exciting and relevant science."

Many pathogens deliver effector proteins into their hosts to promote virulence of the pathogen. Over evolutionary time, the plant can evolve to recognize specific effector proteins from the pathogen. The PI's research group has identified a plant protein (a ""decoy"") that acts as a ""mousetrap"" for a pathogen effector protein, and enables the plant to mount a strong immune response. This work will determine the genetic parameters necessary for pathogen recognition in the host, in order to help design better decoys and protect crops from infection. This project includes substantial outreach to a local two-year college that serves a diverse student body, including underrepresented groups (37% Hispanic, 24% African American, 19% Asian, 1% Hawaiian) and underprivileged students (68% receive financial aid), in order to expose students to cutting-edge research and broader educational opportunities. <br/><br/>Dissection of the molecular determinants underlying host immunity will provide a rigorous toolkit to combat the significant problem posed by plant pathogens. HopZ1a, a Pseudomonas syringae type III secreted effector protein, is recognized indirectly through ZAR1, a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat containing receptor protein, when HopZ1a acetylates the ZED1 pseudokinase. ZED1 appears to be a decoy that has evolved to trap the T3SE into recognition, as it is not a functional kinase and does not have a role in basal immunity. This work will examine ZAR1 and ZED1 natural and mutant diversity in order to develop constraints for rational design of a pathogen decoy. The PI will collaborate with a local two-year college that primarily serves underprivileged students and underrepresented groups, and will host several students each summer to learn new scientific techniques. The lab will design a module on plant immunity that will be taught in the college. This will provide teaching opportunities for students and post-docs, and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Together these efforts will encourage underrepresented students to pursue and excel at multi-disciplinary scientific research, provide outreach opportunities for graduate students and post-docs, and make progress on significant scientific and agricultural problems."

Similar to glass lenses, which focus light, these devices allow for focusing or otherwise manipulating radio and microwaves. In particular, devices with spatially varying magnetic and dielectric properties offer exciting and innumerate possibilities for electromagnetic wave shaping but remain to be realized due to lack of practical fabrication techniques. Inkjet printing provides a promising approach to manufacturing such devices: inks of different composition (e.g., containing magnetic and dielectric nanoparticles) can be dispensed in varying ratio within the volume of the device to implement the desired spatial gradient in magneto dielectric properties. The goal of this industry university collaboration is to demonstrate devices, fabricated by 3D inkjet printing, with tailor-made spatial variation in magnetic and dielectric properties to achieve wave shaping as needed by a given application. The demonstration will pave the way for advanced devices such as antenna lenses that beam radio or microwave signals only to a specific WiFi enabled machine or within the perimeter of a specific room to mitigate the risk of signal interference or interception. The project will also create a unique educational and professional development opportunity for participating students, who will acquire expertise and industry experience, via internships, in advanced manufacturing, an area of significant economic importance to the U.S. Further, in partnership with a local library, talks aimed at public education in 3D printing technologies will be presented. <br/><br/>This collaborative GOALI project seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of microwave and radio frequency magneto-dielectric devices, with specifically designed, spatially varying electric permittivity and magnetic permeability.

The devices will be printed in a layer-by-layer sequence with polymerizable inks containing high permeability magnetic and high permittivity dielectric nanoparticles. A key challenge, due to particle loading constraints when jetting inks, will be attaining the requisite range of permeability and permittivity in the printed composite medium. Inks formulated with commercial nanoparticles will be used to conduct a rapid survey of electromagnetic properties possible in the composites. The results of the survey will guide subsequent ink design with custom nanoparticles. The size, dispersion and loading of the nanoparticles in the inks will be optimized for ink-jettability and range of electromagnetic properties achieved in the printed composites."

The project activities would integrate research with education and training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, with significant minority participation. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop novel graphene-based flexible ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) sensors for the measurement of K+, Ca2+ and Na+ ion concentrations and correlated ion fluxes in cardiomyocytes and glial cells, with the overall objective of developing a new approach for assaying cell membrane ion transport in primary cell culture. The detection of the aforementioned ions is clinically significant as they serve as important bio-markers for onset of myocardial ischemia and epilepsy.  The proposed graphene ISFET sensor array will enable critical understanding of K+, Ca2+ and Na+ membrane transport in glial cells and cardiomyocytes. The approach of ISFET development utilizing the novel properties of boron nitride and graphene addresses several critical issues including: (i) the complicacy, low throughput and cell invasiveness issues of patch clamp and microelectrode array based techniques, and (ii) the low sensitivity and degradation of commercially available Si-based ISFETs. The experimental plan includes growing cells directly on graphene and performing continuous, real-time and label-free measurements of ion fluxes in cardiomyocytes and glial cells.  The measurements acquired are expected to provide electrophysiological properties of primary cells in culture, especially regulatory and drug-induced changes in their electrical properties.  Successful completion would result in the development of useful ISFET sensors for in vivo detection of the onset of myocardial ischemia and epilepsy. As  part of the educational and outreach activities, the PIs would each involve at least one undergraduate and one high school student to work on this project every year focusing strongly on recruiting minority students. The PIs would also integrate research results in a graduate course, and disseminate them through conference participation as well as research websites.<br/>&#8195;"

Specifically, this project investigates how all the components that make up the beryllium atom, the fourth element on the periodic table, come together to give beryllium its atomic and nuclear properties.  Our knowledge of atomic systems is driven by both experimental and theoretical results.  The lighter elements (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically.  Because beryllium has more subatomic particles compared to the three lighter elements, it is more complex and difficult to model.  As the computations involved in modeling this atom grow more complex, it becomes essential to provide experimental results to both check those calculations and determine which theoretical models correctly describe this multi-electron system.  The most precise experimental measurements currently available for beryllium are up to 10,000 times less precise than those for the three lighter elements. This project will greatly improve upon these experimental measurements in order to validate fundamental atomic and nuclear theories as well as provide information about the nuclear and electronic structure of the atom. Understanding beryllium is an important stepping stone to developing a multi-electron theory that successfully describes larger and heavier atoms, which make up the bulk of the periodic table of the elements and are essential components of the materials that we live and work with every day.<br/> <br/>High precision spectroscopy will be performed on the neutral beryllium isotope chain to significantly improve the experimental accuracy of several key energy levels.  The results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium.  Spectroscopy will be performed on both singlet states (2s2p, 2s3d, and 2snp Rydberg states) and triplet states (2s2p, 2s3s, 2s4s, and 2snp Rydberg states) as well as the ionization threshold.  An oven operating at 1200 degrees Celsius will produce a beam of neutral atomic beryllium.  Transverse spectroscopy will be performed on this atomic beam using a variety of laser sources including a frequency quadrupled Ti-Sapphire laser and external cavity diode lasers.  Photon energy calibration is provided by a calibrated ultra low expansion cavity and the atom-light interaction is detected by absorption, fluorescence, or ion detection depending on the state being studied."

In the case of coastal Alaska over the past several thousand years, the available data indicate that for the most part, the answer has been ""not much"" - the marine ecosystem seems to have remained relatively stable, even through periods of climate change such as the Medieval Warm Period and the so-called ""Little Ice Age"". The one exception to this generalization is found on Unalaska Island, in the eastern Aleutians. At about 4000 years ago, ringed seals, which are an ice-adapted species, made up a significant portion of the subsistence base. This suggests that temperatures were substantially colder than they are today. However, many of the species that are common in the area today (in the absence of significant levels of sea ice) were also an important part of the subsistence economy 4000 years ago.  <br/><br/>This research aims to try to address this apparent contradiction; was it cold and icy? Or was it generally more temperate, much as it is today? To do so, the scientists will (a) study the growth patterns and shell chemistry of modern and archaeological butter clams, which will give us an indication of what the water conditions were like. They will also (b) conduct a detailed analysis of all of the species present in the archaeological midden sites, including the age composition of what was being harvested, as an indication of what the environmental conditions were like. And, finally, they will (c) conduct a detailed analysis of the artifacts associated with marine mammal hunting to determine the likelihood that hunters 4000 years ago developed a specialized toolkit for hunting in the sea ice.<br/><br/>As coastal communities throughout the Arctic face important decisions regarding the possibility of major climate change, the research team believes that it will be important to have some ""test cases"" that provide information on how various communities have responded to climate change in the past. The archaeological sites on Unalaska Island provide nearly 4000 years worth of data of adaptation to past climate change; data that are directly relevant to understanding the challenges of future climate change.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of Late Holocene climate change on animal biodiversity and human foraging activity in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. This three-year, interdisciplinary study will use zooarchaeological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in Late Holocene climate significantly affected local environments, ecosystems, and human hunting strategy in the eastern Aleutian Islands. This interdisciplinary project will apply models of human foraging behavior to research human-animal-environmental interactions in the context of climate change using three major lines of evidence: 1) growth patterns and stable oxygen isotopes in archaeological shellfish will be used to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; 2) archaeological faunal material from several taxonomic groups will be used to test whether animal distribution and behavior have changed through time in response to changes in climate; 3) artifacts will be analyzed to look for adaptations to the marine mammal hunting toolkit in response to changes in climate and resource availability. More specifically, the research team proposes a research program that will use multiple datasets from Unalaska Island to address whether sea ice and ice-loving (""pagophilic"") fauna were present in this region during the Neoglacial phase, suggesting a dramatic change in prehistoric climate. The interdisciplinary nature of archaeology makes it uniquely positioned to accomplish two things: 1) to offer truly long term data about the ecological, climate, and resource histories for the Gulf of Alaska, data that are vital to understanding both ancient and contemporary human and environmental interaction in this region and 2) to collaborate with local Native Alaskan communities and students, resource managers, and cultural resource managers to collect, interpret, and disseminate the data and findings."

The motion of therapeutic compounds such as proteins, small molecule drugs, antibodies, and drug carriers is usually restricted, owing to the limited space between cells and the extracellular matrix that fills this space.  Therefore, a method to increase the average pore size in brain tissue, without causing cell damage, could improve drug delivery methods to treat a variety of neurological disorders.  The investigators will design nanoparticles that are coated with polymers to promote their motion, and they will track the motion of the nanoparticles with and without exposure of the tissue to ultrasound.

Particularly challenging here is the need to ensure that memory accesses are oblivious, and do not leak information about private data. We are designing efficient oblivious data structures that can be used as general-purpose building blocks for secure protocols in the RAM model of computation. <br/><br/>This project develops a framework that enables programmers to write high-level code that can then be compiled by a back-end algorithm that analyzes the code and makes use of the oblivious data structures we provide. This work is influenced by the needs of real applications, and the techniques to analyze the exact requirements of the program will evaluated and to tailor the resulting protocol to those requirements. This project aims to develop tools making secure computation more accessible to non-specialists, so it can be more broadly used to perform computations on private data.

In the last 15 years, dense Global Positioning System (GPS) and earthquake observations made at subduction zones have revealed a new style of fault slip.  In addition to continuous slip and sudden earthquake motion, many faults experience slow slip. In some instances, a relationship between slow slip and damaging large earthquakes has been observed. Most observations of slow slip occur at 20-40 km depth below the seafloor.  At the Hikurangi margin offshore of New Zealand, slow slip also occurs at shallow depths, but detailed investigation of shallow slow slip has been hampered by the lack of suitable seafloor observations. Understanding the extent, distribution, and range of physical conditions for shallow slow slip events is important, especially since the shallow fault interface is where tsunamis are generated by earthquakes. This project uses recently collected ocean bottom seismic and absolute pressure gauge data from the Hikurangi margin to investigate the relationship between earthquake and slow slip and the physical conditions that favor them. Results of this research will be incorporated into an earthquake science course for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science program for high school students at the University of California-Santa Cruz.  This project involves the mentoring and training of three graduate students and two to four undergraduate interns, including at least one from an underrepresented group in the Earth Sciences. All students will benefit by receiving training from researchers at different institutions.<br/><br/>A large shallow slow slip event occurred in October 2014, directly beneath the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip instrument array, a major U.S. led international experiment with Japanese and New Zealand researchers.  The experiment was designed to investigate the physical environment that hosts shallow slow slip and its relationship to destructive, seismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction thrust.  This project will build on the initial data analysis from this experiment to tackle four main objectives: 1) to improve initial tremor and earthquake detection and location using the PageRank technique and matched filtering cross correlation, 2) to investigate changes in coulomb failure stress imparted on the megathrust from the 2014 slow slip event and compare it to earthquake and tremor locations to test whether static stress changes can explain their location, 3) to determine earthquake source parameters and explore their spatial and temporal relationships with slow slip, geodetic coupling and physical properties of the plate interface and 4) to improve images of seismic velocity and attenuation structure using body wave velocity and attenuation tomography and ambient noise surface wave tomography.  This project will complement similar efforts in Cascadia and Japan, allowing comparison of the properties and environment of shallow and deep slow slip and build a detailed picture of the relationship between seismic and aseismic slip and its dependence on the velocity and attenuation structure."

Large-scale land investments are often touted for providing local communities with access to capital, employment opportunities, and higher crop yields. Research suggests, however, that these investments are often accompanied by forced evictions, loss of livelihoods, and food insecurity. The link between large-scale land investments, food security, and peace remains poorly understood. Understanding this link has the potential to inform U.S. efforts to promote development and political stability in regions where food security and broader notions of security are intimately tied. This project contributes toward such an understanding by examining the local impact of large-scale land investments in northern Sudan, where Saudi, Egyptian and Emirati investors have recently acquired large tracts of land to grow food for export. In particular, it explores the social transformations set in motion by these land deals in Sudan's agricultural Gezira region. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by Stanford University anthropology doctoral student, Nisrin Elamin Abdelrahman, under the supervision of Dr. James Ferguson. Through a 12-month ethnographic study in two Gezira communities, the researcher will closely examine the role local leaders play in mediating community efforts to reclaim access to lands leased to foreign investors. She will observe dispute mediations in and outside of court settings. She will also participate in the day-to-day activities of small farmers and landless agricultural workers who are negotiating the opportunities and losses produced by recent changes in land ownership. Finally, she will trace the development of a campaign led by civil society organizations aimed at building national awareness around land rights. Data will be collected using participant observation, interviews, life histories, dispute mediation observations, and archival research. The findings can inform policy efforts to better address the context-specific impact of large-scale land investments on local people's lives. By highlighting how local leadership is mobilized to prevent conflicts over land and to broaden access to it, this research will help advance both the study and practice of peace-building in the wider region. Funding this research also supports the training of a graduate student."

The concept of mechanical stability, which dates back to the research of J. C. Maxwell in 1864, governs many fascinating phenomena in soft matter physics, from jamming of granular matter to self-assembly of novel materials and nonlinear elasticity of biological tissue.  At the same time, this concept also guides the design of new mechanical metamaterials that can perform unprecedented functions. Mechanical metamaterials display novel mechanical properties acquired through their structure instead of their composition.<br/>The PI will investigate the interplay between mechanical instability and the deformations of a soft material that cost very little energy, called floppy modes. Structures can be identified that are rigid in the bulk but have soft edges that are easily deformed with a fundamental property that peeling away the soft edges leads to a new material that also has soft edges. Using recently developed concepts related to topology, the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of objects that are preserved under deformations, material phases with different mechanical properties can be identified. The PI will study these material phases, how robust they are against imperfections and thermally driven vibrations, and how soft deformations can transform a material between different material phases when a material is close to a mechanical instability.<br/>The PI will use the understanding gained from the study of these ""topologically protected"" mechanical phases and the transformations among them to design new mechanical metamaterials.  The PI will also study what will happen when these novel devices are made small enough that thermal fluctuations are important, as well as producing these structures via self-assembly.<br/>This project not only aims at a fundamental understanding of the physics of structures near mechanical instabilities, but also provides guidance to the design of new generation mechanical materials that have robust properties and functions.  Moreover, the project includes outreach activities which increase the awareness of the general public on soft matter physics and its contributions to our daily life, as well as educational activities that broaden participation of women and other minorities in physics through outreach in local schools and group discussions among female physics students.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research, outreach, and education on soft materials and designing new mechanical metamaterials using new concepts.  Central to many fascinating phenomena in soft matter physics are a collection of floppy modes, which are modes of deformations that cost little energy and signals mechanical instability. Examples include the yielding of jammed granular matter and the nonlinear elasticity of biological tissue.  In the meantime, recently there has been an explosion of investigations on mechanical metamaterials, which are materials that gain their novel mechanical properties, such as negative Poisson's ratio, negative compressibility, negative thermal expansion, phononic band-gap, via their structure instead of their composition. Interestingly, in many cases the key to realize the novel properties of these mechanical metamaterials, is also a collection of floppy modes, which are often called mechanisms.<br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the topology and entropy of structures that are close to mechanical instabilities and exhibit floppy modes. The two main thrusts are to investigate: (1) Topological transitions in mechanical systems and design principles of transformable topological mechanical metamaterials, (2) Entropic effects on floppy modes, which will be used to understand self-assembly of mechanical metamaterials as well as design principles of machines and robots at small scales with mechanisms robust against fluctuations.  The methods that will be used in this project include analytic theory and numerical simulations.<br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from (1) the general classification of the unusual mechanical and acoustic properties of critical mechanical structures, (2) the characterization of novel topological transitions in mechanical systems, which share intriguing similarities with transitions in quantum topological states of matter, (3) the characterization of thermal fluctuation effects on floppy modes that exhibit interesting interplay with topology and guides the selection of robust mechanisms, (4) the designs and predictions on the self-assembly of novel open structures.<br/>This award also supports outreach activities which increase the awareness of the general public on soft matter physics and its contributions to our daily life, as well as educational activities that broaden participation of women and other minorities in physics through outreach in local schools and group discussions among female physics students."

The shift to shallow tube wells, however, has exposed tens of millions of people to arsenic, which causes cancer and other health problems. Groundwater arsenic is a major problem in several countries in the Americas and Asia. One mitigation approach has been for households to switch to deep public tube wells that are mostly >500 feet deep because they tap water in an aquifer that is low in arsenic. Although deep tube wells are being installed to reduce exposure to arsenic, the health effects of switching to these often more distant, wells has not been adequately investigated. A concern is that water obtained from a distant well may be stored for a longer period of time in the home, thereby increasing the risk of microbial contamination by extended handling and use. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of whether deep tube wells installed through arsenic mitigation programs are a safe drinking water source in countries groundwater arsenic problem. It also provides insights about the circumstances in which household drinking water storage containers are most likely to be contaminated with waterborne pathogens. Lastly, the study develops a rich database on water, sanitation, hygiene that will be made available and can be linked to another large survey on the health, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics of the same study population. <br/><br/>This study integrates theory and methods from the disease ecology tradition of medical geography and environmental microbiology. It combines geographic and environmental microbiology methods with community surveys to provide information that is critical for developing drinking water policies and programs. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine if deep tube wells protect against diarrheal diseases compared to shallow tube wells, (2) compare the microbial water quality of deep and shallow tube well sources and from household storage containers with water from those wells, and (3) determine if longer travel distance and time to deep tube wells leads to longer duration of water storage, poor water quality in storage containers, and higher diarrheal disease incidence. The study will be conducted in Bangladesh where groundwater arsenic is most severe. A household survey will determine water source, use, storage, hygiene, and sanitation practices. The microbial water quality of tube wells and household water storage containers will be measured for the presence and concentrations of E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria. Distance to tube wells will be measured using a geographic information system database that includes households and tube wells. The analysis will determine if distance/travel time/storage time is related to water quality in storage containers and diarrheal diseases."

Why, then, do many individuals become and remain attached to the legacies of some charismatic leaders? The PI conducts a survey experiment that directly tests the strategies and conditions under which new leaders can reactivate citizens' attachment to political parties that were established as vehicles for charismatic leaders in order to garner political support. The results of this study will inform debates about the nature and consequences of charismatic leadership across disciplines including political science, sociology, psychology, and business management. Furthermore, the project will clarify how different types of attachment to charismatic legacies might strengthen or undermine democratic representation and electoral competition. Finally, the results can serve to inform political communication and campaign strategy in countries with strong charismatic legacies.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project investigates the nature and evolution of citizens' attachments to weakly institutionalized political movements founded by charismatic leaders. The PI argues that new leaders can tap into the charismatic founders' legacies to sustain or reactivate support through one of three mechanisms: 1) a programmatic mechanism that link citizens' ties to the movement through programs and policies; 2)a grassroots mechanism that posits that citizens' attachments are preserved through participation in the movement' organizations; 3) a personalistic mechanism that indicates that citizens' attachments remain anchored in the founder's charisma.  The PI test these three mechanisms through a survey experiment that examines the relative influence of each mechanism on citizens' attachment to the legacy parties. Individuals are randomly assigned to read a short news piece containing one of four experimental conditions, three of which will prime either the programmatic, grassroots, or personalistic aspects of the movement, and the fourth of which will contain no prime. Subsequently, participants will answer questions about their identification with the movement, support for its leaders, emotional attachment, and political attitudes and behaviors. The PI uses difference-of-means and difference-of-proportions tests to examine which mechanism provides the basis for followers' attachments to the movement. The Pi uses Argentina and Venezuela as the cases of interest."

Consequently, improvements in combustion performance to increase fuel efficiency and reduce the emission of harmful pollutants are important.  The classical fire triangle shows that for sustained combustion to occur, heat, fuel, and a supply of oxidizer must be present; a reduction of any of these can make a flame burn less robustly, which may result in a decrease in temperature, an increase in flame fluctuations, and ultimately flame extinction. Interestingly, sometimes these nearly extinguished flames exhibit the highest combustion performance (i.e., high efficiency and low emissions).  Since water is commonly used to extinguish unwanted flames, it is important to determine if just the right amount of water can potentially produce high performance near-extinction combustion.  In addition, some next-generation fuels have very high water content that can naturally produce this same near-extinction behavior.  The proposed research explores the role of water when it is introduced as a fuel side reactant in a non-premixed flame. The broad scientific and technical impact of this work includes an improved understanding of combustion chemistry of systems that incorporate water naturally or artificially to manipulate the combustion process.  The project is of great value to undergraduates, graduates, and international scholars interested in sustainable energy; it will incorporate research participation for students at all levels, as well as opportunities to extend professional collaborations. The project will also broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and as part of the NSF-funded Louis-Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP).<br/><br/>The technical focus of the work is to explore the role of water, over a range of pressures between 1-50 atm and operating conditions, in diffusion flames using a co-flow jet and counter-flow burner configuration. This work will look specifically at flame extinction due to the addition of water, which significantly reduces flame temperature and also dilutes the fuel-air mixture.  Measurements include flame temperature and concentrations of important radical species involved in inhibiting combustion. The methods for measuring temperature will include thermocouples, thin filament pyrometry, and Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). Qualitative measurements of OH and CO will employ planar laser induced fluorescence. Experimental results will be compared with computational fluid dynamic calculations and with detailed chemical kinetics calculations for both atmospheric and high pressure conditions.

Network analysis has a great potential for uncovering such important interconnections amongst vortical structures (eddies) in unsteady flows. With knowledge of which interactions are important on the vortical network, graph theory and network analysis can provide guidelines on how to describe the collective dynamics of unsteady fluid flows. The use of network analysis will provide a transformative change to how we examine vortical interactions and energy transfers in fluid flows. By developing the network formulation of fluid flows, we can analyze the resilience of fluid networks against perturbations and external forcing inputs. Understanding the resilience of vortex-interaction networks allows us to identify the sensitive vortical structures and types of disturbances that can globally affect the dynamics of unsteady fluid flows, in a manner complementary to the hydrodynamic stability analysis."

As these applications demanded higher performance, the field of materials research has shifted its focus from using singular NMs (carbon only, metal only) to those comprised of several distinct types of NMs linked together, termed nanohybrids (NHs). Linking single NMs in this capacity is likely to create new properties and behavior in environmental and biological settings that have not yet been predicted or studied. As the scale of NH use rapidly increases there is likely to be significant opportunity for their presence in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the goal of this proposed work is to proactively identify novel and unanticipated properties and associated behavior of carbon-metal NHs that have current relevance to the fuel cell industry. These studies would be the first to investigate whether combining singular NMs to form NHs alters the way they behave in the environment and interact with aquatic organisms. <br/><br/>Extracting novel properties by developing ensembles of two or more nano-scale materials is an emerging trend in several industries. However, most of our knowledge regarding nano-environmental behavior is limited to passive nanostructures with singular composition (e.g. carbon, metal). We hypothesize that NHs will display novel unforeseen properties that are highly important in driving their behavior in environmental matrices and organisms. To address this notion we propose to carry out the following aims: (1) synthesize a set of metal-carbon nanotube NHs with high degree of control with the objective of tuning band architecture and material stiffness; (2) characterize physical morphology, mechanical stiffness, band gap, distribution of metal/metal oxides on nanotubes; (3) examine NH interaction with the environmental interfaces by studying particle-particle and particle-collector interaction as well as determining particle dissolution in a wide range of environmental conditions; (4) assess behavior and interaction of NHs at biological interfaces using a well-established aquatic model coupled with high-throughput contemporary measurements of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This work is innovative in that it is the first to execute controlled synthesis and characterization of a suite of NHs and component materials that will be investigated in aquatic environments and model organisms (fish). This work is timely in that it will lay the foundation for further research in understanding NHs in complex but relevant environments and reveal novel properties and mechanisms of action in biological systems that have not been studied. <br/><br/>The proposed work will generate critical and fundamental knowledge to better understand the environmental interaction of a set of complex hierarchical nanomaterials, metal-carbonaceous NHs.  These NHs are highly relevant to the expanding fuel cell industry; therefore, results of this work would directly influence materials science and nano communities and help inform the general public about nano-environmental research. In outreach and education aspects the PIs will recruit undergraduate researchers, including underrepresented students, through several well established programs at UT and UF such as Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering (GLUE) program, Texas Research Experience (TREX) program, Florida-Georgia Alliance for Minority Participation (FGAMP-SEAGEP) and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Science for Life programs to recruit minority students."

Amputees typically wear a flexible liner made of silicone or similar material over the residual limb and under their prosthesis to provide padding and improve comfort and fit. The main drawback of the liner is that it insulates the limb, creating a very warm environment leading to excess sweating. Overheating and excessive sweat often results in rashes, blistering, and the prosthesis sliding off the limb. Active amputees must regularly remove their prosthesis and liner to remove the sweat that has accumulated.  These factors can limit the motivation of amputees to exercise, thus negatively impacting rehabilitation.  The JHU technology comprises a cooling liner which replaces the current liner worn under the prosthesis.  The cooling liner has embedded tubing through which ice water is pumped to cool the limb and reduce sweat.  If successfully developed this product has the potential to significantly improve the lives of amputees, making it easier for them to use their prosthesis and to exercise, while reducing the potential for skin damage and other problems that result from excess heat and sweat under the prosthesis.<br/><br/>Walter Reed National Military Medical Center approached JHU to develop a solution for amputees' heat and sweat problems.  This led students in JHU's Mechanical Engineering Department to create a manufacturing method to embed coolant tubes into a silicone liner, so that coolant fluid can be circulated around the limb, reducing skin temperature and sweat production.  The coolant is ice water, which is stored in a reservoir (e.g. a waist pack) which also contains the circulating pump.  This liner was found to be effective in preliminary tests on US Army Veteran amputees at Walter Reed. The initial product targets transtibial amputation, the most frequent form. There are approximately 350,000 transtibial amputees in the US who have prosthetic limbs and it is estimated that sales of the cooled prosthetic liner in this market have the potential to reach $25M/year or more at maximum penetration. Cool Stride was recently awarded $100,000 in funding from the Maryland Innovation Initiative to continue prototype development.  This team believes that the I-Corps program will allow the team to generate feedback from amputees, prosthetists, reimbursement and regulatory consultants on these, as well as yet unknown issues, regarding the proposed product.  The answers should help the team understand a) commercial potential; b) the need for minor or radical design changes; c) pricing structure; d) development and commercialization plan, and e) possible need to pivot towards a distinctly different product to solve amputee heat/sweat issues."

When it passes a given location, it typically causes a rainy period that lasts 15-30 days that is followed by dry weather, as well as an extended period of strong westerly winds.  The circulations that accompany the MJO go all the way around the world in the tropical atmosphere, and they affect when monsoon rainfall begins in Asia, Australia, and North America, as well as when and where tropical storms and hurricanes form.  Despite its importance to global weather and climate, the MJO has been poorly simulated in climate models for decades, so current predictions of how it will change in the future are unreliable.  <br/><br/>The scientists involved in this project have developed a new kind of weather model that better predicts the behavior of the MJO.  It is referred to as ""Lagrangian,"" because instead of solving equations for atmospheric motions on a grid of points, it tracks air masses as they move around the world. The Lagrangian weather model will be used to study how the MJO will change in the future as the oceans warm, and to better understand how the MJO works, so its representation can be improved in other models as well.<br/><br/>Uncertainty about future changes to the MJO represent an important X-factor for climate change.  Preliminary results suggest that the MJO will intensify, become more frequent, and affect a broader region of the tropics as the oceans warm.  Potential impacts include changes to tropical rainfall patterns, altered distributions of tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in wind patterns that favor more frequent and persistent El Nino-like ocean warming.  This project will also educate two graduate students and several undergraduate students about techniques in modeling atmospheric circulations and about climate dynamics."

Smaller eruptions followed until 70,000 years ago, and today, Yellowstone's volcanic system hosts a dynamic hydrothermal system with thousands of small magnitude earthquakes occurring annually. <br/><br/>In this project, a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oregon State University is deploying a network of sensitive magnetotelluric (MT) equipment, which record natural variations in Earth's geomagnetic and geoelectric fields, in and around Yellowstone National Park.  The team is using MT data to sense small changes in conductivity of the crust and mantle and, by combining MT and seismic measurements of the structure beneath Yellowstone, the team will infer the distribution of fluids in the magmatic system; how magma is stored at Yellowstone; and how mobile it is within the region. This has implications for future volcanic activity at Yellowstone and potential hazards such activity might pose.<br/><br/>This project is also fostering the career of principal investigator Ninfa Bennington, an early career female scientist, and involves field work by both graduate and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The team is creating outreach materials that will be shared with more than 40,000 people per year via interactive kiosks at the Geology Museum of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and is developing a smartphone app to share this content with an even broader audience.  In addition, they are working with Yellowstone National Park to create content detailing the field work carried out, and the results of the project, for the National Park Web site. These efforts will ensure the results from this project reach a wide audience.<br/><br/>Technical Description of Project<br/><br/>Previous seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) studies of the crust and upper mantle beneath Yellowstone (YS) have provided insight into the origin and migration of magmatic fluids into the YS crustal volcanic system. However, important questions remain concerning the generation of magmatism at YS and the migration and storage of these magmatic fluids within the crustal volcanic system.  The research team has developed three competing hypotheses describing active volcanism at YS, which include different explanations for: 1) the origin and location of magmatic fluids at upper mantle/lower crustal depths 2) the preferred path of migration for these magmatic fluids into the mid- to upper-crust, 3) the resulting distribution of the magma reservoir, 4) the composition of the magma reservoir, and 5) implications for future volcanism at YS. <br/><br/>To evaluate these hypotheses for active volcanism at YS, the team is conducting a high-resolution MT survey in the YS region, and is combining those observations with existing data to invert for the 3D resistivity structure in the crust and upper mantle underneath YS.  The team is also separately inverting seismic data to determine the seismic velocity structure in the same region using multi-scale techniques.  The resulting models are sensitive to different properties of the subsurface (e.g., MT to presence of melt and seismic velocity to increased temperature), and therefore provide independent structural constraints.  The team will combine these independent, spatially coincident models through joint interpretations test their hypotheses about the distribution and behavior of magmatic and related fluids in the Yellowstone magmatic system."

These rock walls then become unstable and can collapse in catastrophic landslides. In Alaska, where this phenomenon is increasingly common, landslides sometimes fall directly into the ocean and trigger a tsunami. This is what happened in October 2015 in the Taan Fiord: the largest rock avalanche in America in decades plunged 150 million tons of debris into the head of the fiord, producing a wave of water that ran 150m up the opposite bank and scoured the forested flanks of the fiord for at least 12km. The goal of the project is to collect observations of this Taan landslide and tsunami, and to deliver a benchmark dataset to the science and engineering communities so that they can better prepare for future disasters.<br/><br/>The project will combine satellite images, field observations and ship-based mapping to constrain the dynamics of the landslide and tsunami, including the mass and velocity of debris when it struck the water, the magnitude of tsunami wave generation and its pattern of motion, and the submarine flow of debris and its deposition. Data collection will take place in the summer of 2016 and will be delivered to the community by the winter."

Understanding the fate and transport of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles has been the focus of numerous studies over the past one decade. Efforts now also include understanding the interactions of nanoparticles with biota at different levels. Biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles have been studied widely in context of selected bacteria. In natural and engineered systems, along with prokaryotes, other tiny entities known as bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria only through their well-known lytic and lysogenic cycles. However, nothing is known about the effect of engineered nanoparticles on bacteriophages. The overarching goal of this Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to understand the effect of silver and titanium nanoparticles on the infectivity of bacteriophages. The project will use lytic phages specific for antibiotic resistant bacteria and will study the effect of silver and titanium nanoparticles on plaque formation, oxidation of protein coat forming the body of bacteriophages and attachment of nanoparticles to phage particles.  <br/><br/>The project has three distinct objectives; (1) Evaluate the interactions of silver and titanium NPs with bacteriophages isolated from natural ecosystems using microscopic techniques, (2)  evaluate the infectivity of lytic phages specific to pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria after these lytic phages are exposed to different types of NPs and, (3) formulate a mechanistic understanding using molecular modeling. <br/><br/>The results from this innovative research will establish a platform for advancing scientific knowledge in the area of nanoparticle-phage interactions. In addition, the outcomes of the proposed research will impact other disciplines such as environmental microbiology, aquatic toxicology and environmental nanoscience and engineering. For example, the results from this research may guide phage mediated drug delivery systems and enable more holistic approached for drug therapies to be developed. Also, sustainable approaches for environmental protection can also emanate from the results of this project if successful.  In the area of science education, the PI will: 1) integrate findings in his graduate and undergraduate courses, (2) incorporate this novel topic into an ongoing high school summer program in order to enhance high school laboratory research and (3) disseminate findings through conferences and peer reviewed journal articles."

Despite this hazard, there exist few methods for continuous monitoring or early warning of these destructive processes. One of the main issues in developing monitoring techniques is that floods and debris flows easily destroy any instruments placed in their path. This project aims to overcome this challenge by developing a methodology to measure and quantify the ground vibrations produced by water and debris flows, and thus be able to continuously monitor these hazards from a safe distance. <br/> <br/>To achieve the broader goal of developing a ground motion-based flood and debris flow monitoring framework, it is necessary to understand the mechanics through which these motions cause ground vibrations, and one specific goal of this project is to develop such a mechanistic understanding. In parallel with this model development, laboratory and field experiments are planned to test the assumptions of the theories and verify the accompanying hypotheses. This work is anticipated to result in new notions for how flows interact with their channels and allow quantitative remote monitoring to be possible."

When multiple versions of a message are to be written to a storage network, the project studies how to use erasure codes and distributed algorithms to tolerate communication and storage node failures and obtain consistent storage, while maintaining a low cost in terms of storage and communication sizes. Storing evolving information in a consistent way is one of the critical problems in multi-processor programming, sensor networks, distributed databases, and cloud storage. Schemes produced in this project seek solutions to reduce storage and communication cost, both in theory and in practical distributed systems. The project leverages coding theory and distributed computing, combined with information-theoretic and algorithmic arguments, of use in understanding other distributed algorithms as well. The project will educate students through research and graduate course development, and will provide online materials for a non-expert audience.<br/><br/>Under standard assumptions of coding for distributed storage, a static message is to be written and read, with the operations completed instantaneously. As a result, temporal aspects of the information access processes are not considered. On the other hand, shared memory in an asynchronous and unreliable message-passing network results in many read and write operations with delays that are not known a priori, and each write operation has a potentially different version of the dynamic message. An information-theoretic assessment of this setting is presently lacking. This project addresses several basic problems in storing evolving information in distributed networks. First, multi-version coding with a changing message is proposed. This is a new framework of error-correcting codes, which allows multiple versions of a message to be present in the storage network, and different subsets of versions to be written at different storage nodes, such that the newest possible version can be decoded despite node failures. Second, multi-version storage with synchronous communication is studied, where a possibly infinite series of write and read operations communicates to the storage nodes in synchronous rounds, such that every read can recover the newest possible message version.  Third, multi-version storage in asynchronous networks is studied, such that a write or a read can access the nodes many times and the decoded message version satisfy a given consistency condition. The project will study these different settings, construct achievable coding and algorithmic schemes, and prove information-theoretic outer bounds for the storage and communication cost."

Two specific models under consideration are: (1) Fluid-structure interaction (FSI), where the model consists of the Navier Stokes equation coupled on the interface with dynamic elasticity; and  (2) Structure acoustic interaction (SAI), in an acoustic chamber with an elastic or thermoelastic shell as a flexible wall. The SAI model consists of hybrid coupling between an acoustic wave equation and a shell equation which is possibly nonlinear. Control theoretic issues to be studied are: (a) stabilization, particularly stabilization of unstable equilibria in FSI and stabilization of SAI subject to weak dissipation; and (b) well-posedness, particularly seeking suitable feedback control such that the solution to FSI with moving interface is well-posed. Both models could be generalized to other structures where the developed mathematical technology could be applied to other coupled systems."

A challenge to eliminating these mistakes is the relative lack of empirical evidence regarding what secure coding practices  (e.g., secure defaults, validating client data, etc.), threat modeling, and educational solutions are effective in reducing the number of application-level vulnerabilities that software engineers produce. This research aims to perform experiments analyzing programming assignment submissions to Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) before and after secure coding and threat modeling techniques are taught to empirically measure their impact on the rate of security vulnerabilities in assignment implementations. A key component of this research will be the use of MOOC assignment specifications and variations that have the potential to be affected by common cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as problems with input validation to web applications or privilege escalation on mobile platforms. Because these critical security implementation issues will be known ahead of time, the MOOC assignments will allow automated assessment of how successfully each assignment implementation manages these security issues.<br/><br/>Key questions investigated by this research include analyzing the impact of varying secure coding and threat modeling techniques on vulnerability production in software, what level of abstraction these techniques need to be taught at to be effective, the relative return on investment of threat modeling vs. automated vulnerability assessment effort, and the comparative effectiveness of making developers aware of security issues versus requiring active application of secure coding and threat modeling techniques. The broader impact of this research is substantial. Very little empirical data is available for organizations to use to properly value the secure coding and threat modeling techniques that have been developed. By creating a large body of rigorous evidence to illustrate how effective (or possibly not effective) different techniques are, the research will allow organizations to evaluate their return on investment and improve the use of these techniques in the software engineering process."

Many areas of science now require computing with digital representations of the objects and systems being studied, but creating new research software to visualize and understand the data is a major bottleneck.  With new ways of volumetrically scanning specimens and increasingly nuanced models of dynamic systems, research software is becoming more complex, and the computational expense of running the software is significantly increasing.  Diderot addresses this urgent problem by simplifying the process of creating new parallel software to visualize and process complex scientific data.  The intellectual merits are how Diderot will accelerate expressing mathematical ideas in working code, expand the kinds of computational representations that Diderot understands, leverage the power of large supercomputers, and help programmers debug their programs.  The project's broader significance and importance are derived in part from the kinds of data that Diderot will handle, such as the high-resolution images produced by a microCT scanner at Argonne National Lab (used daily by scientists from all over the world), or the latest generation of light-sheet microscopes used in developmental biology to investigate fundamental questions about how cells organize themselves into tissues.  The project's significance also derives from the range of people who will use Diderot, from mathematicians writing specialized finite element method programs, to college students getting their first taste of scientific computation by working with real-world microscope data capturing the formation of the nervous system in a fish embryo.<br/><br/>Computation is an increasingly important tool for science, but the semantic gap between the available computational tools and scientific reasoning is often large.  One pressing research topic within computer science is how to create programming tools that can track the shift in parallel computing hardware from traditional general-purpose CPUs to heterogeneous processors with high-performance accelerators like GPUs.  This proposal seeks to accelerate research at the intersection of computation and science by exploiting domain-specific language (DSL) technology to bridge this semantic gap and to transform how scientists use software to understand data from measurement and simulation.  The PIs will build on the parallel DSL Diderot that they have designed.  Preliminary experience with Diderot demonstrates that it is possible to write visualization and analysis algorithms in a very mathematical programming notation that has performant parallel implementations on a variety of parallel hardware.  The project will build on these preliminary results in several ways: the PIs will extend Diderot to support a wider range of data models and to provide a richer set of computation tools for analyzing data; the PIs will work on scaling Diderot to handle larger data sets and larger parallel platforms; and the PIs will explore techniques and tools to better support domain-specific software development. These research thrusts will involve close collaboration between the areas of programming languages and image analysis. The design of language features will be driven by the needs of image analysis algorithms, as well as the foundational principles of programming languages. The design and implementation of Diderot will be evaluated using the latest image-analysis algorithms from the literature, as well as being used to prototype new algorithms."

These microbial communities influence the growth, reproduction, and death rates of their hosts. Not all microbes are detrimental; the effects of microbes span the full range from causing deadly disease to being essential for host health. Despite the importance of microbial diversity to host well-being, we have little ability to predict the diversity and composition of microbial communities within hosts. This project will address this knowledge gap by testing whether a mathematical model developed originally for plants and algae ('resource-ratio theory') can be used to understand what determines the diversity and composition of the microbes that inhabit plant hosts. The data from these experiments will be used to understand when the predictions of the resource-ratio model apply to microbial communities and how it can be modified to make better predictions. A deeper understanding of the controls on microbial diversity will lead to more accurate predictions about microbes within hosts, which may speed advances in medicine and agriculture.<br/><br/>The researchers will grow plants in conditions that vary in the supply of critical soil nutrients, and they will manipulate and measure the abundance and diversity of a group of plant viruses that cause one of the most widespread and devastating diseases of cereal crops worldwide (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses; B/CYDV's). Five B/CYD virus species will be used to test the resource-ratio model in a series of growth-chamber and field experiments. In each experiment, they will create a wide range of conditions experienced by the viruses by growing host plants under different resource (nitrogen and phosphorus) supply rates. The researchers will measure viral abundance (titer) within individuals, using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for each virus grown alone and in mixture. They will use viral abundance measurements through time to estimate virus population growth rates. The resource-ratio model will be tested with lab experiments, in order to predict viral diversity in each host. The resource-ratio model will also be modified to include elements of the virus and host biology that could cause deviations from the classic theory, such as host defences against infection by microbes and microbial effects on host nutrient content. To test the relevance of this model to more complex natural communities, the researchers will collect data on B/CYDV titers in field experiments replicated at a local field site and in 30 grasslands spanning 5 continents."

Most of these applications requires a sufficient THz light power density so that the light can pass through materials and able to be detected for analysis. This has fueled intense studies on the generation of high power THz light in the past decades. The recent demonstrated THz source based on nonlinear generation inside a mid-IR quantum cascade laser (QCL) is proved to be the only room temperature semiconductor light source that delivers mW-level power at room temperature in the 1-5 THz range. The main challenge for this type of sources is to generate higher THz power up to tens of milliwatts with good beam quality which is required by most of the real-world application. A novel approach is proposed to develop a chip-based THz source with high power output by extracting THz light from the entire cavity. This simple to use and compact source will be an enabling technology which will allow easy access to THz spectroscopy/ imaging for the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate a room temperature, monolithic THz source with sub-milliwatt level output power in continuous wave operation and tens of milliwatt level in pulsed mode operation. In the previous demonstrations, edge-emitting THz sources based on nonlinear generation inside a mid-IR QCL have limited outcoupling efficiency (~6-10%) due to the limited outcoupling aperture size regarding to the entire cavity. The approach in this proposed project is to use a surface-emission scheme based on THz diffraction grating defined in the semi-insulating InP substrate of a epi-down bonded THz QCL source for high-power and efficient THz outcoupling. Unlike the traditional distributed-feedback (DFB) grating which interacts with the guiding laser modes by providing the optical feedback, the proposed THz diffraction grating simply diffract the incident Cerenkov emission cone into the discrete directions. With an optimized grating structure, surface emission from the entire cavity with diffraction efficiency up to 90% is achievable. This will drastically increase the THz outcoupling efficiency and power. In contrast to a THz sources based gas lasers, which is bulky and expensive, the proposed THz QCL source offers a monolithic solution that, once developed, has potential for cost-effective mass production using the existing semiconductor laser fabrication infrastructure. This project is an excellent example of a multidisciplinary approach used to circumvent existing technological limitations. Solid state physics, material science, nonlinear optics, and laser physics are all major components of the research plan, which are all supported generally by NSF, and are used, in this case, together to combine multiple functional elements into a single, compact, high power device."

A key challenge in realizing such robots is programming them to meet the unique and changing needs of users and to robustly function in their unique environments.  Most research in robotics targets this challenge by attempting to develop universal or adaptive robotic capabilities.  This approach has had limited success because it is extremely difficult to anticipate all possible scenarios and use-cases for general-purpose robots.  Instead, this research aims to develop robots that can be programmed in-context and by end-users after they are deployed.  The PI's approach is to apply and extend methods from the broad research area of end-user programming, which has previously been limited to personal computers, smart phones, and Web applications, to programming robots.  Project outcomes will have long-term societal and economic impacts, particularly on individuals with varying levels of motor impairments.  To further broaden the impacts of this research, the project will involve several outreach and educational activities focused on broadening participation of women and individuals with disabilities in computer science education, research, and careers.  These activities will directly integrate tools developed in the project, within three educational outreach modules for K-12 students and one undergraduate course.  Outreach modules will target three venues with different time scales; a week-long summer camp for students with disabilities organized by the UW DO-IT center, a three-hour exercise for a ""Girls who Code"" field trip, and one-hour exercise for an ""Hour of Code"" event.  The Robotics Capstone course developed by the PI will be updated to integrate tools developed in this project and to focus on projects within assistive robotics with the involvement of an actual customer.  All tools will be implemented on a state-of-the-art mobile manipulator robot, PR2, and will be released as open-source projects.  A truly unique aspect of this research is that developed tools will be deployed on two privately-owned in-home PR2 robots, leading to first insights from real-world evaluations.<br/><br/>To achieve her goal the PI will address challenges related to distinct characteristics of robots including situatedness, ability to influence the environment, mobility, distributed concurrent processing, and overall complexity.  This research will produce a suite of new methods and tools within three programming paradigms: (i) ""situated programming"" which involves programming through direct interactions with the robot and its environment, (ii) ""simplified programming"" which involves actual programming but with highly simplified languages, and (iii) ""abstracted programming"" which involves manipulating abstractions of program entities for which programs are synthesized automatically.  All methods will be instantiated as tools for programming robots at multiple levels, including programming of new knowledge, skills, tasks, and rules.  The main objectives of the projects are to make these tools (i) expressive enough to capture useful real-world tasks, (ii) usable by people with no technical background, and (iii) accessible to people with diverse abilities.  The first objective will be evaluated through systematic experiments with a comprehensive user-centered benchmark for domestic assistive robots, including programming of tasks such as fetching, organizing, or preparing, and skills such as opening or closing cabinets, drawers, appliances, and faucets in different homes.  The second and third objectives will be evaluated through user studies with both able-bodied and motor-impaired individuals."

For each surgical trainee, a supervisor has to observe the trainees in person or look at recorded videos. This manual assessment of surgical skills poses a significant resource problem to medical schools and teaching hospitals and results in complications in scheduling/executing their day-to-day activities. In addition to the extensive time requirements, manual assessments are often subjective and domain experts do not always agree on the assessment scores. Every surgical resident has to master basic suturing and knot tying tasks before they can move on to more complex surgeries. Considering the burden on supervising surgery faculty from performing actual surgeries and the amount of trainees that need to go through basic surgical skills training, a system for automated assessment of basic surgical tasks can benefit medical schools and teaching hospitals.<br/><br/>The project addresses the potential commercialization of a system for automated assessment of basic surgical skills. The system consists of a central station with user interface and specialized instruments and gloves for the user. Data about movement of the gloves and instruments are captured using accelerometers and transmitted wirelessly to the central station. Using machine learning, the data will be processed and compared to the performance of a skilled surgeon on the same task. Based on that analysis, a score on the surgical skill will be displayed for the user. The users will be able to keep track of their previously obtained scores, which will allow them to see their progress over time. This will also be beneficial for the supervising surgeon who can monitor trainees' skill improvement before allowing them to move on to more complex procedures. Having such a system available in teaching hospitals and medical schools could help teaching surgeons save valuable time that they could spend doing more surgeries and also give students more opportunities for valuable feedback. This could result in a higher patient throughput for hospitals and improve the overall healthcare system. Through NSF I-Corps, the team will conduct interviews with expert surgeons and residents from different teaching hospitals to validate the need for an automated system for grading. Moreover, the team will also conduct interviews with people in dentistry to see if the proposed technology can be used in their domain as well.

Metamaterials are man-made materials which possess unusual characteristics, stemming from the optimal design of their internal architecture. Metamaterials have applications in a broad range of areas including the automotive, aerospace, and heavy machinery industry. For example, when inserted into a building, this project's metamaterial is capable of absorbing most of the vibration energy produced by ground shaking during an earthquake and releasing stresses from structural elements, thus preventing structural damages. Produced through a low-cost manufacturing process, this metamaterial is an affordable technology that will raise the seismic protection of new and existing structures to levels so far achieved only in critical buildings and infrastructure. Building owners will benefit from the use of this technology in terms of enhanced safety, reduced repair costs, and extended operability after earthquakes. Large-scale use of this technology will enable communities to become more resilient to earthquakes and reduce social and economic impacts of seismic events in the US and worldwide. <br/><br/>Metamaterials are typically assembled from composite materials such as plastic and metal to achieve enhanced material properties. However, this team's technology relies on a metamaterial manufactured from off-the-shelf steel components using high temperature brazing to achieve desirable design requirements at a reduced cost. A layered periodic assembly of unit cells made of shells, plates, and bearing cores is used to mimic rubber-like flexibility, with augmented energy dissipation capability through hysteretic deformation of the shells. The metamaterial properties can be fine-tuned for specific applications through optimization of a variety of design parameters, including constitutive material properties, geometry, number, and spacing of the shells, size and geometry of the bearing cores. Availability of a low-cost enhanced seismic protection technology in the construction market has the potential of fostering the application of enhanced seismic protection systems. This will reduce individual and community indirect losses after major seismic events. NSF Innovation Corps Teams Program (I-Corps Teams) resources will provide insight, through customer interviews of the viability of this seismic technology in the marketplace, information regarding desired requirements, funds for technology development, and a transition plan for commercializing the technology."

In the case of coastal Alaska over the past several thousand years, the available data indicate that for the most part, the answer has been ?not much? ? the marine ecosystem seems to have remained relatively stable, even through periods of climate change such as the Medieval Warm Period and the so-called ?Little Ice Age? The one exception to this generalization is found on Unalaska Island, in the eastern Aleutians. At about 4000 years ago, ringed seals, which are an ice-adapted species, made up a significant portion of the subsistence base. This suggests that temperatures were substantially colder than they are today. However, many of the species that are common in the area today (in the absence of significant levels of sea ice) were also an important part of the subsistence economy 4000 years ago.  <br/><br/>Our research aims to try to address this apparent contradiction?was it cold and icy? Or was it generally more temperate, much as it is today? To do so, we will (a) study the growth patterns and shell chemistry of modern and archaeological butter clams, which will give us an indication of what the water conditions were like. We will also (b) conduct a detailed analysis of all of the species present in the archaeological midden sites, including the age composition of what was being harvested, as an indication of what the environmental conditions were like. And, finally, we will (c) conduct a detailed analysis of the artifacts associated with marine mammal hunting to determine the likelihood that hunters 4000 years ago developed a specialized toolkit for hunting in the sea ice.<br/><br/>As coastal communities throughout the Arctic face important decisions regarding the possibility of major climate change, the research team believes that it will be important to have some ?test cases? that provide information on how various communities have responded to climate change in the past. The archaeological sites on Unalaska Island provide nearly 4000 years worth of data of adaptation to past climate change; data that are directly relevant to understanding the challenges of future climate change.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of Late Holocene climate change on animal biodiversity and human foraging activity in Alaska?s Aleutian Islands. This three-year, interdisciplinary study will use zooarchaeological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in Late Holocene climate significantly affected local environments, ecosystems, and human hunting strategy in the eastern Aleutian Islands. This interdisciplinary project will apply models of human foraging behavior to research human-animal-environmental interactions in the context of climate change using three major lines of evidence: 1) growth patterns and stable oxygen isotopes in archaeological shellfish will be used to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; 2) archaeological faunal material from several taxonomic groups will be used to test whether animal distribution and behavior have changed through time in response to changes in climate; 3) artifacts will be analyzed to look for adaptations to the marine mammal hunting toolkit in response to changes in climate and resource availability. More specifically, the research team proposes a research program that will use multiple datasets from Unalaska Island to address whether sea ice and ice-loving (?pagophilic?) fauna were present in this region during the Neoglacial phase, suggesting a dramatic change in prehistoric climate. The interdisciplinary nature of archaeology makes it uniquely positioned to accomplish two things: 1) to offer truly long term data about the ecological, climate, and resource histories for the Gulf of Alaska, data that are vital to understanding both ancient and contemporary human and environmental interaction in this region and 2) to collaborate with local Native Alaskan communities and students, resource managers, and cultural resource managers to collect, interpret, and disseminate the data and findings."

DH is a dental condition that inflicts severe pain in majority of people sometime during their lifetime. The currently available products attempt only to treat the symptoms temporarily, and there is no lasting cure of the problem. This project focuses on nano-macro porous glass fabrication technology and applying a new class of bioactive materials to the regeneration of dental tissue. The resulting glasses, which have tailored amorphous multiporous (TAMP) structure, promote the growth of bone as well as soft tissue.  The project will result in new TAMP compositions and establish their potential for the regeneration of damaged dentin and pulp tissue to cure DH. The selected TAMP powders that comprise of interconnected nano-macro porosity, which can be tailored to desired surface area, have the unique potential to cure the problem at its source. Consequently, when placed inside the body, a TAMP powder of appropriate composition can supply therapeutic ions in a controlled manner, providing a microenvironment that is expected to occlude dentin tubules to stop the painful symptoms more effectively than currently available products. More importantly, the new TAMP powders are also expected to stimulate tissue regeneration by the cells for a lasting cure. In contrast, the present products in this market space, available over the counter or by prescription, make no attempt to regenerate damaged tissue.  <br/><br/>The project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. A simple TAMP powder based on calcium silicate has shown proliferation of bone forming cells in laboratory tests and also regeneration of bone and soft tissue regeneration under in vivo tests in animals. However, a demonstration of its ability to regenerate dental tissue (dentin and pulp) has been lacking. The project attempts to obtain evidence for the therapeutic capabilities of TAMP powder for dental tissue regeneration, and thereafter prepare it for clinical trials. It is also developing new compositions that combine the benefits of different treatments in one product. For example, novel TAMP powders with fluoride, zinc and potassium ions embedded within the molecular structure of silicate glass are being fabricated, to provide a lasting supply of fluoride ions at the site of DH, zinc ions that promote regeneration, and potassium ions that desensitize pain-sensing nerves. Further, tests are being performed to assess in vitro differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, and in vivo formation of pulp-dentin complex on TAMP silicates implanted in a mouse model. With this knowledge compositions are optimized for more adherent and faster developing occlusion layer as well as pulp-dentin tissue regeneration.<br/><br/>This technology translation from research discovery toward commercial reality is a team effort led by a glass scientist who developed the TAMP fabrication technology portfolio under prior NSF supported research, together with an endodontist with expertise in dental tissue regeneration, a cell biologist with expertise in cell response to TAMP materials, and a healthcare industry expert with experience in the early stage commercialization of biomedical products. During its course the project is directly training three graduate students in use-inspired research and practical problem-solving through a cross-disciplinary approach that combines materials engineering, cell biology and dental science. The combination of innovative TAMP technology and its potential societal impact has drawn much general student interest, which will be further expanded through more definitive results of this project."

The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response requested that the Institute of Medicine establish a rapid and agile process for convening subject matter experts to address adverse health effects of medical and public health emergencies and disasters when they occur. The goal of the process is to prioritize scientific research needs in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. This will culminate in a summary report of the strategic science questions most relevant to promote a better response, recovery, or enhanced resilience in the affected community. Environmental engineers and scientists play an important role in disaster response as noted is several recent situations such as the Elk River (Charleston, West Virginia) chemical spill, the Dan River (North Carolina) coal ash spill, and the lead and microbiological contaminated drinking water in the Flint River (Flint, Michigan).<br/><br/>The Institute of Medicine will convene an ad-hoc committee whose composition would vary based on the nature of the emergency/disaster. The committee could include experts in public health, epidemiology, environmental health, first responders, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, nursing, emergency management, bioethics, medical countermeasures, state and local government, operations research national civic organizations, and risk communication. The process convened by the Institute of Medicine would also provide a connection to the local communities affected by the disaster by including important stakeholders such as non-government funders or other organizations. The committee will identify fast track-activities required to assist with evolving public health emergencies and disasters. The process will provide a venue for on-going communication among the medical and public health communities, as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in planning and response activities. The Institute of Medicine would assist in the planning and development of related ad hoc activities undertaken by separately appointed committees as appropriate. The process would be triggered by a large scale disaster event, at the request of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and may be initiated in the affected locality. In addition, the committee will formulate a strategic report of scientific priorities, gaps, recommended prospective studies, or recommended or required administrative infrastructural support of such science. Further, as needed, the standing committee will be involved in the planning, development, and oversight of related fast-track ad hoc activities undertaken by separately appointed committees operating under its auspices that will be able to help prioritize scientific research needs during a public health event or in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The Standing Committee on Medical and Public Health Research During Large-Scale Emergency Events will coordinate with units across the National Academies to provide a venue for discussion of issues related to short- and long-term strategic planning. The committee will provide a venue for a dialog between the federal, state, and local governments, the private sector, academic community, other research funders, as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and emergency response services."

Collectively this group designs and fields a large sample survey of at least 50,000 American adults. The survey measures demographics, political opinions and attitudes, and electoral behavior, especially in the congressional elections, but also in the Presidential election and state elections.  The very large sample size allows researchers to have sufficient data to study state electorates as well as the entire nation.  The survey is used to study who votes and why, and what explains the choices that voters make.   The CCES, which started in 2006, makes available at very low cost a survey platform that is open to all.   Since its inception, the project has involved more than 100 different research teams and hundreds of faculty and student researchers, and it has conducted interviews with over 250,000 American adults. The survey helps to create and sustain a network of researchers interested in state and national elections, survey design, and public opinion.  <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey is developed by a consortium of research teams.   Each research team that wishes to be involved in the project purchases a 1,000-person sample survey from the same firm.  Each individual team determines half of the questions on its survey. The other half of the content (Common Content) is created by a design committee, drawn from the participating teams.  Common Content consists of questions that every team would like to measure or questions that are of broad interest and require a very large sample.  The project, thus, fields as many surveys as there are teams and also produces a single large sample survey that consists of the Common Content.   The Common Content is designed by a committee in consultation with all teams involved in the survey.  The survey will be fielded over the Internet, with samples constructed to be nationally representative.  Each team will receive the data from its own 1,000-person survey and a dataset consisting of the 50,000+ observations from the Common Content survey.  Survey data are validated using voter validation and through comparisons of state level election results to the survey results from the subsamples for each state. The data produced by this project will be a 2016 Common Content dataset, along with accompanying contextual data, as well as separate Team Content datasets and will be available on the CCES Dataverse website."

The type of data that researchers have at their disposal to aid in this task is increasingly rich and complex.  While these increased data resources open up many new opportunities, they also pose additional challenges as researchers must employ data-reduction techniques - for example, techniques from the analysis of ""big data"" - to make analyzing complex data and models feasible and informative, and naïve application of such techniques may render conclusions drawn about economic effects invalid.  This research project will establish a general, formal framework to provide guidance about construction of estimation and inference devices coupled with appropriate use of tools from ""big data"" or data-mining that will deliver reliable conclusions about economic objects of interest.  The proposed research will present the methods and corresponding theoretic guarantees to cover a variety of situations encountered in empirical research in economics and the social sciences, offer empirical applications, and provide usable software in statistical packages popular within the social sciences.  The theoretical and empirical work will thus help bridge the gap between social science practice and ""big data"", and will provide methods that will enhance the credibility of the drawn scientific conclusions.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will provide bridges between high-dimensional statistical modeling and applied social science research.  Integrating high-dimensional methods with economically relevant modeling frameworks and targets is important in providing researchers tools which can be used to analyze modern, complex data and provide reliable inferential statements about the objects of interest.  The proposed research will advance the theory of inference following regularization which is a key element to inference in modern, large data sets.  The main goal of this research project is to generalize available results about inference for a low-dimensional target parameter of interest by providing an encompassing framework that will include interesting nonlinear models and estimation procedures such as maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments.  We will also provide an extension to cover cases where the target of interest is function valued, such as when interest is in a set quantile treatment effects across a range of quantile indices.  This advancement will expand the frontier for applications of high-dimensional methods in applications where inference about sets of model parameters is the goal.  This expansion is useful even in low-dimensional models and is likely to become crucial as large, complicated data sets become more readily available.  In addition to providing theoretical results, the research aims to provide illustrative empirical examples and software in both R and Stata for application of these methods."

This study will examine a past major extinction of megafauna in order to understand the cascading effects on ecosystems. About 13,000 years ago many species of large mammals in the Americas became extinct. This research will examine the consequences of the loss of these large carnivores and herbivores from the food web to the remaining plant and animal communities. The responses seen at this long-ago event will be used to develop general concepts relevant to modern-day changes in plant and animal communities. This project will also make fossil data more easily accessible and interpretable, will improve museum collections, and will inform the public through outreach activities conducted by the Smithsonian Institution. This work will also provide graduate and undergraduate students with research experience that will strengthen the scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The consequences of the loss of tens of millions of large-bodied mammals about 13,000 years ago on the structure and functioning of ecosystems in the Americas will be examined in order to address four questions: How did the extinction of large-bodied mammals influence overall community structure and species interactions at the terminal Pleistocene; Did surviving species become more abundant or change their geographic distribution; What changes in morphology, if any, occurred in species that survived the extinction; Did surviving species alter their dietary niche in response to the extinction of megafauna? Patterns of abundance, distribution, diet and morphology in the surviving mammals both before and after the extinction event will be characterized. Using occurrence information from fossil database compilations, morphology and size will be determined by measuring fossil limbs and molars, and diet by using stable isotope analysis. These data will be integrated with reconstructions of vegetative communities using pollen databases and regional and global temperature records. An important ecological baseline for the understanding of contemporary trophic downgrading will be established by characterizing how terrestrial ecosystems were influenced by humans at an important point in human history."

However, many existing models for studying incipient social complexity overlook crucial variation in societies whose changing social-political order cannot readily be characterized as more or less hierarchical (e.g., when communities seem to be changing in composition, but not with evidence of increasing inequality.) Additionally, climatic instability and a changing resource base are frequently identified as factors contributing to social upheaval and reorganization. These issues have relevance to our own society, and examination can contribute to an understanding of the ways in which individuals in a society can react to and gird against dramatic ecological and environmental changes. How does resource scarcity or unpredictability affect community organization? And why does social inequality, as in this particular case study, not arise where we might expect it to? Archaeology in general, and this project specifically, is uniquely positioned to address these questions. Excavations for this project will be conducted at a site that has been subject to looting; this project will illustrate that looted sites can still be informative to researchers and should remain subject to protection. Community outreach in the form of talks and presentations to emphasize the importance of respecting and protecting local archaeological resources are a key part of this project. <br/><br/>Dr. Gregory D. Wilson and Jenna K. Santy, of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), will investigate changes in social organization during two periods of pre-Columbian occupation in Owens Valley, in eastern California. During a time period when known changes occurred (such as the introduction of the bow and arrow, the introduction and spread of pottery, dramatic shifts in food resources, and increasing climatic instability), how was small-scale, village-level social organization changing as well? Using household-level data, obtained by excavation supported by  NSF but also from existing, un-analyzed collections, this project will investigate how individual household subsistence strategies compared to neighboring households, and will assess how space was used and organized differently. Spatial analyses include a method using chemical-isotopic levels in soil as a proxy for activity areas, as certain activities (such as eating and food processing) leave traces in soil visible long after the activities occurred. This project will also assess where certain features of village life were located: where were cooking and storage activities taking place? Inside the house, away from the eyes of others in the village? Or in open space, suggesting a communal orientation? Excavation will be carried out by undergraduate and graduate student volunteers, who will be trained in field methods as part of this project."

Current interface modalities such as video, keyboard, tactile, audio, and speech can all contribute to an HRI interface. However, an emerging area is the use of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for communication and information exchange between humans and robots. BCIs can provide another channel of communication with more direct access to physiological changes in the brain. BCIs vary widely in their capabilities, particularly with respect to spatial resolution, temporal resolution and noise. This project is aimed at exploring the use of multimodal BCIs for HRI. Multimodal BCIs, also referred to as hybrid BCIs (hBCI), have been shown to improve performance over single modality interfaces. This project is focused on using a novel suite of sensors (Electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, pupillary size, computer vision, and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)) to improve current HRI systems. Each of these sensing modalities can reinforce and complement each other, and when used together, can address a major shortcoming of current BCIs which is the determination of the user state or situational awareness (SA). SA is a necessary component of any complex interaction between agents, as each agent has its own expectations and assumptions about the environment. Traditional BCI systems have difficulty recognizing state and context, and accordingly can become confusing and unreliable. This project will develop techniques to recognize state from multiple modalities, and will also allow the robot and human to learn about each other's state and expectations using the hBCI we are developing. The goal is to build a usable hBCI for real physical robot environments, with noise, real-time constraints, and added complexity.<br/><br/>The technical contributions of this project include:<br/>1. Characterization of a novel hBCI interface for visual recognition and labeling tasks with real physical data and environments.<br/>2. Integration of fNIRS sensing with EEG and other modalities in human robot interaction tasks. We will test our ability in the temporal domain to determine at what timescale we can correctly classify movement components that would predict a correct (rewarding) trial or non-rewarding/incorrect movement.<br/>3. Analysis and validation of the hBCI in complex robotic tele-operation tasks with human subject operators such as open door, grasp object on table, pick up item off floor etc.<br/>4. Use of hBCI to characterize human/robot state and create a learning method to recognize state over time.<br/>5. Use of augmented reality for HRI decision making.<br/>6. Further develop hBCI for tracking cognitive states related to reward, motivation, attention and value.<br/>A new class of HRI interfaces will be developed that can expand the ability of humans to work with robots; promote the use and acceptance of robot agent systems in everyday life; expand the use of hBCIs in areas other than robotics for human-machine interaction; further the development of hBCIs as our system will be tapping into reward modulated activity that will be used via reinforcement learning to autonomously update the learning machinery; and bridge the educational divide between Engineering/Computer Science and Neuroscience."

These monkeys are currently experiencing the environmental effects of a strong El Niño climate pattern. The opportunity to study a well-monitored monkey population during a stress event (El Niño) that affects all individuals is rare.

This event presents the opportunity to test whether elevated glucocorticoids increase or decrease survival in wild capuchin monkeys subjected to a catastrophic stressor that affects all individuals. Longitudinal behavioral and fitness data and fecal measures of glucocorticoids will allow for an individual-level approach, correction for several other variables known to affect glucocorticoids in wild primates, consideration of past and present hormone levels for the same individual and in comparison with others, and assessment of infant mortality and maternal hormone levels."

More effective tests can detect more potential bugs and thus help prevent economic loss or even physical damage caused by software bugs. Therefore, a huge body of research efforts have been dedicated to test effectiveness evaluation during the past decades. Recently, mutation testing, a powerful methodology that computes the detection rate of artificially injected bugs to measure test effectiveness, is drawing more and more attention from both the academia and industry. Various studies have shown that artificial bugs generated by mutation testing are close to real bugs, demonstrating mutation testing effectiveness in test effectiveness evaluation. However, a major obstacle for mutation testing is the efficiency problem ? mutation testing requires the execution of each artificial buggy version (i.e., mutant) to check whether the test suite can detect that bug, and which is extremely time consuming. Therefore, a light-weight but precise technique for measuring test effectiveness is highly desirable.<br/><br/>The approach is to automatically extract test effectiveness information (e.g., mutation testing results) from various open-source projects  to directly predict the test effectiveness of the current project without any mutant execution. More specifically, the PI proposes to design a general classification framework based on a suite of static and dynamic features collected according to the PIE theory of fault detection. Furthermore, this research will explore judicious applications of advanced program analysis, machine learning, and software mining techniques for more powerful feature collection, more active learning, as well as more comprehensive training data preparation. The proposed approach will result in efficient but precise test effectiveness evaluation for projects developed using various programming languages and test paradigms, which is crucial for high-quality software. Furthermore, the training of the classification models will require to collect various basic testing, analysis, and mining information from a huge number of open-source projects, and thus may also benefit a large variety of software testing/analysis/mining  techniques that explore open-source software repositories."

Similar to glass lenses, which focus light, these devices allow for focusing or otherwise manipulating radio and microwaves. In particular, devices with spatially varying magnetic and dielectric properties offer exciting and innumerate possibilities for electromagnetic wave shaping but remain to be realized due to lack of practical fabrication techniques. Inkjet printing provides a promising approach to manufacturing such devices: inks of different composition (e.g., containing magnetic and dielectric nanoparticles) can be dispensed in varying ratio within the volume of the device to implement the desired spatial gradient in magneto dielectric properties. The goal of this industry university collaboration is to demonstrate devices, fabricated by 3D inkjet printing, with tailor-made spatial variation in magnetic and dielectric properties to achieve wave shaping as needed by a given application. The demonstration will pave the way for advanced devices such as antenna lenses that beam radio or microwave signals only to a specific WiFi enabled machine or within the perimeter of a specific room to mitigate the risk of signal interference or interception. The project will also create a unique educational and professional development opportunity for participating students, who will acquire expertise and industry experience, via internships, in advanced manufacturing, an area of significant economic importance to the U.S. Further, in partnership with a local library, talks aimed at public education in 3D printing technologies will be presented. <br/><br/>This collaborative GOALI project seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of microwave and radio frequency magneto-dielectric devices, with specifically designed, spatially varying electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The project will combine transformation optics techniques for design of electromagnetic media with 3D inkjet printing for digitally directed device fabrication. Graded index microwave lens antennas, with individually customized radiation patterns, will be printed in proof of concept. The devices will be printed in a layer-by-layer sequence with polymerizable inks containing high permeability magnetic and high permittivity dielectric nanoparticles. A key challenge, due to particle loading constraints when jetting inks, will be attaining the requisite range of permeability and permittivity in the printed composite medium. Inks formulated with commercial nanoparticles will be used to conduct a rapid survey of electromagnetic properties possible in the composites. The results of the survey will guide subsequent ink design with custom nanoparticles. The size, dispersion and loading of the nanoparticles in the inks will be optimized for ink-jettability and range of electromagnetic properties achieved in the printed composites."

These communication systems make use of direct contact between neighboring cells through specific nanometer-scale organization and presentation of cell surface receptors and ligands. This project will use a unique molecular engineering tool, termed DNA origami (or DNA folding), to determine how genes that control the production of proteins on the outer membranes of cells (major histocompatibility complex or MHC) interact with T-cell receptors (TCR).   The interaction of the MHC and the TCR is the first step in the T-cell activation process, which impacts important biomedical issues in normal immune function, cancer, and autoimmune disease.  Thus, the work in this proposal has the potential to enable a powerful toolkit for performing fundamental biological studies on receptor dynamics and developing therapies for immunological disorders.   <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to employ the rich palette of molecular engineering tools provided by structural DNA nanotechnology to specifically organize, orient, and present biologically active molecules to living cells in order to understand, facilitate, interrupt, and reprogram molecular interactions involved in cell signaling.  Complex webs of cell signaling pathways make up the cell-to-cell communication networks responsible for everything from homeostasis, to wound healing, to development, and to immunity. These communication systems often make use of direct contact between neighboring cells via specific nanometer-scale organization and presentation of cell surface receptors and ligands they interact with.  Specifically, the project will examine the spacing and multiplicity of presentation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and its interaction with T-cell receptors (TCR) on the surfaces of living cells. The interaction of MHC and TCR is the first step in the complex biochemical cascade involving T-cell activation that impacts important biomedical issues in normal immune function, cancer, and autoimmune disease. DNA origami, a subset of DNA nanotechnology, will be assembled with designed architectures, patterns, and structural reinforcement in order to test a range of hypotheses in cell signaling science that would be very difficult or impossible to test by other, less programmable experimental methods.  Novel basic science can now be pursued as well as testing of possible therapeutic strategies using DNA origami molecular assemblies displaying proteins, ligands, receptors, aptamers, small molecules, and other cell effectors. The combination of well-engineered experimental set-ups for probing individual cell-cell interactions allied with the programmable molecular recognition platforms of DNA-based nanostructures represents a new intellectual frontier with significant long-term potential in understanding biology and affecting human health. The program will lead to development of naturally biocompatible molecular organizers for a variety of biological and biomedical applications. Results from this study may provide major advances in understanding important events in T-cell activation and in cell-to-cell communications in general. Future extensions of this project could involve application of molecular materials and methods developed here toward other cell signaling pathways critical to understanding and improving human health. Graduate students will gain valuable opportunities for education and research training. The PI has consistently involved undergraduate, high school, and under-represented students in research programs and will redouble efforts to do so on this project"

The books engage children and their families in learning about the earth's ecosystems through narratives that reflect the research conducted at Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. This project will strengthen and advance the LTER 'schoolyard' book series by completing production of three additional books and by expanding the publication formats of all 12 books to include both eBooks and interactive ePub3 versions. Selected books will be translated into Spanish. Authors and the publisher will work closely with the LTER Communications Office to increase the profile of the book series and to develop a rich resource of materials that can be used by educators throughout the US. <br/><br/>The science theme underlying the narrative of each children's book is a topic investigated by LTER researchers; it uses this approach to engage young children from a broad range of backgrounds. This approach is based on an understanding of how children perceive their local environment and encourages young children to develop empathy for the ecosystem in which they live. This empathy can then lead to greater interest in learning more about their own local environments, progressing to interest in other more distant environments as a student matures. This modest award will advance the LTER schoolyard book series in three distinct ways. First, three books currently in development will be completed, bringing to 12 the number of children's books available. The books will represent half of the active LTER projects, bringing knowledge of diverse ecosystems to middle school students. Second, the investigator will develop a formal assessment of the success of the books as educational tools, including their relationship to new science standards. Third, the lead investigator will work with authors, Taylor Trade Publishers, and the LTER Communications Office to develop a business plan for future publications. In the composite these three goals will strengthen an educational book series that has already proved both popular and effective."

Interest in such systems stems from their technological promise and fundamental physical properties. The goal of the project is to resolve one of the central challenges of theoretical chemistry: accurate prediction of the electronic properties of nanoscale systems and their response to external perturbations. This can lead to an understanding of such devices at the molecular level with predictive theory. The results are central in developing memory and logic molecular devices, molecule-based sensors, photovoltaics for solar conversion and new types of electronics.  The ability of the research to interconnect different scientific communities allows students involved in the project to participate in a flexible curriculum, thus preparing them to work in either fundamental or applied sciences, in academy or in national labs, in one of the fields or at interfaces of many-body theory, molecular spectroscopy, and computational quantum chemistry.<br/><br/>Theoretical simulations of nanoscale open non-equilibrium systems mostly employ single-particle basis functions (e.g. orbitals as in the non-equilibrium Green function density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) approach). These approaches allow treatment of systems of realistic sizes, but become inconvenient in treating strong intra-system interactions. An alternative approach, the non-equilibrium atomic limit (e.g. the pseudoparticle (PP) or Hubbard NEGF), utilizes many-body states of the isolated system as a basis, which allows accounting for the system interactions. The applicability of such formulations is limited to relatively small systems. The project develops a methodology, the non-equilibrium divide-and-conquer method, which capitalizes on the strong sides of both methodologies: the NEGF-DFT ability to treat big systems and the PP and Hubbard NEGF ability to account for strong local interactions exactly. Partitioning of the original system (either in real or state space) is utilized with the parts treated by either single-particle or many-body states approaches. This extends the usual divide-and-conquer methodology to the realm of open non-equilibrium quantum systems.  The results are central in developing memory and logic molecular devices, molecule-based sensors, photovoltaics for solar conversion and new types of electronics."

When it passes a given location, it typically causes a rainy period that lasts 15-30 days that is followed by dry weather, as well as an extended period of strong westerly winds.  The circulations that accompany the MJO go all the way around the world in the tropical atmosphere, and they affect when monsoon rainfall begins in Asia, Australia, and North America, as well as when and where tropical storms and hurricanes form.  Despite its importance to global weather and climate, the MJO has been poorly simulated in climate models for decades, so current predictions of how it will change in the future are unreliable.  <br/><br/>The scientists involved in this project have developed a new kind of weather model that better predicts the behavior of the MJO.  It is referred to as ""Lagrangian,"" because instead of solving equations for atmospheric motions on a grid of points, it tracks air masses as they move around the world. The Lagrangian weather model will be used to study how the MJO will change in the future as the oceans warm, and to better understand how the MJO works, so its representation can be improved in other models as well.<br/><br/>Uncertainty about future changes to the MJO represent an important X-factor for climate change.  Preliminary results suggest that the MJO will intensify, become more frequent, and affect a broader region of the tropics as the oceans warm.  Potential impacts include changes to tropical rainfall patterns, altered distributions of tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in wind patterns that favor more frequent and persistent El Nino-like ocean warming.  This project will also educate two graduate students and several undergraduate students about techniques in modeling atmospheric circulations and about climate dynamics."

On land, networks of instruments are available to measure the build-up of strain across the Cascadia subduction zone fault. Similar observations are required offshore to understand the dynamics of the subduction zone better, and to place stronger constraints on the earthquakes and tsunamis the fault produces every few hundred years.  This project uses calibrated seafloor pressure sensors to make accurate measurements of the elevation of the seafloor at six sites off the coast of central Oregon.  The project will initiate a decadal study that will measure changes in seafloor elevation that result from the build-up, and potentially the release, of strain across the subduction zone fault.  The study will constrain the width of the locked portion of the fault that will break in the next large subduction zone earthquake. The project will involve two graduate students, and include at least four undergraduates on each research expedition.<br/><br/>High-quality offshore vertical geodetic measurements will be used to provide a baseline suitable for resolving secular strain caused by locking across the Cascadia subduction zone, and for detecting slow slip events. Several previous studies have shown that seafloor pressure measurements can detect slow-slip events, but the drift of seafloor pressure sensors has limited their application to measuring secular strain. The University of Washington (UW) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) have collaborated to build and successfully test a campaign version of the SIO seafloor calibrated pressure recorder, the Absolute Seafloor Calibrated Pressure Recorder (ASCPR).  This instrument measures absolute pressures to an accuracy equivalent to ~1 cm of water depth.  Repeat measurements with the ASCPR on stable seafloor benchmarks equipped with a continuously recording bottom pressure gauge will be used to remove the drift from pressure time series and enable measurements of secular strain. The UW and SIO have deployed a trench-perpendicular profile of 6 benchmarks and bottom pressure recorders off central Oregon. This project supports repeat campaign-style absolute pressure measurements over two years on each benchmark to fully characterize the repeatability of ASCPR measurements and initiate a decadal study required to measure secular strain. By utilizing stable, undisturbed benchmarks to make accurate absolute pressure measurements, this effort could transform our capabilities for making long-term geodetic observations offshore. Complementary geodetic and physical oceanographic modeling studies are being used to further understand the expected geodetic signals and develop improved methods to separate geodetic and oceanographic components of pressure."

This dissertation will contribute to public debate about appropriate pay levels for CEOs by putting the rising demand for ""superstar"" CEOs into historical context. The research investigates an understudied mechanism contributing to rising executive compensation: the rise in outside CEO hires at large U.S. firms since the middle of the 20th century. The percentage of new CEOs hired from outside the company (rather than promoted from within) more than doubled from 1970 to 2005, and evidence suggests that this upward trend is even starker if the entire post-WWII period is considered. CEOs hired from outside the company tend to have higher compensation than those promoted from within, and hence this rise in outside hires is linked to surging executive pay. To help explain this shift towards outside CEO hires, this dissertation will (1) better document when and in which industries outside CEO hires first became common and (2) investigate how evaluations of these outside hires by the business community have changed since the middle of the 20th century. <br/><br/>Many explanations of the steep rise in executive compensation since the 1970s rely on the existence of an external market for CEOs. This external CEO market has expanded dramatically over the past half-century, and this dissertation will investigate the shift towards outside CEO hires among publicly traded firms in the United States. Prior accounts of the emergence of an external CEO market treat outside CEO hires as a stable phenomenon rather than a practice whose meaning has changed and whose acceptance needs to be explained. Many explanations highlight the economic changes that arose in the 1980s, but the pre-1980s period is rarely studied as a comparison case. The research design of this dissertation will address these shortcomings to provide a more compelling account of the shift towards outside CEO hires.  The study will (1) construct a data set of CEO successions at 500 large, publicly traded U.S. firms from 1950 to 2015 and (2) use content analysis of newspaper articles and analyst reports to inspect how evaluations of outside CEO hires have changed over time. In addition to clarifying explanations of rising CEO pay, this research will help explain how a value for general management skills became institutionalized in practice, granting those seen to possess these skills with the flexibility to reap greater rewards in the labor market."

As a vital nutrient, the availability of nitrogen in a biologically usable form often ""limits"" the growth of plants both on land as well as in the ocean.  Paradoxically, nitrogen is very abundant as dinitrogen gas (N2) in both the Earth's atmosphere and dissolved in seawater.  However in this chemical form, nitrogen cannot be used by most living things.  Only a small subset of microbes has the ability to ""fix"" N2 gas, that is, to convert it into a biologically usable chemical form.  Thus, these N2 fixing organisms provide a critical environmental function sustaining life on this planet.  In the ocean, N2 fixation is a major control on the total amount of biologically available nitrogen, balancing over the time losses back to N2 gas.  The amount of biologically available nitrogen in turn controls the growth (productivity) of photosynthetic organisms (phytoplankton) in the sunlit region of the surface ocean which form the base of the food chain and contribute to oceanic control of the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. <br/><br/>This project concerns itself with understanding the fundamental, large-scale controls of oceanic N2 fixation and how they are influenced by climate change over time.  N2 fixing microbes themselves appeared to be limited by the availability of other nutrient elements such as phosphorous and iron.  While it is known in which parts of the ocean there is at present greater or lesser availability of phosphorous and iron, it remains unclear if either is of overriding importance or if changes in the past produced significant variations in N2 fixation.  Past changes in N2 fixation may have been an important feedback on oceanic control of atmospheric greenhouse gases.  Understanding these past changes and their controls will provide the knowledge base for improving prediction of how ocean N2 fixation may respond to future changes in climate. This is of great societal relevance as changes in oceanic N2 fixation will ultimately impact marine ecosystems and living resources as feedback on the greenhouse gases driving climate change.<br/><br/>To address these questions, the research team will undertake a study the climate-sensitivity of N2 fixation in the southeast Pacific gyre over the last glacial cycle as well as its plausible ""master controls"". This oligotrophic region experiences little modern N2 fixation despite proximity to a large supply of excess phosphate from the adjacent Peru-Chile oxygen minimum zone. This is consistent with modern iron limitation due to low aeolian supply that would have been relieved during past dusty conditions. The research team will use the natural experiment of the last full glacial cycle, captured in the foraminiferal-bound N isotopes of gyre sites as well as sites at its southern margin, to probe controls on the marine N cycle exerted by variable dust inputs and changes in N-loss in the adjacent oxygen minimum zone, and relate these to known changes in greenhouse forcing of climate. Through numerical modeling, the research team will also consider whether past variations in N2 fixation in this region may have impacted the global ocean N cycle and budget. <br/><br/>This project will also fund the training of undergraduate and graduate students and support participation of high school students from underrepresented groups in original research.  The research team will continue their outreach efforts through established partnerships with elementary, middle, and high schools, engaging a diverse school population and their families with exciting and relevant science."

Today, scientific data is collected from a vast array of sensors: satellite images and radar, neuro-imaging, microscopes, body monitoring, socio-economic indicators, to name just a few. While models and theories were traditionally derived via careful handcrafting by domain experts, the new data deluge makes direct human analysis impossible. We need intelligent machines that can process vast amounts of sensory data into interpretable quantities that provide actionable information. This project will develop machines that will be able to learn on their own, purely from experience, produce and test hypotheses on causes and effects in complex dynamic scenes, and better collaborate with human scientists and analysts. For generality, we will develop and test our theory in two different domains. Amongst the immediate benefits of our project are methods for discovering the causal relationship between genes, brains and behavior. <br/><br/><br/>Our objective is to develop theory and practical algorithms for automatically interpreting a dynamic scene containing interacting agents. This will involve automatically identifying the main spatial locations, the objects, the actors, their actions and goals, and their relations to one another. The output is a description of the events, and hypotheses on the actors? goals, cause-effect relationships and likely developments. The key technical questions that we will tackle are how to infer semantically meaningful ""macro"" variables (i.e. agents' role and goals, actions, objects, special locations) directly from raw sensory data (mostly video), how to infer the causal relationships among such variables, and how to adaptively plan new experiments, including collecting feedback from human experts, to resolve ambiguities in the model.  The intellectual merit of our project lies in developing an end-to-end, pixels-to-causes approach to the automatic analysis of dynamic scenes. To this end, we will integrate, build upon, and transcend the capabilities of extant ""low-level"" correlational machine learning and ""high-level"" causal inference approaches, combined with interactive learning approaches to sequential experimental design."

During doctor visits, women's urine samples are tested for urinary infections, proteins (one symptom of preeclampsia), glucose levels, and a number of other parameters. These results are combined with blood pressure, weight gains, other blood test results, the ultrasound, and any general conditions and pregnancy related complaints.  This information is used to determine if the pregnancy is low- or high-risk. In the case of a high-risk pregnancy, careful monitoring is required, more tests are ordered, doctor visits occur more often, and hospitalization is sometimes required. Limited access to prenatal care, because of its high cost or unavailability, means that large segments of the population do not go to doctors and do not have access to any of required tests. For such women, there may be undetected pregnancy complications and an impact on morbidity and mortality. For all pregnant women, there is a need for a low cost, portable system that can be used at home, to assist in self-monitoring of prenatal conditions and detection of the complications associated with high risk pregnancies.  This I-Corps team proposes a low cost, mobile phone based system to identify these complications that require professional medical assistance.<br/><br/>This team's  mobile phone based system can be used for the detection of prenatal complications including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and urinary infections. It combines urinalysis results from a mobile dipstick reader with other important patient information, and automates this complex diagnostic process.

The current system consists of a mobile phone, a low cost 3D-printed attachment (to hold the sample in place and provide a controlled amount of light for the camera), integrated with custom software. Based on the outcomes of the I-Corps program, the team plans to choose a customer segment and adjust the product according to their value propositions. The first option is the medical community, which would use the device for patient testing and diagnosis. The second option is individual women, who would use the device at home to assess their own needs and possibly reduce anxiety during pregnancy."

Operators have relied on similar scale-out network fabrics (typically folded-Clos topologies) to construct their networks.  Since their deployment in the mid-2000s, these scale-out designs have leveraged the steadily increasing performance and decreasing cost of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based switching silicon to keep pace with demand.  Unfortunately, these trends cannot continue: network switches face the same CMOS process-scaling limitations that currently hamper central processing unit (CPU) manufacturers.  Just as CPUs have moved to multi-core designs to side-step their scaling limitations, so too will data center operators need to adopt alternative architectures to scale to next-generation link rates.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate a hybrid electrical/optical nework topology, called SelectorNet, which scales to hundreds of thousands of servers at link rates reaching 1.6 terabits per second.  Unlike recent proposals which utilize two dimensional- or three-dimensional microelectromechanical systems (2D or 3D-MEMS) optical crossbar switches, SelectorNet relies on a novel optical device that abandons the crossbar abstraction. Instead, it relies on indirection to deliver packets between hosts that are not directly connected by our novel ""selector"" switches.  The result is a network fabric that is not only cost-competitive with state-of-the-art Clos-based designs in 2020, but continues to scale in terms of cost, energy, performance, and reliability as link rates surpass 400 gigabits per second.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Ensuring that the benefits of this work have impact beyond the traditional metrics of research is integral to its design.  The results of this research will make it easier to design and build scalable, efficient, and highly-available cloud and data center services.  By reducing the cost to deploy cloud infrastructure, the researchers hope to lower costs for the largest operators, while reducing the barrier to entry of the cloud for smaller organizations.  They will further expand the research skills of graduate and undergraduate students to address necessary datacenter efficiency and cloud computing research challenges in a hands-on manner.  Exposing undergraduate students to cloud computing technologies in their courses and through mentored research will enhance their marketability at graduation and has the potential to inspire their curiosity and encourage the pursuit of graduate studies.  Teaching students how to build state-of-the-art networked systems that are grounded in rigorous analysis and practical constraints is essential in our increasingly networked world.

Urban planners often confront competing interests of different constituent groups in their efforts to balance the need to modernize infrastructures with fostering of employment for the urban poor. Conversions of garbage dumps to modern sanitary landfills, for example, may reduce hazards to public health at the same time they threaten the livelihoods of thousands of people who rely on waste picking and recycling for survival. The contestations that take place over the right to the dump cut to the heart of urban citizenship and the poor's rights to the city and public space. This project will investigate how various stakeholder groups differently understand and value waste infrastructures and evaluate the labor implications of upgrades to sanitation facilities. In so doing, it will advance understanding of the infrastructure planning process, urban citizenship, and the means through which the urban poor contest projects that threaten their livelihoods. Research results will have valuable implications for planners, policymakers, and social justice advocates addressing the challenges posed by infrastructure modernization in cities of the Global South.  <br/> <br/>This project focuses on a case study of a planned sanitation upgrade that has spawned an organized protest movement by waste pickers in Dakar, Senegal. Dakar is an ideal setting for this research because of its long history of peaceful, multi-party democracy, its long tradition of urban citizenship movements, and recent trends to ""clean up"" undesirable places and informal laborers. Dakar's sprawling dump, Mbeubeuss, is one of the oldest and largest landfills in Africa.  Though the government plan to upgrade the infrastructure has been frustrated over the last few years by protests, under pressure from its funder the World Bank, efforts are underway to push the upgrade forward in the next two years.  Through ethnographic research with key stakeholders, including government planners and waste pickers, the research will examine the planning process during this time as a window into material struggles around urban citizenship and the rights of the city's poorest. Extensive interviews, participant observation, and participatory mapping will be conducted in order to reveal the different spatial and material relations represented by the two infrastructures, how actors' contested visions for the dump are embedded in their material practices (e.g. recycling processes versus office work), and the forms of expert and vernacular knowledge marshaled by each group.  Special attention will be paid to the way that picker activists contest the authoritative knowledge of planning through their alternative development discourses and practices of civic science.  Contributing to debates in political infrastructures, geographies of waste, urban political ecology, and the politics of environmental knowledge, the research will show the material basis of urban citizenship and lend insight into strategies for more pro-poor infrastructure planning."

Many of these children remain undiagnosed until their symptoms are evident. The delayed diagnosis decreases their chances of overcoming their disabilities and precludes early intervention, which results in large increases in cost of care for these patients over their lifetime. Early MRI imaging of the brain provides a path towards timely diagnosis. However, diagnosis of these disorders via visual inspection of images - the current standard of care - is difficult and time consuming, and may miss subtle but crucial brain changes. Furthermore, diagnosis often requires a highly specialized and experienced pediatric neuroradiologist, a skill not always present in many hospitals. There are no clinical decision support tools to quantitatively evaluate changes in the brain to increase efficiency of interpretation, facilitate uniform interpretation regardless of radiologist experience level and enable earlier diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic interventions. This project's technology, ""Click Brain"", provides a diagnostic ""fingerprint"" for neurological disorders such as microcephaly, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. It is more efficient (quicker and earlier diagnosis) with higher reproducibility than current qualitative visual examination of the images.<br/><br/>Click Brain is automated, quantitative Clinical Decision Support software that can assess clinically relevant parameters such as: head circumference, total white matter volume, total gray matter volume, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volume and shape of subcortical structures. Click Brain can also significantly impact patient care by 1) increasing efficiency of interpretation and reporting, 2) promoting more uniform interpretation independent of radiologist experience level, 3) enabling earlier diagnosis, 4) providing data for quantitative longitudinal studies for treatment monitoring, and 5) reducing the impact and cost of developmental disorders. For the customer discovery phase of the I-Corps program, the team will primarily target the following potential customers:  Radiologists/neurologists/neurosurgeons to understand how the software could have most impact in terms of disorders and output measurements, and to determine the best way to integrate the software into clinician workflow; Hospital administrators to optimize the team's commercialization strategy; Medical schools to understand the potential market in medical student education; and Pharmaceutical company project managers to determine how Click Brain can help with drug trials."

With the participation of hundreds of microbiology faculty across the country, the ASM published the ASM Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology (Merkel et al., 2012) - a comprehensive set of six core concepts and 27 fundamental statements based on Vision and Change. College instructors often struggle to determine if altering teaching methods actually leads to increased student learning. This is where the development of concept inventories can be helpful.  Concept inventories are assessments that specifically address core concepts in a particular discipline. They are typically multiple choice instruments that use commonly held misconceptions as distractors. In support of innovation in undergraduate biology education, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established three committees to construct, review, validate and disseminate two different concept inventories. One concept inventory focuses on core microbiology concepts taught in general microbiology for microbiology majors. The second concept inventory is focused on health sciences general microbiology concepts. The third committee's charge is the independent review of both of the concept inventories. <br/><br/>Developing and validating a concept inventory is time intensive and requires a great deal of collaboration among faculty experts. This ASM Microbiology Concept Inventory Conference is bringing together these three teams now that they have completed their initial work (which has taken place using virtual meeting formats whenever there has been a need to meet). The project is nearing the stage of development where face-to-face discussion and planning are necessary. The two-day conference will allow a focused review of the work that has been completed. At this conference, researchers will present and discuss the preliminary data from the formal review as well as the initial statistical analysis from the early in-class trials for both concept inventories. Conference attendees will review each concept inventory for potential gaps and write new questions as needed to fill those gaps. Once completed, these concept inventories will be useful tools that will be available to hundreds of microbiology faculty teaching tens of thousands of microbiology students. Concept inventories that can accurately and reliably measure student learning gains can be widely used by faculty teaching microbiology. Lastly, the concept inventory teams will discuss and determine the best mechanism to both store and disseminate the completed concept inventories once they are validated after statistical analysis of each question after the concept inventories have been used on a larger, nationwide scale."

With the striking advancement of modern data-collection methods, complex and massive data sets are generated from various sources and contexts that are conceptually connected.  This promises to provide a better understanding of complex social and behavioral phenomena, but it also presents significant challenges for the integration and interpretation of data from multiple sources. The general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model will improve understanding of complex social and behavioral phenomena ranging from violations of rational decision theory to social survey data integration and interpretation.  This project is part of a larger research program to build probabilistic and dynamic systems for social and behavioral sciences from quantum rather than classical probability principles.  The project will develop and disseminate from public repositories self-contained software packages for applying and estimating the general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model in MATLAB, R, and Python.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and test the general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model, including the development of the mathematical theory of the model and related statistical and computational tools for applying the model. They will rigorously test the model using a large range of experiments. When large data sets are collected from different contexts or conditions, often they can be summarized by contingency tables. A critical problem arises, however, regarding how to integrate and synthesize these tables into a compressed, coherent, and interpretable representation. A common solution is to try to construct a joint probability distribution to reproduce the frequency data observed in the tables. Bayesian causal networks then are often used to reduce the number of estimated parameters by imposing conditional independence assumptions. In many cases, however, no such joint distribution exists that can reproduce the observed tables. The general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model provides a promising solution to the problems faced by complex and massive data by constructing a single finite state vector that lies within a low dimensional Hilbert space and by forming a set of non-commuting measurement operators that represent the measurements. In this way, the model produces a compressed, coherent, and interpretable representation of the measured variables that form the complex collection of data tables even when no standard joint distribution exists."

Smaller eruptions followed until 70,000 years ago, and today, Yellowstone's volcanic system hosts a dynamic hydrothermal system with thousands of small magnitude earthquakes occurring annually. <br/><br/>In this project, a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oregon State University is deploying a network of sensitive magnetotelluric (MT) equipment, which record natural variations in Earth's geomagnetic and geoelectric fields, in and around Yellowstone National Park.  The team is using MT data to sense small changes in conductivity of the crust and mantle and, by combining MT and seismic measurements of the structure beneath Yellowstone, the team will infer the distribution of fluids in the magmatic system; how magma is stored at Yellowstone; and how mobile it is within the region. This has implications for future volcanic activity at Yellowstone and potential hazards such activity might pose.<br/><br/>This project is also fostering the career of principal investigator Ninfa Bennington, an early career female scientist, and involves field work by both graduate and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The team is creating outreach materials that will be shared with more than 40,000 people per year via interactive kiosks at the Geology Museum of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and is developing a smartphone app to share this content with an even broader audience.  In addition, they are working with Yellowstone National Park to create content detailing the field work carried out, and the results of the project, for the National Park Web site. These efforts will ensure the results from this project reach a wide audience.<br/><br/>Technical Description of Project<br/><br/>Previous seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) studies of the crust and upper mantle beneath Yellowstone (YS) have provided insight into the origin and migration of magmatic fluids into the YS crustal volcanic system. However, important questions remain concerning the generation of magmatism at YS and the migration and storage of these magmatic fluids within the crustal volcanic system.  The research team has developed three competing hypotheses describing active volcanism at YS, which include different explanations for: 1) the origin and location of magmatic fluids at upper mantle/lower crustal depths 2) the preferred path of migration for these magmatic fluids into the mid- to upper-crust, 3) the resulting distribution of the magma reservoir, 4) the composition of the magma reservoir, and 5) implications for future volcanism at YS. <br/><br/>To evaluate these hypotheses for active volcanism at YS, the team is conducting a high-resolution MT survey in the YS region, and is combining those observations with existing data to invert for the 3D resistivity structure in the crust and upper mantle underneath YS.  The team is also separately inverting seismic data to determine the seismic velocity structure in the same region using multi-scale techniques.  The resulting models are sensitive to different properties of the subsurface (e.g., MT to presence of melt and seismic velocity to increased temperature), and therefore provide independent structural constraints.  The team will combine these independent, spatially coincident models through joint interpretations test their hypotheses about the distribution and behavior of magmatic and related fluids in the Yellowstone magmatic system."

The type of data that researchers use for this task becomes increasingly rich and complex.  While these increased data resources open up many new opportunities, they also pose additional challenges, and naïve application of such techniques may render conclusions drawn about economic effects invalid.  This research project will establish a general, formal framework to provide guidance about construction of estimation and inference devices coupled with appropriate use of tools from ""big data"" or data-mining that will deliver reliable conclusions about economic objects of interest.  The proposed research will present the methods and corresponding theoretic guarantees to cover a variety of situations encountered in empirical research in economics and the social sciences, offer empirical applications, and provide usable software in statistical packages popular within the social sciences.  The theoretical and empirical work will thus help bridge the gap between social science practice and ""big data"", and will provide methods that will enhance the credibility of the drawn scientific conclusions.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will provide bridges between high-dimensional statistical modeling and applied social science research.  Integrating high-dimensional methods with economically relevant modeling frameworks and targets is important in providing researchers tools which can be used to analyze modern, complex data and provide reliable inferential statements about the objects of interest.  The proposed research will advance the theory of inference following regularization which is a key element to inference in modern, large data sets.  The main goal of this research project is to generalize available results about inference for a low-dimensional target parameter of interest by providing an encompassing framework that will include interesting nonlinear models and estimation procedures such as maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments.  The investigators will also provide an extension to cover cases where the target of interest is function valued, such as when interest is in a set quantile treatment effects across a range of quantile indices.  This advancement will expand the frontier for applications of high-dimensional methods in applications where inference about sets of model parameters is the goal.  This expansion is useful even in low-dimensional models and is likely to become crucial as large, complicated data sets become more readily available.  In addition to providing theoretical results, the research aims to provide illustrative empirical examples and software in both R and Stata for application of these methods."

Potential applications of this framework include improving interventions for diseases (e.g. individualized responses for HIV patients), and improving our understanding of which gene regions are responsible for long-term survival in harsh environments. The framework will be publicly available in standalone computer software that can be run on small computers or large computing clusters.

The data will be genomic sequences which are known to contain technical errors; to successfully differentiate among gene regions that are under selection for particular environments, these errors must be taken into account, but currently are not. Additionally, samples from different geographical locations (for example different patients, different islands, or different habitats) can be grouped in different ways, which requires that the framework be capable of delivering optimality criteria that help to order different scenarios.

Consequently, the use of recycled unbound material has become widespread. In recent years, there has been substantial increase in the use of aggregate produced from recycling crushed concrete (referred as recycled concrete aggregate - RCA) in civil engineering applications to reduce production costs, construction time, and engage in sustainable practices. With increased usage, the physical, mechanical, and environmental properties of RCA have been widely investigated to support its suitability for using it as backfill or structural fill in variety of geotechnical applications. Despite previous research, the potential of precipitating calcareous material (in particular, deposition of calcite) from RCA leachate is not well understood. Not understanding this behavior may lead to unintended consequences based on incorrect use, inappropriate design, or unnecessary limitations especially in underdrain stormwater systems. For example, when stormwater systems are designed with natural soils/aggregates, they are primarily evaluated against the physical clogging of the geotextile filter. However with RCA, evaluating the physical clogging alone is not sufficient as this phenomenon is based on migration of fine particles and does not describe the potential of precipitating calcite from RCA. The main objective of this research is to investigate and understand the chemical phenomena leading to calcite precipitation and crystal growth within geotextile media from RCA under conditions similar to underdrain stormwater systems. <br/><br/>This is a one-year exploratory experimental research program to examine the suitability of existing calcite precipitation rate models, and theoretical calcite crystal growth kinetics models in natural waters. The objective is to quantify and predict the calcite precipitation occurrence in RCA. An attempt will be made to answer questions regarding (1) precipitation of calcite crystals over geotextile; (2) approximation of the kinetics of calcite precipitation from RCA using the mechanistic PWP model; (3) quantifying the difference between physical and chemical clogging phenomena; and (4) defining the degree in reduction in serviceability of geotextile based on coupling the effects of both chemical and physical clogging phenomena. The findings from this exploratory research will also identify the complexities that may require further, longer, and more in-depth investigation for a follow-up research program. The outcome of this research will yield transformative knowledge in terms of (1) understanding the chemical phenomenon and (2) differentiating between physical and chemical clogging of underdrain stormwater systems with geotextiles constructed alongside RCA."

These shape-transforming objects go through changes in shape, such as shrinking and expanding, which would make the shape better at performing its function. Shape-changing structures may add value to existing products and may enable new ones. As an example, a shape-transforming car bumper may be better in car crashes. These bumpers would increase the durability of car, because damage would be immediately fixable by the driver, giving lower or no replacement costs. In the event of a small accident, using a shape-changing bumper could avoid having to replace the whole bumper. This would make the automotive industry more efficient due to fewer junked cars and parts. Furthermore, the lower cost, time, and effort of fixing a car would increase customer satisfaction. Another possibility may be shape-transforming architectural design of homes. In particular, changeable roof heights can be designed to adapt to seasonal changes. In the summer, roofs could expand to increase airflow; whereas, a lower ceiling would maximize heat efficiency during the winter. This project will help better understand how to adapt the proposed technologies to specific customer's needs and expectations. <br/><br/>The project will involve at least 100 interviews with potential customers and partners. This I-Corps team will identify potential customers for the shape-morphing structures and learn in detail their specific needs and wants, so as to have an accurate understanding of the value proposition that the team can provide its customers. This activity will improve the team's understanding of delivery channels and how to cultivate customer relationships.  The team will also learn how to approach potential customers, and to develop custom products that meet their specific needs. The I-Corps training will help the team ground their new technology in real-world challenges and opportunities. Because this team has both long and short term objectives, the team will follow a barbell approach in which they target 50% of resources and interviews towards the development of a single short-term product that seems to be low risk and could have immediate viability. Simultaneously, the team would invest 50% of its resources on interviews and customer discovery related to a diverse array of longer term, riskier and perhaps more profitable applications."

Although the gases are compressed under high pressure into the gas cylinders, the gas storage capacity by such traditional methods are typically not high. Furthermore, the high pressure might also have some safety concerns. Materials with higher gas storage capabilities can not only increase the gas storage amount within fixed cylinder spaces, but also reduce the storage pressure for gas storage and, thus, improve safety concerns. This project explores the market potential of porous metal-organic framework (MOF) materials for industrial gas storage and separation, particularly methane and acetylene storage, and separation of acetylene/ethylene. Through the implementation of new materials for the high capacity storage of natural gas and acetylene for the future vehicles, it reduces the United States' heavy dependence on the gasoline energy resource and diminishes the environmental side effect of carbon dioxide emission from the combustion of high carbon hydrocarbons.<br/><br/>Porous MOF materials are very promising adsorbents which can be filled into gas cylinders to significantly enhance the gas storage capacities. The tunable pores and functional sites within porous MOFs have also enabled these porous materials to be very useful for gas separations.  This team will conduct customer discovery during the 7-week I-Corps program to assess the industrial customers' real needs in terms of gas storage and separation, and the target market size. Following completion of the I-Corps curriculum, the team will decide whether or not to establish a start-up company and to continue its commercialization efforts through SBIR and/or STTR funding."

The new observations by the NST are expected to extend the frontier of existing knowledge on the energy release process of flares and its impact on the deep solar atmosphere in terms of both positive and negative contrasts.  The observational results will also be compared with numerical simulations in order to have a more complete physical understanding of the observed phenomena.  NSF has made significant investment in supporting the BBSO's facilities in the past, in particular the NST, which has been transited from commissioning phase to operations, thus enabling routine high-quality observations of the Sun.<br/><br/>This comparative investigation in solar flare phenomena will enable a quantitative analysis of the energy release processes that occur not only on the Sun, but also elsewhere in the solar system and stars.  Solar flares are one of the key sources of space weather, which causes adverse impacts on the Earth and its environment.  Advanced understanding of the solar flare phenomenon helps improve forecasts of space weather events at their onset.<br/><br/>This research project has a strong educational component; it will support a female Ph.D. student and a junior researcher at the NJIT.  The studies will provide a comprehensive training for the student in taking observations at the BBSO, data processing and understanding the principals of flare heating models.  Therefore, the project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research."

With the striking advancement of modern data-collection methods, complex and massive data sets are generated from various sources and contexts that are conceptually connected.  This promises to provide a better understanding of complex social and behavioral phenomena, but it also presents significant challenges for the integration and interpretation of data from multiple sources. The general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model will improve understanding of complex social and behavioral phenomena ranging from violations of rational decision theory to social survey data integration and interpretation.  This project is part of a larger research program to build probabilistic and dynamic systems for social and behavioral sciences from quantum rather than classical probability principles.  The project will develop and disseminate from public repositories self-contained software packages for applying and estimating the general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model in MATLAB, R, and Python.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and test the general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model, including the development of the mathematical theory of the model and related statistical and computational tools for applying the model. They will rigorously test the model using a large range of experiments. When large data sets are collected from different contexts or conditions, often they can be summarized by contingency tables. A critical problem arises, however, regarding how to integrate and synthesize these tables into a compressed, coherent, and interpretable representation. A common solution is to try to construct a joint probability distribution to reproduce the frequency data observed in the tables. Bayesian causal networks then are often used to reduce the number of estimated parameters by imposing conditional independence assumptions. In many cases, however, no such joint distribution exists that can reproduce the observed tables. The general Hilbert space multi-dimensional model provides a promising solution to the problems faced by complex and massive data by constructing a single finite state vector that lies within a low dimensional Hilbert space and by forming a set of non-commuting measurement operators that represent the measurements. In this way, the model produces a compressed, coherent, and interpretable representation of the measured variables that form the complex collection of data tables even when no standard joint distribution exists."

Drug screening programs in the 1950s tested single compounds on multiple cancers in heterogeneous patient samples. Yet in the decades that followed the first chemotherapy trials, researchers turned to studies of narrow subcategories of cancer (e.g. metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women) to test complex therapies involving surgery, radiotherapy and drug combinations. The shift between these research designs, that are practically mirror images of one another, poses puzzling questions: How has cancer research shifted its structure and orientation? How and when did 'cancer' stop being a meaningful clinical unit? How did multiple cancer diagnoses emerge and come to replace it?<br/><br/>This project examines the structuring of cancer research to explain the multiplication of cancer diagnoses. The researchers hypothesize that the effort to improve anticancer drugs through clinical trials was a mechanism for creating new diagnoses. The introduction of statistical expertise pressured cancer scientists to homogenize patient samples so that they could compare treatment and control groups that were as similar as possible. This compelled researchers to narrow down trials' recruitment criteria and to transform diagnostic schemes. The study examines whether prognostic variables used in clinical trials to predict patients' responses to treatment turned into refined recruitment criteria in subsequent trials and were eventually translated into new diagnoses. The increasing specification of diagnosis limited patient pools and slowed down the recruitment of patients that met inclusion criteria. The researchers thus also hypothesize that diagnosis specification increased the collaboration between institutions that could recruit patients, reinforced the need for standardization and sophisticated statistical tools, allowing researchers to conduct multicenter trials and to work with small patient samples, and reinforced specialization in oncology. The researchers conduct comprehensive archival research and analyze materials from all major institutions involved in cancer research: The National Cancer Institute, The Food and Drug Administration, Medicare, Cooperative Research Groups from across the U.S, The U.S. National Library of Medicine and The Mary Lasker Paper Collection.<br/><br/>This project offers an important contribution both to sociology of diagnosis and to sociology of standardization and evidence-based-medicine. Sociology of diagnosis asks how are new diagnoses created. The researchers suggest a novel mechanism that drives the creation of diagnoses. That is, medical drugs create opportunities and incentives to develop new diagnoses not only through pharmaceutical marketing and through medicalization of previously non-medical conditions, but also that drugs function to extract data that serve to split up patient populations and existing diagnoses. Sociology of evidence-based-medicine asks how clinical trials became the 'gold standard' of biomedicine. This project suggests that the endogenous effects of clinical trials acted to reinforce trials' golden status by fragmenting diagnosis clinical trials restructured cancer research and reinforced the need for standardization and statistical expertise. This study also offers a critical contribution to the understanding of how scientific procedures (homogenization) interact with exclusion and with disparities in the production of medical knowledge about different population groups."

In the case of coastal Alaska over the past several thousand years, the available data indicate that for the most part, the answer has been ?not much? ? the marine ecosystem seems to have remained relatively stable, even through periods of climate change such as the Medieval Warm Period and the so-called Little Ice Age. The one exception to this generalization is found on Unalaska Island, in the eastern Aleutians. At about 4000 years ago, ringed seals, which are an ice-adapted species, made up a significant portion of the subsistence base. This suggests that temperatures were substantially colder than they are today. However, many of the species that are common in the area today (in the absence of significant levels of sea ice) were also an important part of the subsistence economy 4000 years ago.  <br/><br/>Our research aims to try to address this apparent contradiction?was it cold and icy? Or was it generally more temperate, much as it is today? To do so, we will (a) study the growth patterns and shell chemistry of modern and archaeological butter clams, which will give us an indication of what the water conditions were like. We will also (b) conduct a detailed analysis of all of the species present in the archaeological midden sites, including the age composition of what was being harvested, as an indication of what the environmental conditions were like. And, finally, we will (c) conduct a detailed analysis of the artifacts associated with marine mammal hunting to determine the likelihood that hunters 4000 years ago developed a specialized toolkit for hunting in the sea ice.<br/><br/>As coastal communities throughout the Arctic face important decisions regarding the possibility of major climate change, the research team believes that it will be important to have some ?test cases? that provide information on how various communities have responded to climate change in the past. The archaeological sites on Unalaska Island provide nearly 4000 years worth of data of adaptation to past climate change; data that are directly relevant to understanding the challenges of future climate change.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of Late Holocene climate change on animal biodiversity and human foraging activity in Alaska?s Aleutian Islands. This three-year, interdisciplinary study will use zooarchaeological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in Late Holocene climate significantly affected local environments, ecosystems, and human hunting strategy in the eastern Aleutian Islands. This interdisciplinary project will apply models of human foraging behavior to research human-animal-environmental interactions in the context of climate change using three major lines of evidence: 1) growth patterns and stable oxygen isotopes in archaeological shellfish will be used to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; 2) archaeological faunal material from several taxonomic groups will be used to test whether animal distribution and behavior have changed through time in response to changes in climate; 3) artifacts will be analyzed to look for adaptations to the marine mammal hunting toolkit in response to changes in climate and resource availability. More specifically, the research team proposes a research program that will use multiple datasets from Unalaska Island to address whether sea ice and ice-loving (?pagophilic?) fauna were present in this region during the Neoglacial phase, suggesting a dramatic change in prehistoric climate. The interdisciplinary nature of archaeology makes it uniquely positioned to accomplish two things: 1) to offer truly long term data about the ecological, climate, and resource histories for the Gulf of Alaska, data that are vital to understanding both ancient and contemporary human and environmental interaction in this region and 2) to collaborate with local Native Alaskan communities and students, resource managers, and cultural resource managers to collect, interpret, and disseminate the data and findings."

In the last 15 years, dense Global Positioning System (GPS) and earthquake observations made at subduction zones have revealed a new style of fault slip.  In addition to continuous slip and sudden earthquake motion, many faults experience slow slip. In some instances, a relationship between slow slip and damaging large earthquakes has been observed. Most observations of slow slip occur at 20-40 km depth below the seafloor.  At the Hikurangi margin offshore of New Zealand, slow slip also occurs at shallow depths, but detailed investigation of shallow slow slip has been hampered by the lack of suitable seafloor observations. Understanding the extent, distribution, and range of physical conditions for shallow slow slip events is important, especially since the shallow fault interface is where tsunamis are generated by earthquakes. This project uses recently collected ocean bottom seismic and absolute pressure gauge data from the Hikurangi margin to investigate the relationship between earthquake and slow slip and the physical conditions that favor them. Results of this research will be incorporated into an earthquake science course for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science program for high school students at the University of California-Santa Cruz.  This project involves the mentoring and training of three graduate students and two to four undergraduate interns, including at least one from an underrepresented group in the Earth Sciences. All students will benefit by receiving training from researchers at different institutions.<br/><br/>A large shallow slow slip event occurred in October 2014, directly beneath the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip instrument array, a major U.S. led international experiment with Japanese and New Zealand researchers.  The experiment was designed to investigate the physical environment that hosts shallow slow slip and its relationship to destructive, seismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction thrust.  This project will build on the initial data analysis from this experiment to tackle four main objectives: 1) to improve initial tremor and earthquake detection and location using the PageRank technique and matched filtering cross correlation, 2) to investigate changes in coulomb failure stress imparted on the megathrust from the 2014 slow slip event and compare it to earthquake and tremor locations to test whether static stress changes can explain their location, 3) to determine earthquake source parameters and explore their spatial and temporal relationships with slow slip, geodetic coupling and physical properties of the plate interface and 4) to improve images of seismic velocity and attenuation structure using body wave velocity and attenuation tomography and ambient noise surface wave tomography.  This project will complement similar efforts in Cascadia and Japan, allowing comparison of the properties and environment of shallow and deep slow slip and build a detailed picture of the relationship between seismic and aseismic slip and its dependence on the velocity and attenuation structure."

In non-democracies, law is often applied selectively or subjectively. Where cases are non-political, there is some expectation that courts will fulfill their intended functions. However, if cases are political, informal influence is assumed to prevail. The PI examines this puzzle through analysis of the emergence, litigation and resolution of land disputes in Kazakhstan.

Firms in this sector of the economy develop expertise that allows them to participate in markets with limited (asymmetric) information.  For example, a mortgage company must assess the credit-worthiness of potential borrowers. Property insurers evaluate the chance of damage from natural disasters. Venture capitalists decide whether or not to invest in a start-up business.  Developing expertise is expensive; it takes time and effort. Expertise is valuable to the individual firm, since more expertise means better decisions and eventually higher returns. Expertise is also valuable to the wider society as a whole.  Society is better off when credit-worthy people can get mortgages (but very risky loans are not made), when insurers require that builders and owners mitigate natural disaster risks, and when the best new firms can get capital to expand. In the language of economics, this kind of expertise is socially valuable because it reduces the effects of asymmetric information and allows us to realize gains from trade that are a net benefit.  The principal investigator plans to develop a method for measuring how the social value of additional expertise compares to the private value.  The results could help us understand how financial markets contribute to US prosperity, and whether the US economy would be better off if more talented individuals went into medicine, technology, or research rather than into financial sector jobs.<br/><br/>The PI plans to derive an expression for the ratio of marginal social value to marginal private value of expertise. If firms are optimizing, the marginal private value is equal to the marginal cost of expertise, so it is possible to understand how social value compares to costs. By focusing on the ratio of marginal social value to marginal private value, he is able to avoid making any assumptions about the technology that leads to expertise acquisition.  He will use a sufficient statistic approach to measure the ratio, decomposing the ration into parts that correspond to measurable quantities for different branches of the financial sector. The results will provide empirical evidence on whether or not talent and effort that is now employed in the US financial sector might be more valuable in other pursuits."

During substorms, strong currents are diverted from large radial distances in the extended tail of the magnetosphere along magnetic field lines into and through the ionosphere on the nightside.  The ionospheric segment of the current is seen as a strong auroral electrojet (AEJ) at polar latitudes.  The equatorial electrojet (EEJ), on the other hand, is generated as a result of the interaction between neutral winds flowing away from a region of strong solar heating while dragging ions across magnetic field lines, and the unique geometry of strictly horizontal magnetic field lines at the dip equator.   The association between these electrojets implies that electric fields are penetrating from the polar region as far as the dip equator during substorms. Even though weak by the time they reach the equatorial region, their signatures can be observed in the modulation of the intense equatorial electrojet.  This is a proposal to investigate more completely the response of the equatorial electrojet to substorms and determine its global closure.  The penetration of the auroral electric field to low-latitudes, and the shielding that inhibits or prevents this penetration, are open and compelling questions for understanding and more accurately predicting space weather, which ultimately has benefits to society.  Significant broader impacts include the participation of high-school teachers and students during the summer in research associated with this project.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals of this project, the proposers will address two questions: (1) how does the auroral electrojet respond to substorms, and  (2) how is the substorm-related change of the dayside EEJ connected with the nightside AEJ.<br/>They will use data from a network of ground magnetometers, which includes 7 ground stations around the dip equator and a meridional chain of stations, along with auroral images from the Polar and IMAGE satellites. To answer question 1, they will use publicly-available lists of substorms, along with these observations, to determine statistically how often the EEJ responds to substorm onsets either by intensifying or weakening, the magnetic local time dependence of the response, and whether it is changed by the preceding level of geomagnetic activity.  To answer question 2, they will examine the magnetic deflection (a measure of electric current intensity) as a function of solar zenith angle and magnetic latitude to test the idea that the EEJ and AEJ are connected by meridional currents that flow around the terminator.  This is a new idea and a unique aspect of this proposal."

Unfortunately, the physics associated with ice sheet collapse is not fully understood, requiring a different approach to estimate future ice sheet response. This project seeks to quantify rates of sea-level change during a past warm period known as the last interglacial, ~125,000 years ago.  This information can then be used to constrain our projections of the rate of future sea-level rise.  In particular, the principal investigator will investigate the rate of sea-level changes during this past warm period associated with meter-scale sea-level oscillations.  The oscillations have been inferred from the features observed in sedimentary records from around the globe that suggest a dynamic instability in polar ice sheets during the warm period. The project includes student training and education (Ph.D. and masters students, and undergraduate students). A marine science class from the University of Florida will go to a sampling site in southern Florida to gain valuable field experience.  There is strong international collaboration between the principal investigator, U.S. students, and researchers from Mexico and Australia.

Rich in carbohydrates, and containing protein and vitamin C, the year-round availability of yams makes them preferable to seasonal crops. The importance of yams in West Africa is exemplified by their vital role in traditional culture, rituals and religion; yam production is declining, however, due to threats from pests and diseases. Thus, in the context of surging global population growth, improved yam breeding techniques are urgently needed. Water yam, also called greater yam (Dioscorea alata) is the most widely distributed cultivated yam species in the world, and its advantages include high nutritional content, long storability of tubers, and ability to yield in poor quality soil. This project will leverage cutting-edge DNA sequencing and computational analysis to provide a high quality water yam genome assembly and genetic map to the yam community, which will allow breeders to use modern genetic methods to breed the crop more efficiently. The project will also characterize the natural genetic variability present in global collections, yielding insight into how they may be used to improve the crop, and contributing to an understanding of the relationship between water yam DNA sequence and traits important to smallholder farmers. Bringing water yam into the modern genomics era will facilitate the accelerated release of improved varieties to the farmers that need them.<br/><br/>The water yam Dioscorea alata is superior to most cultivated yam species due to its potential to yield under low to average soil fertility, ease of propagation, early vigor for weed suppression, and low post-harvest losses. Threats, however, include anthracnose disease, which can cause losses of up to 90% of production, and breeding for desired traits in water yam is arduous due to its autopolyploid and heterozygous nature, long growth cycle, and erratic flowering. This project will accelerate the improvement of water yam by (1) constructing a high quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for D. alata, interpreted through annotation and comparative analysis, (2) producing a framework genetic map for D. alata via analysis of mapcrosses segregating for traits important for farmers, and (3) characterizing the global collection of D. alata cultivars. Advanced technologies such as PacBio de novo sequencing, whole-genome resequencing, genotyping-by-sequencing, flow cytometry for ploidy analysis, and publicly available and custom bioinformatics tools, will be leveraged. The chromosome-scale genome assembly and genetic map will lay the groundwork for more efficient breeding approaches such as genomic selection in water yam. Quantitative trait locus analysis of mapping populations segregating for anthracnose resistance and tuber quality is expected to yield specific sequence variants linked to, and thus mechanistic insight into, those traits. Study of water yam diversity across global collections will elucidate its breeding history, reveal bottlenecks, and suggest strategies for broadening the gene pool. All sequencing resources will be publicly available through the NCBI and the phytozome plant genomics resource."

For example, uncertainty in chemical models directly impacts the design of efficient combustion systems at the core of the U.S. energy and transportation infrastructure. The ability to incorporate uncertainty into computational models will directly advance understanding of how this uncertainty impacts subsequent model predictions and, therefore, our ability to make reliable decisions based on the predictions of these complex models. This work aims to provide such a computational infrastructure that can easily leverage the large scale computing resources deployed in the U.S. The framework developed in this work can enable improvements in the development of computational models by providing methodologies and tools for ascertaining the large sources of uncertainty. Additionally, the framework aims to enable better design of physical experiments by facilitating the identification of experimental scenarios that best inform the computational model. The cyberinfrastructure developed in this work is also aimed to provide the foundation for training the next generation of scientists and engineers to use contemporary computational and data-enabled science tools, theory, and practice. The project, thus is aligned to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The digital environment that this work aims to develop will support the Bayesian inference of unknown parameters in mathematical models based on partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, the computational environment will facilitate the creation, experimentation, and examination of all aspects of computational predictions with uncertainty: mathematical models, finite element formulations of PDEs, statistical surrogate models for complex systems, and algorithms for solving the statistical inverse problem. Significant progress in the state-of-the-art of both the solution of statistical inverse problems and the design of physical experiments will be made by easily enabling the presence and examination of uncertainty within complex simulation models. This platform will use modern high performance computing algorithms and be portable to extreme-scale computing infrastructure for the solution of those models. Finally, all elements will be deployed in portable, efficient, and easy-to-use software elements for use by the community at large."

As these applications demanded higher performance, the field of materials research has shifted its focus from using singular NMs (carbon only, metal only) to those comprised of several distinct types of NMs linked together, termed nanohybrids (NHs). Linking single NMs in this capacity is likely to create new properties and behavior in environmental and biological settings that have not yet been predicted or studied. As the scale of NH use rapidly increases there is likely to be significant opportunity for their presence in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the goal of this proposed work is to proactively identify novel and unanticipated properties and associated behavior of carbon-metal NHs that have current relevance to the fuel cell industry. These studies would be the first to investigate whether combining singular NMs to form NHs alters the way they behave in the environment and interact with aquatic organisms. <br/><br/>Extracting novel properties by developing ensembles of two or more nano-scale materials is an emerging trend in several industries. However, most of our knowledge regarding nano-environmental behavior is limited to passive nanostructures with singular composition (e.g. carbon, metal). We hypothesize that NHs will display novel unforeseen properties that are highly important in driving their behavior in environmental matrices and organisms. To address this notion we propose to carry out the following aims: (1) synthesize a set of metal-carbon nanotube NHs with high degree of control with the objective of tuning band architecture and material stiffness; (2) characterize physical morphology, mechanical stiffness, band gap, distribution of metal/metal oxides on nanotubes; (3) examine NH interaction with the environmental interfaces by studying particle-particle and particle-collector interaction as well as determining particle dissolution in a wide range of environmental conditions; (4) assess behavior and interaction of NHs at biological interfaces using a well-established aquatic model coupled with high-throughput contemporary measurements of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This work is innovative in that it is the first to execute controlled synthesis and characterization of a suite of NHs and component materials that will be investigated in aquatic environments and model organisms (fish). This work is timely in that it will lay the foundation for further research in understanding NHs in complex but relevant environments and reveal novel properties and mechanisms of action in biological systems that have not been studied. <br/><br/>The proposed work will generate critical and fundamental knowledge to better understand the environmental interaction of a set of complex hierarchical nanomaterials, metal-carbonaceous NHs.  These NHs are highly relevant to the expanding fuel cell industry; therefore, results of this work would directly influence materials science and nano communities and help inform the general public about nano-environmental research.

The theory of GR has helped us to make many tremendous progresses in understanding the fundamental aspect of space and time. The theory has been successful in describing the physics of universe, as well as making predictions for various astrophysical phenomena. However it is also well-known that the theory of GR is incomplete. It loses its capability of making predictions in the extremely strong gravitational field, e.g. inside a black hole, or at the very early stage of universe near the big bang. One of the most fundamental open questions in physics is how to complete GR in order to predict physics in an extremely strong gravitational field. The complete theory of gravity that we are searching for is called ""Quantum Gravity"". The theory of Quantum Gravity should play a crucial role in describing the physics inside black hole, and helping us to understand the early universe near the big bang. Eventually Quantum Gravity will lead us to a revolutionary understanding of space and time. The PI's group will also train students in STEM areas of research.<br/><br/>This award support the development of a the theory of known as ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" (LQG). LQG is an approach toward Quantum Gravity featured with the background independence and non-perturbative quantization of spacetime structure. In developing the theory of LQG, the PI presented a promising new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant. The new formulation defines finite spinfoam amplitudes of LQG. It also relates LQG to many other branches of physics and mathematics, in particular, it points out a concrete relation between LQG and String/M-Theory. The new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant is going to be fully explored in this project, hopefully making progress towards some open issues in cosmology. The proposed work aims at (1) completing both the non-perturbative and perturbative formulation of the new model; (2) obtaining new insights and tools for LQG by exploring the relation to String/M-Theory and AdS/CFT; (3) extracting phenomenological predictions on the physics of cosmological constant.

It was immediately clear that these are fascinating novel materials.  They have led to new insights into the reasons for glass formation and the processes by which a liquid turns into a glass upon cooling.  Additionally, sustained research has shown that they have superior properties that make them of potential technological interest.   These include strengths greater than those of steels, high hardness and good corrosion resistance.  However, the first glasses required that the liquid be cooled at rates approaching one million degrees per second, limiting their practical applications.   About 20 years ago new families of metallic glasses (?Bulk Metallic Glasses,? or BMGs) were discovered, which could be formed and processed in ways similar to those used for more common glasses. This caused an intense resurgence of research that now appears to be moving metallic glasses from the laboratory into the market place.   To sustain this fast paced fundamental and technological research, frequent conferences and workshops are needed for scientists and engineers to present new results and exchange ideas.   Because of the intense activity of this field in Asia, almost all of the meetings of the BMG conference series, the central conference for bulk metallic glasses, have taken place there.    The only one held outside of Asia was BMG IV, held in 2005 in the United States.   Travel expenses and limited research funds has limited the participation of US scientists, post-docs and students in these conferences.   The support provided for BMG XI, which is to be held from June 5 ? 9, 2016 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, will enable broader participation of US students and young researchers.   <br/><br/><br/>&#8195;<br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Metallic glasses, first discovered in 1960, remained primarily a laboratory curiosity for most of the time between 1960 and 1990.

Their combination of high electrical resistivity, low susceptibility and low magnetic coercivity, for example, led to their use as core materials for high-quality electrical transformers.  In the 1990s, new families of metallic glasses (?Bulk Metallic Glasses,? or BMGs) were discovered that formed at much lower cooling rates and could be processed under conditions similar to those used for silicate glasses.  This led to an intense research activity, now resulting in the emergence of metallic glasses as potentially very important new technological materials.   Because the research activity is particularly intense in Asia, almost all of the meetings in the BMG conference series (the central conference for bulk metallic glasses) have taken place there.   The last BMG meeting outside of Asia was held in the US in 2005 (BMG IV).   The increasingly limited research funding and significant travel expenses have resulted in small US participation in these conferences, particularly among young US researchers and students.  To maintain a vibrant research activity, it is critical that researchers meet frequently to exchange ideas and present new results.   The lack of significant US participation in this series, particularly among our future scientific leadership, hampers US advancements in this important field.  To address this, BMG XI will be held from June 5 ? 9, 2016 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.   Many outstanding issues of basic and practical importance will be discussed, including glass design, stability and relaxation, structure, dynamics, properties, and applications.  For the first time, panels will discuss establishing testing standards and explore new manufacturing possibilities that take full advantage of the unique properties of metallic glasses.  Two keynote, 10 plenary, 22 invited and 58 contributed oral presentations are scheduled, along with 28 poster presentations.   To encourage greater participation among US graduate student and young faculty, funds will be used to provide travel and/or registration assistance.   By hosting BMG XI in the US, we are increasing the US participation, which will allow US researchers to be exposed to cutting edge ideas and results, and provide new opportunities for interaction and collaborations."

These rock walls then become unstable and can collapse in catastrophic landslides. In Alaska, where this phenomenon is increasingly common, landslides sometimes fall directly into the ocean and trigger a tsunami. This is what happened in October 2015 in the Taan Fiord: the largest rock avalanche in America in decades plunged 150 million tons of debris into the head of the fiord, producing a wave of water that ran 150m up the opposite bank and scoured the forested flanks of the fiord for at least 12km. The goal of the project is to collect observations of this Taan landslide and tsunami, and to deliver a benchmark dataset to the science and engineering communities so that they can better prepare for future disasters.<br/><br/>The project will combine satellite images, field observations and ship-based mapping to constrain the dynamics of the landslide and tsunami, including the mass and velocity of debris when it struck the water, the magnitude of tsunami wave generation and its pattern of motion, and the submarine flow of debris and its deposition.

There is thus an urgent need for the development of methodologies that formalize analysis of complex data.

In the last 15 years, dense Global Positioning System (GPS) and earthquake observations made at subduction zones have revealed a new style of fault slip.  In addition to continuous slip and sudden earthquake motion, many faults experience slow slip. In some instances, a relationship between slow slip and damaging large earthquakes has been observed. Most observations of slow slip occur at 20-40 km depth below the seafloor.  At the Hikurangi margin offshore of New Zealand, slow slip also occurs at shallow depths, but detailed investigation of shallow slow slip has been hampered by the lack of suitable seafloor observations. Understanding the extent, distribution, and range of physical conditions for shallow slow slip events is important, especially since the shallow fault interface is where tsunamis are generated by earthquakes. This project uses recently collected ocean bottom seismic and absolute pressure gauge data from the Hikurangi margin to investigate the relationship between earthquake and slow slip and the physical conditions that favor them. Results of this research will be incorporated into an earthquake science course for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science program for high school students at the University of California-Santa Cruz.  This project involves the mentoring and training of three graduate students and two to four undergraduate interns, including at least one from an underrepresented group in the Earth Sciences. All students will benefit by receiving training from researchers at different institutions.<br/><br/>A large shallow slow slip event occurred in October 2014, directly beneath the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip instrument array, a major U.S. led international experiment with Japanese and New Zealand researchers.  The experiment was designed to investigate the physical environment that hosts shallow slow slip and its relationship to destructive, seismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction thrust.  This project will build on the initial data analysis from this experiment to tackle four main objectives: 1) to improve initial tremor and earthquake detection and location using the PageRank technique and matched filtering cross correlation, 2) to investigate changes in coulomb failure stress imparted on the megathrust from the 2014 slow slip event and compare it to earthquake and tremor locations to test whether static stress changes can explain their location, 3) to determine earthquake source parameters and explore their spatial and temporal relationships with slow slip, geodetic coupling and physical properties of the plate interface and 4) to improve images of seismic velocity and attenuation structure using body wave velocity and attenuation tomography and ambient noise surface wave tomography.  This project will complement similar efforts in Cascadia and Japan, allowing comparison of the properties and environment of shallow and deep slow slip and build a detailed picture of the relationship between seismic and aseismic slip and its dependence on the velocity and attenuation structure."

Current interface modalities such as video, keyboard, tactile, audio, and speech can all contribute to an HRI interface. However, an emerging area is the use of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for communication and information exchange between humans and robots. BCIs can provide another channel of communication with more direct access to physiological changes in the brain. BCIs vary widely in their capabilities, particularly with respect to spatial resolution, temporal resolution and noise. This project is aimed at exploring the use of multimodal BCIs for HRI. Multimodal BCIs, also referred to as hybrid BCIs (hBCI), have been shown to improve performance over single modality interfaces. This project is focused on using a novel suite of sensors (Electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, pupillary size, computer vision, and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)) to improve current HRI systems. Each of these sensing modalities can reinforce and complement each other, and when used together, can address a major shortcoming of current BCIs which is the determination of the user state or situational awareness (SA). SA is a necessary component of any complex interaction between agents, as each agent has its own expectations and assumptions about the environment. Traditional BCI systems have difficulty recognizing state and context, and accordingly can become confusing and unreliable. This project will develop techniques to recognize state from multiple modalities, and will also allow the robot and human to learn about each other's state and expectations using the hBCI we are developing. The goal is to build a usable hBCI for real physical robot environments, with noise, real-time constraints, and added complexity.<br/><br/>The technical contributions of this project include:<br/>1. Characterization of a novel hBCI interface for visual recognition and labeling tasks with real physical data and environments.<br/>2. Integration of fNIRS sensing with EEG and other modalities in human robot interaction tasks. We will test our ability in the temporal domain to determine at what timescale we can correctly classify movement components that would predict a correct (rewarding) trial or non-rewarding/incorrect movement.<br/>3. Analysis and validation of the hBCI in complex robotic tele-operation tasks with human subject operators such as open door, grasp object on table, pick up item off floor etc.<br/>4. Use of hBCI to characterize human/robot state and create a learning method to recognize state over time.<br/>5. Use of augmented reality for HRI decision making.<br/>6. Further develop hBCI for tracking cognitive states related to reward, motivation, attention and value.<br/>A new class of HRI interfaces will be developed that can expand the ability of humans to work with robots; promote the use and acceptance of robot agent systems in everyday life; expand the use of hBCIs in areas other than robotics for human-machine interaction; further the development of hBCIs as our system will be tapping into reward modulated activity that will be used via reinforcement learning to autonomously update the learning machinery; and bridge the educational divide between Engineering and Neuroscience."

An overarching goal of this project is to determine whether observed changes in key climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity are a result of human activities, related to naturally occurring climate variability, or a combination of both. Given its influential agricultural sector, climate variability and change in South America can have global ramifications. <br/><br/>This goal will be accomplished through two tasks. The first task is to assess whether the changes in these key climate variables differ significantly from trends that could arise as a result of naturally occurring climate variability. The extent to which humans have influenced climate over the continent to date will also be quantified. The second task will be to systematically examine mechanisms leading to natural climate variability over South America, including patterns of variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Using this comprehensive understanding of the natural and anthropogenic influences on observed changes in climate, the ability of current state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce these features in simulations of the past will be evaluated.  In the case that a given climate model can simulate observed trends in climate and features of natural climate variability with reasonable skill, confidence in future projections of climate can be boosted. A major goal of this project to develop methods of conveying the multi-dimensional nature of the investigation results in a concise and easily interpretable way to better inform those communities interested in climate information for South America.  Furthermore, the approaches and methods used here will be extensible to other regions of the world.    <br/><br/>Key results of the project will be presented, interpreted, and made publicly available via a user-friendly website to serve both scientific and non-scientific audiences. These results will be communicated throughout the South American climate science and information communities via an email list associated with the World Climate Research Programme's Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).  Additionally, the project will support the professional development of a postdoctoral scientist and a graduate student.  All team members will participate in publishing results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in reporting results at relevant professional conferences and meetings. In all cases, the presentation style will aim to the broad community interested in South American climate science and information."

Billions of dollars have been invested each year to generate such data. However, the pace at which data is being generated far outstrips the scientific community's ability to locate the best data for a given project.  The traditional method of waiting for peer-reviewed publications to be text-mined so a researcher can then search via PubMed to locate interesting conclusions is too slow. Thus, a new approach is needed to accelerate the search, find, and analysis process that is at heart of scientific inquiry. The proposed technology, OmicSeq, addresses this by extracting signal directly from raw data thus avoiding the publication cycle, which itself can be biased and typically reflects only a fraction of the value of the data. Moreover, researchers seeking quality data can exploit the search portal offered by OmicSeq to rapidly identify publicly available (or privately generated) data sets known to be correlated to a give gene or pathway query. In effect OmicSeq does for biological data what Google has done for web pages-find the data that is most closely related to genomic query. This accelerates the research cycle and allows investigators to reuse and re-examine repository data that would otherwise go unused. OmicSeq saves the researcher time (therefore money), and helps to make more use out of the data that has been generated.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team plans to market the OmicSeq system using the software-as-a service (SaaS) business model. While a basic version of OmicSeq will be provided free online, the team will make majority of the database and data mining tools available only to customers who pay an annual licensing fee. A similar model has been adopted by numerous bioinformatics service providers. This team expects to attract customers in academic, industry as well as research institutes and government agencies. In surveying university research institutions, this team has determined that annual site licenses run in the range from $20,000 to $50,000 depending upon the degree of access offered. However, the team is actively conducting research to determine what the appropriate licensing costs would be to pharmaceutical companies since they typically pay a much higher license fee for at least two reasons: 1) pharmaceutical companies have private data;  thus security is of utmost importance. 2) the magnitude of data can be much larger than the publicly processed data sources that comprise the base offering of OmicSeq. Most of the proposed work at this point relates to accurately assessing the pharmaceutical market."

On land, networks of instruments are available to measure the build-up of strain across the Cascadia subduction zone fault. Similar observations are required offshore to understand the dynamics of the subduction zone better, and to place stronger constraints on the earthquakes and tsunamis the fault produces every few hundred years.  This project uses calibrated seafloor pressure sensors to make accurate measurements of the elevation of the seafloor at six sites off the coast of central Oregon.  The project will initiate a decadal study that will measure changes in seafloor elevation that result from the build-up, and potentially the release, of strain across the subduction zone fault.  The study will constrain the width of the locked portion of the fault that will break in the next large subduction zone earthquake. The project will involve two graduate students, and include at least four undergraduates on each research expedition.<br/><br/>High-quality offshore vertical geodetic measurements will be used to provide a baseline suitable for resolving secular strain caused by locking across the Cascadia subduction zone, and for detecting slow slip events. Several previous studies have shown that seafloor pressure measurements can detect slow-slip events, but the drift of seafloor pressure sensors has limited their application to measuring secular strain. The University of Washington (UW) and Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) have collaborated to build and successfully test a campaign version of the SIO seafloor calibrated pressure recorder, the Absolute Seafloor Calibrated Pressure Recorder (ASCPR).  This instrument measures absolute pressures to an accuracy equivalent to ~1 cm of water depth.  Repeat measurements with the ASCPR on stable seafloor benchmarks equipped with a continuously recording bottom pressure gauge will be used to remove the drift from pressure time series and enable measurements of secular strain. The UW and SIO have deployed a trench-perpendicular profile of 6 benchmarks and bottom pressure recorders off central Oregon. This project supports repeat campaign-style absolute pressure measurements over two years on each benchmark to fully characterize the repeatability of ASCPR measurements and initiate a decadal study required to measure secular strain. By utilizing stable, undisturbed benchmarks to make accurate absolute pressure measurements, this effort could transform our capabilities for making long-term geodetic observations offshore. Complementary geodetic and physical oceanographic modeling studies are being used to further understand the expected geodetic signals and develop improved methods to separate geodetic and oceanographic components of pressure."

Another contemporary example comes from the widely used rating and recommendation systems, where a rating depends on the user, user demographic, product being rated and time. In fact, this is the case for numerous other applications such as cellular network performance statistics, geophysical systems for earth sciences, and education statistics in interactive learning and collaboration environments.

The research also addresses the challenges, which arise in deploying the framework for large-scale applications and investigates numerical and memory efficient algorithms. Integration of research and education is enabled through new cross-cutting curriculum development, continued undergraduate mentoring, and through integration of the research outcomes with existing undergraduate curriculum.

The H and O atom concentrations are measured with a femtosecond (fs) laser to avoid interference from laser photolysis that plagued earlier efforts. With the validated computationally efficient 2D tubular flame models, simplified models of molecular transport (e.g., mixture-averaged transport and approximate Soret effect models) and reduced species chemical kinetic mechanisms can be developed for more accurate turbulent combustion models burning hydrogen, methane and propane. Once the detailed 2D model is validated, simplified transport and chemical kinetic mechanisms will be developed and/or evaluated for use in turbulent combustion modeling. Quantitative 2D models verified by multi-scalar measurements of cellular structures will provide data for development of simplified models of hydrogen and hydrocarbon flames used for practical combustors in heating, energy production and propulsion. Development of H and O atom quantitative measurements with femtosecond lasers will lead to adoption of the fs-LIF method by other research groups in the world. Graduate students and undergraduate students will be involved in research with an emphasis in recruiting underrepresented minorities. Students will present their results at research conferences. Students will collaborate with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Spectral Energies in Dayton, Ohio on femto-second laser measurement giving them a broad exposure to the latest computer simulation and laser diagnostic facilities."

There is a big chasm between the languages that programmers use to describe problems and the encodings that are suitable for solvers to conduct search. This research aims to narrow the gap by designing and implementing algorithms for translating declarative specifications of combinatorial problems into efficient encodings. The intellectual merits are novel frameworks and algorithms for translating planning specifications into sophisticated and efficient tabled logic programs, and cutting-edge algorithms for compiling high-level constraints into SAT (satisfiability) encodings. The project's broader significance and importance are its potential to produce long-lasting, significant economic, educational, and social impact because of the ubiquity of combinatorial problems, and the resulting theory and prototypes that will form the technology which enables future systems to obtain high-quality solutions to a variety of combinatorial problems. <br/><br/>This research will focus on two types of combinatorial problems: AI planning and constraint satisfaction problems solved using SAT. Tabled logic programming has been shown to be a powerful and flexible modeling and solving language for planning problems. Nevertheless, it is an art, not a science, to develop efficient planning models in tabled logic programming. The algorithms designed by this research for translating planning specifications into efficient tabled logic programs will have the following capabilities: (1) convert factored representations of states into structural representations that exploit symmetries; (2) extract domain-dependent control knowledge, such as deterministic actions and partial orders; and (3) learn representation-specific heuristics. Global constraints are an important part of constraint programming. They not only allow easy modeling of many problems, but also enable use of powerful propagation algorithms. SAT encoding algorithms have been proposed for some of the global constraints. Nevertheless, there are no well-established algorithms for encoding global constraints into SAT; many other global constraints, such as graph constraints, have not received much attention despite their usefulness in practical applications. This research will produce algorithms for a comprehensive set of global constraints, and will develop a cutting-edge constraint-solving system based on these algorithms."

Although rooted in particular social and economic orders,  social inequality also manifests in individual biology and psychology. However, the complex and interacting connections involved are not well understood; physical and mental health disparities can be both the cause and the effect of social inequality. Understanding how these disparities interact is important because they can be mutually-reinforcing and thus difficult to escape once the cycle has begun. The research supported by this award will investigate these linkages through the lens of food insecurity and the pathways that connect it to mental ill health, as mediated by cultural and social differences. Although the research will be conducted outside of the United States to take advantage of analytically useful comparisons, its findings will be universally applicable.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken by anthropologists Dr. Lesley J. Weaver (University of Alabama) and Dr. Craig A. Hadley (Emory University) in three rapidly developing communities in Brazil, Ethiopia, and Haiti.  These research sites were chosen because all three have experienced food shortages in recent memory and in each setting, social inequality is creating noticeable disparities in life chances.  At the same time, the three research sites also differ in scientifically useful ways: they have culturally distinct food cultures and each has a different degree of integration with the global economy. In each site, the researchers will collect information on social and cultural meanings associated with the acquisition, preparation, and consumption of foods; they will do mental and physical health assessments; and they will look at the relationships between these data to weigh the importance of biological (especially nutritional) and cultural factors as pathways that connect food insecurity to mental ill health. Data will be gathered through interviews about health and well-being; participant observation; the collection of basic health biometrics; and the administration of culturally adapted mental health scales. Cross-site comparisons will allow the researchers to assess whether or not there is a shared experience of food insecurity and mental health problems that we are likely to see in other global locations, including the United States. Findings from this research will help to better understand the connection between human society, culture, biology, and psychology. Results also will help to improve the effectiveness of development and aid programs designed to alleviate mental health problems and food insecurity and alleviate some of the harmful effects of social inequality."

This study will examine a past major extinction of megafauna in order to understand the cascading effects on ecosystems. About 13,000 years ago many species of large mammals in the Americas became extinct. This research will examine the consequences of the loss of these large carnivores and herbivores from the food web to the remaining plant and animal communities. The responses seen at this long-ago event will be used to develop general concepts relevant to modern-day changes in plant and animal communities. This project will also make fossil data more easily accessible and interpretable, will improve museum collections, and will inform the public through outreach activities conducted by the Smithsonian Institution. This work will also provide graduate and undergraduate students with research experience that will strengthen the scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The consequences of the loss of tens of millions of large-bodied mammals about 13,000 years ago on the structure and functioning of ecosystems in the Americas will be examined in order to address four questions: How did the extinction of large-bodied mammals influence overall community structure and species interactions at the terminal Pleistocene; Did surviving species become more abundant or change their geographic distribution; What changes in morphology, if any, occurred in species that survived the extinction; Did surviving species alter their dietary niche in response to the extinction of megafauna? Patterns of abundance, distribution, diet and morphology in the surviving mammals both before and after the extinction event will be characterized. Using occurrence information from fossil database compilations, morphology and size will be determined by measuring fossil limbs and molars, and diet by using stable isotope analysis. These data will be integrated with reconstructions of vegetative communities using pollen databases and regional and global temperature records. An important ecological baseline for the understanding of contemporary trophic downgrading will be established by characterizing how terrestrial ecosystems were influenced by humans at an important point in human history."

Given the data volumes, it can be difficult to harness the data to understand phenomena and/or to make forecasts. Fitting models to the observational data is one way to accomplish this. A precursor to building such models is extracting features from the data. Models constructed using such features can then be used to predict what the outcome will be and when it is likely to happen.  This research will provide scientists and researchers the tools needed to make sense of data streams generated in streaming environments. Domains where this research is broadly applicable include smart cities, traffic planning, homeland security, and ecological monitoring. The project includes an educational component focused on increasing female student participation in college STEM majors. Therefore, this project aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science, to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare, and to secure the national defense.<br/><br/>The project aims to carry out research to create an enabling infrastructure to support the generation, assessment, and refinement of ad hoc models from voluminous, multidimensional, time-series observational data at scale. Challenges in ad hoc model creation stem from the combinatorially explosive number of ways in which models can be realized. The framework, Synapse, aims to support and simplify the naturally iterative and interactive model building process over voluminous streaming data. Modelers will only need to specify a basic set of bootstrap parameters; the framework will manage complexities relating to: (1) how streams are dispersed, (2) how data accesses are managed, (3) coping with I/O and memory contentions, and (4) dispersion of model generation workloads. The research involves scalable techniques for data dispersion employing distributed hash table data structures, map-reduce-based workflows and orchestration of model creation workloads, training data management, and interactive visual assessment of model performance. A visualization component will allow modelers to quickly and effectively assess the quality of a multiplicity of models each possibly covering a different portion of the input feature space and to use these assessments to guide decisions about selection, updates or replacements of models. If successful, the framework will scale with increases in data volumes, the number of available data streams, model generation workloads, and live model evaluations."

The result is a novel advanced privacy tool needed in countries that prohibit the use of encryption or in a hostile environment when there is need to communicate without attracting attention via channels in control of an adversary or via public, insecure channels. On the other hand, a deeper understanding of the limits of covert communication will facilitate better defense against such methods of deception, an effort recognized as steganalysis.

The proposed device can remove heavy metals, such as lead, copper, arsenic, and other elements from tap water that can cause serious health issues. Lead containing pipes in old water distribution systems and old buildings can introduce lead to the tap water as seen in the ongoing water crisis case in Flint, MI. The lead poisoning is uncompromised and it may have lifelong consequences on Flint children. Lead may cause severe consequences, such as dropping the IQ and behavioral abnormalities with multi-generational impacts. In such cases in urban areas, the drinking water needs to be treated in household levels since it may take a long time to have the problem fixed by the administrative organizations and regulators. The proposed device can be utilized in these conditions to purify the drinking water and eliminate the undesired elements from water. The device can also be distributed in cities where residents prefer to purchase bottled water or use household water treatment systems to ensure that there will not be any long-term effects of undesired elements in water. Additionally, the device can be used for drinking water purification in rural areas where residents often suffer from unavailability of safe drinkable water. Through the NSF I-Corps program, the team intends to prove the value proposition of the technology and evaluate prospective clients.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is building a new portable efficient drinking water purification device for removal of heavy metals and other ions from water. The proposed device, utilizes not only physical adsorption approach, which is the main heavy metal removal method in common heavy metal removal filters, but also the electrical force to enhance the ion removal process. In this device, the applied electrical field triggers the electro-migration of the ions toward electrodes and then the ions are physically adsorbed on the adsorbent surface. Additionally, the mixing feature of the device enhances the overall mass transfer rate in the process. The adsorbent can be regenerated effectively or replaced after a period of functioning. Therefore, the operating cost of this new device will be much lower than common membrane-based technologies and its efficiency is higher than the adsorption-based water treatment filters. The device will be made in two models, one for urban areas, which can utilize AC electricity and has mixing capability with higher efficiency, and the other for use in off-grid and rural areas, which is simpler and can be energized using batteries. Therefore, the scope of the potential customers will be wider and the device's application will not be limited to a specific condition due to its effective and quick removal of heavy metals and other common ionic pollutants in water. The experience during the I-Corps program will help the team develop a business and commercialize a needed product."

Highly skilled instructors provide an intense immersion in statistical methods.  The courses are oriented towards graduate students and young researchers.  The curriculum covers the underlying principles of modern statistics.  It covers advanced methods useful in astronomy, and hands-on training in statistical software.  Attendees gain much better expertise in statistics and its application to their science.  They have a better understanding of how to teach this material to others.  The value and meaning of statistics in science become clear.  The instructors devote considerable effort to adapting the course material to their audience.  In 2012, the course leaders published a formal textbook based on this curriculum, which continues to evolve.<br/><br/>A vast range of statistical problems arises in modern astronomical and space sciences research, particularly due to the flood of data produced by ground-based and space-based surveys at many wavelengths.  There has been a resurgence of interest in statistical and computational methods as researchers seek insight into the physical phenomena underlying such complex data.  Common approaches either inadequately utilize known methods or require the invention of new methods.  Regrettably, the statistical needs of physical scientists have been neglected in recent decades, even while modern statistical procedures implemented with computationally efficient algorithms became increasingly essential.

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles, approximately equal numbers of ions and electrons, and magnetic fields blowing outward from the Sun, which varies in intensity with solar activity.  The solar wind moves so fast that when it encounters the magnetosphere a shock forms upstream from it.  As solar wind plasma passes through the shock it is slowed down and then flows around the magnetosphere in a sheath region, called the magnetosheath.   In this region the magnetic field is erratic or turbulent and evidence suggests that magnetosheath ions are heated as this turbulence is dissipated.  The topic is compelling because the potential importance of turbulence and associated ion heating has only recently been recognized. Ions in the magnetosheath eventually cross the magnetopause to provide the dominant source of magnetospheric plasmas, thus changes in their temperature and other properties can have a profound effect on the stability of the magnetosphere itself, which can lead to explosive releases of energy during geomagnetic storms and substorms.  The methodology for this study is creative and an important advance over previous studies because it is the first self-consistent comprehensive treatment of this turbulence and its dissipation. As such, the potential for new discoveries is high. Advances in understanding will have benefit to society because, in the longer term, they will contribute to the development of an improved predictive capability that can be used to minimize the impacts of such events.  This research contributes to the development of a scientific workforce by training a postdoctoral student and a graduate student.  Research results will be disseminated through publications, conferences, and community outreach.<br/><br/>In order to fulfill its objectives, this study investigate how Alfvenic turbulence heats magnetosheath ions, how the heating process saturates, the rate at which energy is transferred to the ions, how electromagnetic energy is transported to support the heating process, how secondary wave emissions develop during the heating, and how the heating process influences the bulk characteristics of the magnetosheath plasma.  The primary tool is a 3D hybrid particle in cell model.  The proposal uses wave/ion heating events observed by the THEMIS satellites to both specify initial conditions and to validate simulation results.  An innovative aspect is the coupled treatment of both the cascade processes associated with plasma turbulence and the additional instabilities that arise from the anisotropies that develop in the ion distributions."

The gas leak was the largest such event in US history.  Methane is flammable gas.  Increasing concentrations of methane in the atmosphere can have a potent ""greenhouse"" effect.  This NSF RAPID award will support the characterization, identity and activity of methane-consuming microorganisms in the soil in response to the gas leak, to better understand ecosystem-level impacts of the disaster. Atmospheric measurements of leaking methane will be compared to measurements of soil microorganisms near the site of the gas leak, as well as tracing the flow of methane-derived carbon through the soil ecosystem over time.  The data collected in this time course study will assist with future modeling of the contribution of soil-associated microorganisms to global methane cycling. Understanding the fate of methane released from this extreme event has benefits to both the scientific research community and to public safety.<br/><br/>Soil carbon derived from methane is hypothesized to measurably increase as a result of the gas leak. The known microorganisms that consume methane for energy and carbon occur within distinct phylogenetic lineages, and the soil microbial community (as well as overall carbon flow) is expected to measurably shift as a result of this leak.  Specific components of the research to measure such changes include: (1) Detailed monitoring of methane and ethane emissions including air and soil concentrations, during and following the leak. Methods employed to monitor methane levels will include surface instrumentation, spectrometry measurements from air in collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology faculty, satellite observations, and field measurements. (2) Regular and frequent targeted sampling of soils during and following the period of active natural gas emission. (3) Identification and characterization of the soil microbial response to methane enrichment. (4) Assessment of changes in the soil microbial community and microeukaryotes associated with input of methane-derived carbon. Laboratory methods for these latter components include microbial community profiling with high throughput sequencing, RNA-based activity assays; DNA-based stable isotope probing with 13CH4 to trace methane derived carbon into the local microbial community, and rate measurements of methane metabolism in laboratory-based chamber incubations of collected soils. Sites surrounding the leak event and background areas will be sampled over a regular time course to track population dynamics during and following the gas leak.

This I-Corps team proposes to develop a technology that provides men a new way to assess their sperm quality and fertility. Ultimately, it helps the infertile couples that are seeking treatment options. Furthermore, assessing sperm quality is also important to sperm banks, fertility clinics, and farmers that produce livestock because the ability to select the best quality sperm leads to an increase in productivity and profit. Currently, only some aspects of sperm quality can be determined, and the proposed project expands the parameters of sperm analysis, leading to better sperm evaluation and identification of unrecognized infertility. Since the technology identifies a new type of infertility, it has the potential to be a disruptive innovation in the reproductive medicine market.<br/><br/>One out of eight couples is infertile, affecting millions of people in the USA alone. With current technology, approximately 20% of these couples do not know the basis of their infertility and cannot attribute it to either the man or the woman. This rate of infertility describes a very broad and compelling market need. The technology provides physicians in fertility clinics the ability to identify whether male patients are infertile and predict the success of in vitro fertilization. Since treatments are usually not covered by insurance and have only a 25% chance of success, anything that can increase the predictability of success would be an important way to maintain physicians' reputations and success ratios. Other potential market areas might be agricultural; farms that breed livestock such as turkey, dairy cattle, and pigs, by using artificial insemination. This technology would provide the farmer a diagnostic tool to assess semen quality to increase agricultural productivity. Furthermore, sperm banks could use our technology to predict the quality of the sperm they sell. Overall the technology would significantly enhance the assessment of sperm quality and capability to produce a healthy baby or offspring. Using I-Corps funding this team will determine specific areas where the proposed technology can be utilized.  In order to investigate the customers' needs, such as accuracy level, price, and ease of use, this team will look for potential customers who have experienced the current technology and customers who are not satisfied with the current technology."

Enrollments in statistics courses as well as statistics degrees awarded are surging across U.S. universities. The numbers of universities granting both graduate and undergraduate degrees in statistics and biostatistics are at all-time highs. At the same time, data science is emerging as an important research program and the demand for data science skills is rapidly increasing in the public and private sectors. Since statistics represents a foundational discipline in data science, statistics and biostatistics department chairs need to ensure statisticians are effective partners in intramural and extramural university data science programs.  This workshop brings together statistics and biostatistics department chairs to address current challenges and learn directly from funding agency and private sector representatives about data science and research funding trends, in order to help statistics and biostatistics departments ensure a comprehensive approach both to data science research and to training graduates with skills that meet workforce demands. <br/><br/>Statisticians and statistics play a very important role in advancing science. This workshop provides an opportunity for statistics, biostatistics, and related department chairs to discuss current trends, challenges, and opportunities relating to surging enrollments, workforce needs, research trends, data science, and other issues. To inform discussions, participants will hear from private sector representatives concerning workforce needs, funding agency representatives on funding programs and trends, academic leaders on statistics and data science education, and university administrators on cross-campus research and educational efforts. Because a goal of this workshop is to equip department chairs to further engage their faculty in cross-campus interdisciplinary research and data science efforts, the workshop has strong potential to improve scientific research. Proceedings of the workshop will be recorded, summarized, and disseminated in a format constructive to the participants and the broader community.

This research effort concentrates on approaches for identifying and labeling representations within the captured data that integrate a priori structural and spatial configuration knowledge.  The automatic identification and labeling of volumetric pixels (voxels) produced by volumetric scanners presents challenging ill-posed problems that presently remain unsolved.  Even for well trained clinicians, determining organ boundaries when applying anatomical labels to low contrast medical images can be highly subjective, despite possessing strong prior anatomical knowledge of structure and shape.  Consequently, an anatomical delineation performed by different clinicians, even for the same patient image, fails to provide consistency.  More difficult ill-posed problems, such as matching corresponding voxels between images of a patient taken at different times---or, more difficult yet, between two entirely different patients---are so subjective that humans rarely provide consistent answers.  This research effort aims to develop algorithmic solutions to these problems in order to provide consistent quantitative analysis across volumes; thereby removing subjectivity attributable to inattentional blindness or unintentional bias.  With further advancement, such algorithms will be adequately fast and robust to extract anatomic structural information and perform patient correspondence autonomously at massive scales; thereby enabling powerful data analytics paving the way for the future of data driven medicine.  Through classroom integration and curriculum development, the PI will train science and engineering students to work with this next generation of image processing algorithms.  The PI will recruit and mentor researchers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels with emphasis on the recruitment of underrepresented groups within STEM related fields.  Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>This research project consists of three primary efforts: first, the simultaneous segmentation of multiple structures using spatial relationship priors (i.e. situationally aware segmentation); second, the development of structurally aware registration algorithms (leveraging segmentation results); and third, the development of these algorithms specifically targeted to data parallel computer architectures.  Situationally aware algorithms developed by the PI will aim to perform simultaneous multi-target segmentations as well as anatomically specialized inference of organ deformation and motion that are robust to imaging inconsistencies, setup variations, and low-dose imaging.  The PI will investigate algorithmic methods possessing robustness to noisy, incomplete, or otherwise challenging image acquisitions by solving multiple inverse problems simultaneously and achieving higher accuracy through the coupling of solutions and exploitation of signal sparsity under certain basises.  The algorithms produced by this research will have broad societal impacts on fields employing computed tomography including archeology, soil sciences, the timber industry, biological sciences, industrial X-ray based inspection, and the aviation security industry.  In addition to the dissemination of the novel algorithms, the PI will develop high-performance parallel implementations as a library released under a permissive open-source license.  Development will occur in the open using Git; thereby enabling agile decentralized development that encourages increased utilization by and contributions from scientists and developers extramural to the project.  Algorithmic facilities initially selected for inclusion are areas of principal investigator's expertise and cover a wide spectrum of applications including motion estimation, image stitching, segmentation, 3D volume reconstruction (computed tomography), and registration/image fusion.  Through consortia and workshops, domain experts will be encouraged to contribute their expertise in established and emerging fields (e.g.  digital image forensics); enabling scientific cross-fertilization and collaboration across domain specific fields."

To achieve this goal, the proposed research explores the possibilities to build magnetic memory devices based on magnetic skyrmions for room-temperature applications featuring in nonvolatile, high density and low-power consumption. A magnetic skyrmion is a particle-like, topologically protected magnetic domain. As a nonvolatile information carrier, each individual skyrmion in a memory device can enable high-density, low-power operations due to the small size, the low driving current density and the extra topological protection. The proposed research will establish a framework for magnetic memory devices using topologically protected spin texture as the information carrier. The impact will be transformative and thus enables the construction of novel magnetic memory. The high-density memory will help accelerate the progress of the big data and internet-of-things era. Meanwhile, when integrated with the CMOS semiconductor technology, it potentially resolves the energy dissipation challenge and thus further advances the technology node. Additionally, this interdisciplinary research also has a vast educational impact, as the new knowledge from the spin orbit coupling engineering will have emerging educational meaning for new students. Students with education level from high school to undergraduate/graduate students, and postdocs (including women and minorities) will be exposed and trained in this inter- and multi-disciplinary and emerging fields of physical science and engineering as well as computer science through PI's participation of the high school and freshman outreach programs at UCLA. The training of students in these emerging disciplines will provide diverse human capital, versed in scientific method and experienced in the applications. The educational impact is further amplified by current outreach programs through the California NanoSystems and the NSF-ERC on Translational Applications of Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems.<br/><br/>Although skyrmions can intrinsically exist in a group of so-called helimagnetic materials (B-20) compounds, skyrmions in magnetic multilayers or interfaces will be more compatible with existing magnetic recording/memory technologies. Thus, the proposed project focuses on the study of skyrmion creation, manipulation and detection in ferromagnetic layer/heavy-material (FM/HM) thin-film systems. This system provides the possibility to furthest adjust and tune the skyrmion properties for application purposes. The creation and annihilation of single, individual skyrmions will be experimentally realized and theoretically analyzed dynamically and statically. The manipulation of skyrmions can be controlled by currents via spin-orbit torque coming from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Each individual skyrmion can be detected using magnetoresistance effect via magnetic tunnel junctions. Single spin textures of single Skyrmions will be modeled via micromagnetic simulation.  Knowledge and experience learnt from this study will enable electrically encoding and decoding of information; the use of commonly accessible thin film material systems with low-temperature process in this research automatically ensures devices to be fully compatible with current CMOS or magnetic recording technology. The proposed research is transformative since it invokes many unique innovations from (1) interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in FM/HM heterostructures to create skyrmion with controllable sizes; (2) effectively manipulation of skyrmion motion by the current-induced spin-orbit torque at the FM/HM interface; (3) the use of high-quality MTJ for information encoding and detection; (4) nanostructure engineering and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA)."

Although rooted in particular social and economic orders,  social inequality also manifests in individual biology and psychology. However, the complex and interacting connections involved are not well understood; physical and mental health disparities can be both the cause and the effect of social inequality. Understanding how these disparities interact is important because they can be mutually-reinforcing and thus difficult to escape once the cycle has begun. The research supported by this award will investigate these linkages through the lens of food insecurity and the pathways that connect it to mental ill health, as mediated by cultural and social differences. Although the research will be conducted outside of the United States to take advantage of analytically useful comparisons, its findings will be universally applicable.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken by anthropologists Dr. Lesley J. Weaver (University of Alabama) and Dr. Craig A. Hadley (Emory University) in three rapidly developing communities in Brazil, Ethiopia, and Haiti.  These research sites were chosen because all three have experienced food shortages in recent memory and in each setting, social inequality is creating noticeable disparities in life chances.  At the same time, the three research sites also differ in scientifically useful ways: they have culturally distinct food cultures and each has a different degree of integration with the global economy. In each site, the researchers will collect information on social and cultural meanings associated with the acquisition, preparation, and consumption of foods; they will do mental and physical health assessments; and they will look at the relationships between these data to weigh the importance of biological (especially nutritional) and cultural factors as pathways that connect food insecurity to mental ill health. Data will be gathered through interviews about health and well-being; participant observation; the collection of basic health biometrics; and the administration of culturally adapted mental health scales. Cross-site comparisons will allow the researchers to assess whether or not there is a shared experience of food insecurity and mental health problems that we are likely to see in other global locations, including the United States. Findings from this research will help to better understand the connection between human society, culture, biology, and psychology. Results also will help to improve the effectiveness of development and aid programs designed to alleviate mental health problems and food insecurity and alleviate some of the harmful effects of social inequality."

This information can be used to design programs to improve instruction and to support student success in algebra. The study involves six community colleges from three states and focuses on three key algebra topics: linear equations, rational equations, and exponential equations. The results will also have applications for mathematics courses at other institutions of higher education. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. <br/><br/>The project will connect both levels of the classroom (students and instructors) in a model that examines personal characteristics of both groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, educational background, student mathematics knowledge, and beliefs about mathematics) and aspects of classroom interaction (e.g., quality of mathematics, quality of instruction). The institutions represent urban, suburban, and rural communities, a range of institution sizes, and three different regions of the United States. A model is proposed for examining these related variables to examine what relationships exist. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected in a mixed methods design in multiple project phases. The first phase will include pilot testing some of the instruments for the project and testing the models. Later phases include data collection and analysis across the institutions. Data collection includes student-level and instructor-level measures. For students, the project will examine measures of mathematics performance, mathematics beliefs, and perceptions of the classroom environment. For instructors, the project will examine knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. Demographic information will be collected for all participants. In addition to the quantitative measures, classroom observations and video analysis will be used to document the nature of instruction."

These results were achieved with modest data volumes ? from ~ 10 seismic stations spanning ~ 10 km ? yet they increased the number of detected earthquakes by a factor of 10 to 100.

Seismicity induced by human activities is an emerging problem that adversely affects energy options for the 21st century, including shale gas development, enhanced geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration. A more complete view of seismicity related to these activities is essential to managing the risks they pose."

The Zika epidemic in the Americas has sparked much confusion and uncertainty, both within the scientific community as well as in the general public. As scientists rapidly identify the best way to reduce mosquito populations and virus transmission, public health professionals will likely need to implement activities to reduce mosquito populations, even before best practice are clearly established and guidelines are officially defined. This may be problematic, because some communities that enact significant mosquito control strategies could have less effective outcomes simply because neighboring communities choose not to invest in mosquito control measures.  This project will integrate statistical models in behavior and disease transmission with the goal of understanding how coordinated mosquito interventions must be in order to be effective.  These models will not only have near term policy benefits for the Zika epidemic, but will have the potential to help inform the response to similar infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.<br/><br/>In the context of significant uncertainty with Zika virus, it is important for policy makers to understand how much coordination of control efforts are needed for effective protection from Zika virus.  In the face of limited coordination, for instance across regional, state, or international boundaries, are there ways to enact independent control efforts to compensate for asynchrony and still achieve effective protection? The investigators will develop three models: A) a simple vector-borne disease dynamic differential equations model, B) a spatially explicit individual based simulation model and C) a feedback control model that builds on the first two. Together, these models will generate answers to policy-relevant questions about coordination of vector control"

They are condensed ways of presenting information about people, organizations, or their products and activities. They take different forms and come from different sources. However, only some of these ratings have gained tremendous regulatory power over the lives of individuals and organizations as they evaluate compliance with certain standards of behavior. Most scholars and analysts regard ratings? regulatory power an inevitable, natural and functional response to conditions of increasing market expansion and uncertainty. This project examines the evolution of ratings and their sources for two large sectors - finance and healthcare - in the United States. In both fields ratings with regulatory power come from a few specialized private agencies. The recognition by law of those few specialized private agencies - credit rating and hospital accrediting agencies respectively - as legitimate sources of information to evaluate organizations? worth, is a key moment in the history of ratings for both fields. How and why were specific private agencies recognized as legitimate sources of ratings instead of alternative governmental or professional forms of regulation? How did ratings gain their regulatory power over healthcare and financial organizations? What was the role of the state and law in the emergence of ratings as a new institution? How did their meaning change over time? The answers to these questions will highlight institutional configurations without neglecting the agents that make possible their maintenance, change and stability. They also contribute to the demystification of new regulatory forms as inevitable, natural and functional outcomes necessitated by conditions of uncertainty and increasing market expansion. The comparison of two different fields helps reveal the interdependences of different fields and the crucial role policy makers play in shaping new forms of regulation: legitimizing them, contributing to their implementation, and mediating their power to shape social life. <br/><br/>This project will combine data on congressional records and hearings about the formal recognition in federal legislation of certain specialized private agencies as legitimate sources of ratings, organizational histories and accounts, examinations of field specific publications, and newspaper data to trace the processes through which regulation-by-information emerged as a new institutional form in two major fields of activity in the US. It uses theories of institutional emergence to examine the political and cultural struggles surrounding the emergence of ratings by certain specialized private agencies as regulation-by-information and the sidelining of alternative sources of ratings like associations or government agencies. The project aims to clarify the meaning of ratings, the conditions under which they constitute ?regulation-by-information,? and present a more coherent framework for examining other emerging forms of regulation."

Gay men earn less than comparable heterosexual men, and studies have shown that both gay men and lesbian women face hiring discrimination. Despite these initial studies establishing labor market inequalities for gay men and lesbian women, there remains little evidence to explain why the disadvantages exist. Multiple competing explanations exist, including: (a) disadvantaging stereotypes that link sexual orientation with assumptions of competence and ability, (b) stereotypes of gay men and lesbian women as less masculine/feminine than heterosexual men and women, and (c) a society and labor market that have preferences for traditional masculine behavior in high status occupations and leadership positions. <br/><br/>The investigator will complete two laboratory studies, two survey experiments, and a test with nationally representative survey data to examine hiring discrimination and the mechanisms underlying unequal treatment. Study 1 tests for hiring discrimination in entry-level jobs using both a controlled laboratory experiment and a survey experiment in a diverse sample. Study 2 examines hiring discrimination for positions of senior leadership using a controlled laboratory study and a survey experiment in a diverse sample. Study 3 uses nationally representative survey data to examine the existing patterns of labor market inequalities. The experimental studies provide key causal evidence of discrimination and the ability to test for underlying mechanisms, while the survey data provides generalizable and representative evidence. The project will provide key evidence to help address existing inequalities and will also serve as a training site for student research assistants who will learn experimental research techniques and methodology while working on the project."

A potential hydrogen economy is a key player in this market<br/>space. However, hydrogen as a fuel requires efficient storage materials that retain and release<br/>a great deal of hydrogen as desired. This proposal aims to use large scale and accurate quantum<br/>mechanical calculations on an important class of porous hydrogen storage materials: metal-organic<br/>frameworks (MOFs). The research team will study the properties of hydrogen inside of MOFs<br/>and seek to understand their physical properties and how one can design improved MOFs that<br/>should deliver improved storage of hydrogen per unit weight under reasonable and real-world<br/>operating conditions.<br/><br/>To understand and improve MOFs for hydrogen storage applications, it is key to study the microscopic<br/>physical properties of MOFs that govern hydrogen uptake, release, and diffusion<br/>inside the MOFs. This requires simulation of hydrogen inside of MOFs at the atomistic scale.<br/>The project propose to perform highly accurate quantum mechanical simulations of hydrogen dynamics<br/>inside of MOFs using first principles density functional theory to describe the electronic<br/>state of the system coupled to molecular dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom including<br/>quantum nuclear effects (via the path integral formalism). The effect due to the quantum<br/>fluctuations of the nuclear degrees of freedom are critical for understanding the binding<br/>and dynamics of light elements such as hydrogen. The project will use this advanced and accurate theoretical<br/>framework to address three questions of key importance to this field: (1) How do quantum<br/>nuclear effects alter hydrogen dynamics inside of MOFs? (2) How do the transition metal atoms<br/>incorporated into the MOF structure change the hydrogen binding and dynamics properties and<br/>which metals are best for real-world applications? (3) How does the flexibility and temperature-dependent<br/>fluctuations of the MOF framework affect hydrogen storage?<br/><br/>The scientific outcomes of this research will be of interest and importance to researchers<br/>studying MOFs and hydrogen storage. The aim is to provide useful understanding and information<br/>that may lead to the creation of materials that will help create a hydrogen economy. The<br/>results of the work will be published in high quality journals, presented widely at international<br/>conferences, and form the basis for outreach events to the broader public in order to elevate<br/>general interest in science and technology as well as how simulations and computations can<br/>address important real-world problems. Junior researchers carrying out the research work<br/>will be trained in the use of advanced computational methods, attendant software infrastructures,<br/>and materials design approaches that are all highly useful skills in the twenty-first century."

Similarity search has been used to understand the mechanics of tectonic tremor, transform our understanding of the depth dependence of faulting, illuminate diffusion within aftershock seismicity, and reveal new insights into induced earthquakes. These results were achieved with modest data volumes ? from ~ 10 seismic stations spanning ~ 10 km ? yet they increased the number of detected earthquakes by a factor of 10 to 100. This geoinformatics project will develop the cyberinfrastructure required to enable high-sensitivity studies of earthquake processes through the discovery of previously undetected seismic events within massive data volumes.<br/><br/>This goal of this project is to develop a cyberinfrastructure to mine seismic waveform data. The effort will develop methods and hardware to use coherent signal processing on very large waveform databases to detect, locate and characterize events that cannot be detected by standard network operations (detection of single arrivals, association, location by optimization). <br/><br/>The methodology involves the use of a network-based approach for earthquake detection, especially weak and unusual events that in the current method of treating signals individually go unreported. The PIs will work on the large T and the large N problem, where large T is using waveform similarity of multiple events over time to detect earthquakes over long periods of time; and the large N is using waveform similarity of single events over space as recorded on a dense seismic array with up to thousands of stations.<br/><br/>The results will greatly increase knowledge of the number of seismic sources of various kinds and potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. Seismicity induced by human activities is an emerging problem that adversely affects energy options for the 21st century, including shale gas development, enhanced geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration. A more complete view of seismicity related to these activities is essential to managing the risks they pose."

Important decisions about another person are often based on first impressions. Impressions can include the emotional state a person is feeling at that moment, or ""affect"", and how that person generally thinks and acts: his or her personality traits. Making accurate judgments has vital effects on the actions people take. Judging that a person's affect is positive or negative allows people to decide whether approach or avoidance is best at that moment. Accurately judging traits is useful for the ""who"" and ""how"" of social living. People determine whom to approach with what goal in mind, and they anticipate how such interactions might unfold. Making good decisions in a variety of contexts is likely to lead to quality relationships or collaborations and avoidance of negative ones. This, in turn, may increase well-being, employee satisfaction, and productivity. Although accurately judging both affect and stable traits is crucial to making high quality decisions, researchers have developed models of these two kinds of judgments independent of each other. The current project provides an innovative merging of these areas of research, producing a model of how accuracy across these judgment areas may be related. The investigators will test the newly developed State and Trait Accuracy Model in four experiments. In addition, the project provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and engagement in science for students in primary schools.  <br/><br/>This project tests two hypotheses about the relationship and causal direction of people's accuracy in judging affect and judging traits. The State and Trait Accuracy Model predicts a positive relationship between such judgments, and further predicts that judgments of affect precede accurate judgments of personality traits. To test hypotheses about the accuracy of judging strangers, it is essential to have stimuli that display genuine emotions and responses, rather than staged or artificial affective displays. Thus, researchers from the three universities involved in this project have developed a validated database of stimuli consisting of videotapes of individuals whose personality traits and emotional state have been assessed. In the current project, experiments will use segments of these videotapes as stimuli for observers to make affect and trait judgments. Four experiments involve manipulating observers' judgmental focus and manipulating the validity of affect and trait information, either by mislabeling or by natural incongruences. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved as researchers and participants in the project, providing research training opportunities. Children in local primary schools will benefit by exposure to presentations and research design experiences provided in their schools. Another benefit of this project is that the infrastructure for research is enhanced via this collaboration of researchers at three North American universities. In addition, society can benefit from an increased understanding of how affective states and personality traits can be judged more accurately--something useful to people in daily life as well as to professionals. For instance, the U.S. economy may benefit from employers being better able to determine the fit between applicants and jobs."

If you have eaten rice, you have eaten endosperm, the starchy portion that fills the majority of the rice grain. Since the emergence of agriculture, humans have selected and bred seeds with a larger and starchier endosperm portion, ultimately creating the crop varieties we now depend upon. Endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed, now provides an estimated 67% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide, and improving on these varieties remains of fundamental importance. Thus, from both an agricultural and food security perspective the development of the endosperm is critical to humankind's survival.  This research will investigate the genes that control endosperm development and the molecular and evolutionary interactions between the endosperm and the embryo in the monkey flower (genus Mimulus). Although not eaten by humans, due to its ecological and evolutionary history, Mimulus provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary and molecular aspects of the interactions between endosperm and embryo.  As these interactions regulate the growth of the endosperm and thus the size of the nutritious portion of the seed in agricultural varieties, the results of this research in Mimulus are expected to engender a molecular understanding of a developmental process critical to human agricultural productivity.<br/><br/>Recent evidence links the evolutionary theory of parent-offspring conflict over maternal resources to the evolution of epigenetically imprinted genes controlling normal seed endosperm development. In interploidy hybrids, dosage-sensitivity of paternal and maternal allelic expression in developing endosperm is critical to normal development, and disruption leads to seed abortion. As yet it remains unknown whether such conflict over embryo provisioning leads to evolutionary divergence of imprinted genes or their targets, and ultimately hybrid seed lethality, in diploid species. The investigators propose to test this possibility by determining the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying species divergence in endosperm development and leading to hybrid seed abortion, a principal isolating barrier in the Mimulus guttatus sp. complex. This research integrates genomic, molecular genetic and developmental biology approaches, utilizing high-throughput genome mapping, RNA sequencing technologies, and transgenic techniques to elucidate the genetic mechanisms contributing to seed abortion in M. guttatus x M. nudatus crosses. In so doing, it examines questions of fundamental interest to evolutionary biologists (how are new species formed?), and to developmental biologists (how is endosperm growth regulated?) while addressing a question of interest to both: what molecular changes might rapidly evolve when the mother's need to regulate growth and development differs from that of her offspring?  Answering these questions will shed light on the developmental processes regulating endosperm growth and the evolutionary mechanisms driving divergence in flowering plants."

Such a DEM set is needed for measuring and understanding rapid, ongoing changes to the Arctic landscape resulting from climate change and human use, as well as mitigation and adaptation planning for Arctic communities. Resources for obtaining and maintaining the imagery, tools for post-processing the results, software development time, and methods for distributing the DEM have been secured.

As part of a coordinated effort among researchers from multiple universities, countries, and disciplines, the project strengthens multi-national research, training, and teaching partnerships in producing policy-relevant scientific research. It integrates research and education through cascade mentoring, which includes senior and junior scholars and graduate and undergraduate students, from two liberal arts colleges and a large research university in the development of innovative methodology and theory-building in global environmental governance. Through rigorous theoretical and methodological training for graduate and undergraduate students, the project helps them to develop the skills and knowledge to apply geographic concepts and methods to pressing global environmental issues, while simultaneously exposing them to potential careers in environmental research and policy. By illuminating the complexities of how actors influence global environmental governance, it reveals avenues for redressing seemingly intractable environmental crises and global inequality at a critical historical moment.<br/><br/>The project challenges state-centric understandings of global environmental governance and advances new theories about how contemporary governance occurs. It augments traditional field-based studies of conservation with ethnographic data in order to trace how paradigm shifts occur in global conservation politics. Specifically, the project analyzes how global conservation governance transpires across multiple institutional sites by focusing on international conferences as key venues in which diverse actors, who are normally dispersed in time and space, convene to negotiate. It attends to the types of strategies that diverse actors use and the ways in which conference norms, structures, forms of acceptable knowledge and measurement shape the ways in which these actors interact and influence negotiations, revealing how and why certain actors are better able than others to catalyze paradigm shifts. Ultimately, it documents how paradigm shifts occur not only through official discourse, policy and law, but also through more informal, everyday interactions among public, private and non-profit actors."

At its core, politics involves human interaction. For too long politics has been studied as a process focused on individuals, where scholars have understood that individuals' incentives and choices are shaped by the rules and institutions around them. This tradition comes from economics, largely. However, as a social science, it is imperative for scholars to ask and answer puzzles about politics that recognize the relational nature of politics. Political actions cannot be understood in the absence of a recognition that political actors' choices are dependent on others in their network. This is true about voters, legislators, dictators, countries, and all types of political actors. This award provides supplemental support for PhD students and junior faculty to travel to attend the Political Networks Conference and Training Workshops. The resources provided by this grant are dedicated to support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and under-funded assistant professors, expand diversity efforts, extend mentoring and networking efforts, and encourage the development and dissemination of new methods and theories appropriate for the specific needs of subfields brought together by an interest in studying political networks. The training workshops leverage participants' strengths in training and mentoring to advance the field of political networks and foster interdisciplinary ties in this important methodological area.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This is a particularly promising period for the development of network studies in politics.  Extensive big data sets, expanded computational capabilities, and newly-developed analytic techniques have reduced many of the past obstacles to the serious study of political networks.  Hence the study of political networks is at an important juncture, supported by newly established interdisciplinary organizations, an organized section, and training efforts that are currently underway.  As a consequence, network studies have gained supporters and practitioners in virtually every area of political study; political institutions,  comparative politics, political behavior, international relations, public policy, parties and elections, public opinion, interest groups, social movements, and political communication. The resources provided by this grant are dedicated to support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and under-funded assistant professors, expand diversity efforts, extend mentoring and networking efforts, and encourage the development and dissemination of new methods and theories appropriate for the specific needs of subfields brought together by an interest in studying political networks. The training workshops leverage participants' strengths in training and mentoring to advance the field of political networks and foster interdisciplinary ties in this important methodological area. The training and conference is interdisciplinary by design, and it is exciting to see deep and extensive engagement across disciplines. The grant is aimed specifically to achieve training and learning for participants.  In addition, the goal is that participants then take what they learn and move it into their graduate and undergraduate teaching and contribute to quantitative social science programs at their home institutions."

These estimates are urgently needed but difficult to obtain because of inaccuracies in blood tests and under reporting of infections. Using existing serum samples together with mathematical modeling, the project will fill knowledge gaps about i) transmission parameters for Zika, ii) the consistency of surveillance approaches, and iii) the global risk of Zika transmission. This approach will also capture information about other viral infections (e.g., chikungunya and dengue) and the potential for future spread. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.<br/><br/>This project will use mathematical models informed by sample serology to estimate the transmission potential for Zika across the globe. Currently, the utility of inference is limited with surveillance reports alone and traditional serological methods, the latter because of cross-reactivity between arboviruses. This project will use a new low-cost, high throughput assay to test for the historic exposure of different antibodies for Zika and other arboviruses. It will compare the rate susceptible individuals in communities that acquire different arboviruses over time. From these results, geostatistical models to predict the force of infection will be developed and risk maps for Zika and other arboviruses will be validated. This knowledge will be used to characterize the shared epidemiology of arboviral diseases around the world."

If you have eaten rice, you have eaten endosperm, the starchy portion that fills the majority of the rice grain. Since the emergence of agriculture, humans have selected and bred seeds with a larger and starchier endosperm portion, ultimately creating the crop varieties we now depend upon. Endosperm, either directly or indirectly through animal feed, now provides an estimated 67% of the calories consumed by humans worldwide, and improving on these varieties remains of fundamental importance. Thus, from both an agricultural and food security perspective the development of the endosperm is critical to humankind's survival.  This research will investigate the genes that control endosperm development and the molecular and evolutionary interactions between the endosperm and the embryo in the monkey flower (genus Mimulus). Although not eaten by humans, due to its ecological and evolutionary history, Mimulus provides a unique opportunity to study evolutionary and molecular aspects of the interactions between endosperm and embryo.  As these interactions regulate the growth of the endosperm and thus the size of the nutritious portion of the seed in agricultural varieties, the results of this research in Mimulus are expected to engender a molecular understanding of a developmental process critical to human agricultural productivity. This research will inspire new high school biology teaching modules in genetics, evolution, and plant developmental biology that highlight the importance of the endosperm to humankind's diet, as well as the roles of pollinators and reproductive barriers in generating the diversity of life through the evolutionary process.<br/><br/>Recent evidence links the evolutionary theory of parent-offspring conflict over maternal resources to the evolution of epigenetically imprinted genes controlling normal seed endosperm development. In interploidy hybrids, dosage-sensitivity of paternal and maternal allelic expression in developing endosperm is critical to normal development, and disruption leads to seed abortion. As yet it remains unknown whether such conflict over embryo provisioning leads to evolutionary divergence of imprinted genes or their targets, and ultimately hybrid seed lethality, in diploid species. The investigators propose to test this possibility by determining the genetic basis and evolutionary mechanisms underlying species divergence in endosperm development and leading to hybrid seed abortion, a principal isolating barrier in the Mimulus guttatus sp. complex. This research integrates genomic, molecular genetic and developmental biology approaches, utilizing high-throughput genome mapping, RNA sequencing technologies, and transgenic techniques to elucidate the genetic mechanisms contributing to seed abortion in M. guttatus x M. nudatus crosses. In so doing, it examines questions of fundamental interest to evolutionary biologists (how are new species formed?), and to developmental biologists (how is endosperm growth regulated?) while addressing a question of interest to both: what molecular changes might rapidly evolve when the mother's need to regulate growth and development differs from that of her offspring?  Answering these questions will shed light on the developmental processes regulating endosperm growth and the evolutionary mechanisms driving divergence in flowering plants."

How we perceive and manage these threats is related to a number of factors including how ""real"" the threat feels (its risk salience), our confidence in the sources of information alerting us to the threat and its potential consequences, our faith in the effectiveness of an intervention and in our ability to employ it, and our reliance upon psychological leanings that propel us to being risk-tolerant or risk-averse. The newly emerging Zika virus is a window into many of these facets, and a critically-important opportunity for those engaged in public health risk communication. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the U.S. public's appreciation of the risk of Zika virus over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. By collecting a series of four cross-sectional population surveys over the course of a year, this research illustrates how risk salience evolves, and the extent to which it may be influenced by specific communication and information channels. Analyses reveal how social, scientific, and policy discourse contribute to public understandings of risk and further our understandings of communication strategies. Understanding how messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats. These findings contribute to the literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It also helps develop more refined and effective risk communication strategies when populations are faced with the threat of a novel pathogen. Overall, this research contributes to several disciplinary perspectives, notably those of risk assessment, hazard-related decision making, and public health risk communication.<br/><br/>The rising attention to the Zika virus offers an opportunity to examine how risk salience evolves in real-time as the threat approaches. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapies for the Zika viral infection, and there is still limited scientific understanding of the virus itself, the vectors, the disease pathogenesis, or even the epidemiology. The opportunity to measure and chart the U.S. public's perception of this threat - and how it is influenced by social, scientific, and policy cues - is time-bound, as the geographic exposure to the virus expands over time, and the data are ephemeral. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the US public's perception of the risk over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. The specific aims of the research are to: (1) chart the trajectory of risk salience as exposure and certainty of the Zika virus increases; (2) identify and analyze the impact of social, scientific, and policy cues and discourse on risk salience; and (3) describe and analyze group differences in the evolving attitudes related to risk perception, as well as receptivity to policy, programmatic, and clinical interventions. Two data sets are developed to investigate these research aims. The first is a repeated cross-sectional national phone survey with an oversample of women of child-bearing age in the US Southern Tier (selected as a sub-population of particular vulnerability), totaling 1,200 respondents. These data are collected quarterly over a year-long period. In parallel with the primary data, a second data set quantifies the number and type of social, scientific, and policy cues observed in sentinel media sources during the time period immediately preceding the survey work. The research team merges these media data with the primary data and tests for their association with respondents? risk salience. The findings contribute to the overall literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It is possible that messaging will change over time as the number of Zika cases increases in the US, as the number of microcephalic infant births increase, and as dramatic stories are reported with greater frequency in the press. Demonstrating how this messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats."

Despite the gravity of this problem, few systematic attempts have been made to design and evaluate feasible, scalable ways to enhance revenue collection and public sector performance. Through four related but distinct studies, this project will fill this gap by examining the impact of incentive policies on public employee performance, as well as the roles of citizen engagement and tax collectors' ability on revenue collection. Given the critical importance of these issues and the embedded and sustained nature of the researcher-policymaker partnerships, the results will provide practical guidance on increasing tax revenues to a large audience of policymakers worldwide. <br/><br/>While there has been significant work done on the optimal design of statutory taxes (e.g., Pomeranz 2014, Kleven and Waseem 2013), there has been less focus on increasing revenue and enforcement within a given system of taxation. This project seeks to explore enforcement and compliance issues contributing to the low collection of urban property taxes and examine the effectiveness of schemes designed to address those issues. The project consists of four studies. The first is a new randomized trial that addresses tax morale and the willingness of citizens to pay taxes. This component seeks to strengthen the link between tax payment and service provision by eliciting taxpayers' service preferences and sharing this information with their local governments. Localities will be randomly assigned to either receive the information from this preference elicitation or not, and those that receive it will be randomly assigned to allocate a portion of their budgets based on taxpayer preferences or to spend as normal. Tracking revenues, allocations, service provision, and citizen beliefs will provide a clean empirical estimate of the impact of these schemes on taxpayer attitudes and actual revenues. The next two studies focus on incentivizing tax collector performance. In the second study, tax collectors were randomly assigned to compete for preferable job postings based on their performance, which was measured by the increase in recovery or the tax base. This design allows for clean testing of the impact of these non-financial incentives on revenues and collector behavior, which will be analyzed during the course of this project. The third study will evaluate the long-term impacts of a previous study, in which tax collectors were randomly assigned to receive performance pay for two years based on revenue collection, audits, and/or subjective ratings. This performance pay ended two years ago, and the current study will determine whether this past period of performance pay had a persistent effect on tax collection' information that can help design the optimal duration for and interval between such schemes. The final study will analyze the impact of individual inspectors' characteristics on revenues by using the overlap of different collectors in the same region to separate individual from regional effects."

Since there are no existing guidelines or best practices to guide such research, the results of the project will be transformative for researchers and collaborators in the field. Moreover, it will have a ripple effect through development of educational materials to prepare future researchers to understand and give priority to their responsibilities when conducting collaborative research with non-scientists. Remote sensing and VGI generate geolocated data used not just by scientists, but also by practitioners with little scientific training seeking to intervene in crisis situations, which often unfold in remote and dangerous locations inhabited by vulnerable populations and may involve human rights abuses, humanitarian and disaster responses, and threats to cultural heritage during conflict.  Hence, the project will not only promote the ethical and rigorous use of these techniques for researchers, it will also guide the work of stakeholders outside academia, a crucial step to reducing risks to populations. Given the global settings in which crises emerge, this project reaches beyond traditional scholarly audiences to disseminate research findings and approaches. It will include non-scientist users and the voices of under-represented groups, such as people in the developing world and women, in order to diversify discussions on the best ways to protect on-the-ground researchers, the volunteers of information, and those threatened by the misuse or careless distribution of geolocated information. <br/><br/>Geographers are well-positioned to develop and apply remote sensing and VGI approaches to socially important issues. Nevertheless, methodological lapses may impede further progress. Some methodological issues addressed by this project include: data provenance; quality control in data collection and analysis; representativeness of the collected data; and potential data gaps due to factors such as gender and access to technology. These are core matters for how a professional discipline establishes standards for assessing the rigor and accuracy of its methods and instrumentation, and how it applies those methods in an ethically acceptable manner. While such matters fall into the domain of the profession, they cannot be understood fully in the present day social context without dialogue with non-scientist users. Two key research questions explored by this study include:<br/><br/>1. What standards are needed for the collection, analysis, use and dissemination of geolocated data during crisis situations? Operating without standards endangers the safety and security of people on the ground and complicates efforts to identify appropriate policy and interventions to protect and assist populations. <br/>2. What are the best means for engaging a diverse set of geographers and users in developing and disseminating those standards - ethical principles and guidelines and best practices - so they are accepted and implemented in studies that use geolocated data in crisis situations?<br/><br/>These and other questions will be addressed through a series of invitational workshops and solicitations of feedback from stakeholder communities. Participants will be drawn from the international academic, humanitarian, cultural heritage, crisis mapping, disaster, and human rights communities."

Tendon injuries are very common and are difficult to treat successfully, in part because of the limited understanding of how mechanical loads transfer through the structures within tendons. Forces applied at the large-scale are transmitted down to the level of cells, which changes the tendon responds biologically. Unfortunately, it remains unclear which components within the complex tendon structure are responsible for force transfer. At the smallest level a tendon has long collagen molecules connected together by other molecule one group of which is flexible and another that is quite stiff.  The relative amount of stiff and flexible connections between the collagen molecules determines how strong and stiff the tendon is.  However, how the two types of molecular linkages interact to make the tendon strong and stiff mechanically is not properly understood.  This gap in knowledge has made it difficult to completely determine how healthy tendons function and how their force-transmission capabilities change after injury.  The project will measure the properties of tendons with different amounts of the two linker types and create a model of the tendon built up from the molecular level in order to understand how it functions mechanically at a very basic level.  The better model for the tendon has the potential to benefit society by reducing pain, disability, and healthcare costs associated with tendon injuries. This research project includes a number of educational goals.  Among them is to build an interactive class section on how mechanics is important in understanding biological materials for a K-12 audience to attract students into STEM fields. Another is to improve a graduate biomechanics course using fundamental concepts of multi-scale mechanics such as are used in this research project.  The advanced material in that improved course will train the next generation of scientists needed to continue research in the area. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to determine the role of two specific linking components in tendon mechanics: enzymatic collagen crosslinks and elastic fibers. These tissue constituents are important for mechanical load carriage in tendon, however how they change mechanical properties is not understood in a detailed way. This project will use a combined experimental and computational approach to determine the multiscale mechanical role of these linking components in tendon. Animal models of altered collagen crosslinks and impaired elastic fiber assemblies will be evaluated using biomechanical testing combined with two-photon microscopy and polarized light imaging. Experiments will be complemented with a collagen network computational model to determine individual and coupled mechanical effects of linking components, and evaluate hypotheses on force transmission across length scales. This study will greatly improve understanding of: (1) fundamental tendon mechanics, including the role of linking components across structural levels; (2) effects of complementary or coupled interactions between linking elements; (3) how altered quantities/types of linking components lead to impaired mechanical function; and (4) potential therapeutic applications of controlled modifications to linking components to prevent tissue damage or injury progression. The experimental approach and computational framework provide an excellent system to study fundamental relations that extends to other soft tissues. These concepts could also motivate new ideas in material design and inspire new ways to think about force transfer and assembly of multiscale materials."

The award to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to investigate multiscale thermal transport and energetics of phase change inside self-assembled nanoemulsions in a non-invasive way through characterization of thermophysical properties and structural dynamics at precisely controlled interfacial structure, surface chemistry and external fields. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and high school students are involved in the project. The principal investigator also offers tutorials at conferences, conducts a research symposium and workshop on multiscale thermal transport at UDC, and invites collaborators to give talks to students and faculty. <br/><br/>The work is expected to reveal the fundamentals of intermolecular thermal transport and interfacial thermodynamics inside self-assembled nanoemulsions. The following questions will be addressed: How can different surface effects such as wettability be separated from roughness on boiling heat transfer? Can the highly disordered nucleate boiling process including bubble dynamics be precisely controlled? and What are the mechanisms behind boiling in micro/nanosized confined space and how do they affect phase change heat transfer? The questions will be answered by obtaining high spatial- and temporal-resolution data of boiling heat transfer and bubble dynamics of the phase changeable self-assembled nanoemulsions on a customized heater via a synchronized high speed camera and infrared thermography. A simulation model that can predict the multiscale and multiphase thermal transport processes of colloidal fluids on micro/nanostructured surfaces will be developed. The knowledge obtained from this project will contribute to a better understanding of multiscale and multiphase thermal transport, provide critical technical and simulation solutions to enable rational design of advanced thermal management systems, and promote further development of next-generation communication, medical and energy technologies."

This proposal aims to uncover the basic principles that direct how organisms tailor their physiological responses to environmental changes.  Understanding why certain responses occur requires a precise map showing which genes are regulated in a given response and how they are coordinated.  Using prior NSF ABI support, the Baliga Laboratory at the Institute for Systems Biology developed an approach to create precise maps of gene regulation for any microbial species. Using this approach, they mapped gene regulation in a set of important organisms including uranium-reducing Desulfovibrio vulgaris, lipid-accumulating Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, yeast, diatoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The next goal is to see how well the maps work as tools to predict the results when manipulating complex behaviors. Effective tools have wide-ranging implications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. Initially, new algorithms and software will be developed to further refine the gene regulation maps and identify factors affecting gene regulation during environmental changes. The focus will be understanding how organisms switch on or off specific behaviors in response to environmental cues. The work will be performed in two organisms - E. coli, a well-known, widely studied bacterium, and Halobacterium salinarum, an extremophile that thrives in high salt environments; it will be readily applicable to all sequenced microorganisms that are of significant industrial, agricultural, and medical importance. Part of the project is to develop and disseminate new high school curriculum to introduce the importance of computational modeling in solving real world problems such as food scarcity and climate change. Diverse populations of students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds, including those currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), will receive training and sustained support as they learn this interdisciplinary science. This curriculum and training is part of a program called Systems Education Experiences (SEE) that reaches thousands of students and teachers each month. SEE works toward cultivating systems thinkers who can tackle problems, contribute to a STEM-literate citizenry, and help build a more diverse population of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to develop a framework to elucidate and predictably manipulate the gene regulatory program of any microbe. In previous ABI-funded research, the Baliga lab developed a systems approach to reverse engineer the environment and gene regulatory influence network v2.0 (EGRIN 2.0) model directly from a compendium of transcriptome profiles. The EGRIN 2.0 model elucidates mechanisms for environment-specific transcriptional regulation of all genes with unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution, at canonical promoter locations and even within coding sequences and inside operons. Here, an approach will be developed to elucidate transcription factor interactions within EGRIN 2.0 and characterize how the topology of these interactions (i.e., 'network motifs') generates genome-wide, temporally coordinated transcriptional responses. These studies will be performed in the context of understanding how two phylogenetically distant organisms --Escherichia coli (a bacterium) and Halobacterium salinarum (an archaeaon)-- use distinct regulators to mediate physiologically different yet phenotypically similar transitions from aerobic growth to anaerobic quiescence. First, an approach will be developed to precisely map conditional binding of transcription factors to sequence elements within promoters of all genes in the genome (EGRIN 3.0). Next, EGRIN 3.0 will be used to identify, characterize, and manipulate topologies of transcription factor interactions (i.e., network motifs) to predictably alter oxygen (O2)-responsive state transitions in H. salinarum and E. coli. In addition to developing a generalized framework for manipulating a microbial gene regulatory program within any organism, the activities will test the hypothesis that similar environmental forcing drives convergent evolution of topologically similar network motifs in phylogenetically distant organisms. The high-level thinking and process used by this interdisciplinary group will be translated into curriculum and training experiences in the form of real-word cases studies for high school teachers and students. One of the goals will be for students to use experimentation and modeling to better understand the influence of environmental parameters (such as oxygen, nitrates, pH, light, etc.) on productivity and stability of food systems, such as aquaponic systems. Students, teachers, and STEM professionals will work together to iteratively develop and test curriculum and experiences through a modified Dick and Carey Instructional Design model. All curricula will be integrated with published national education standards. All needed technology, software, lesson plans and learning aides will be provided to teachers and students through multiple online sources, resource centers, and in-person and online trainings.

Yet, despite impressive growth in attention to social entrepreneurship, surprisingly little is known about when, how and why it succeeds or fails in addressing social problems. Beyond theoretical contributions of interest to scholars, the project has potential implications for the expanding regional, national and supranational institutions that have turned to social entrepreneurship in the face of scarce public funding and growing socio-economic inequalities. Study findings could possibly offer valuable insights for tailoring social entrepreneurship policies to local needs, opportunities, and power structures, as well as for identifying when alternative (or additional) actors and initiatives might be leveraged to address poverty and social exclusion.<br/><br/>This dissertation uses mixed methods to investigate the factors and mechanisms that help and/or hinder social entrepreneurship in addressing poverty and social exclusion. The empirical context is social entrepreneurship in Paris and its surrounding 'banlieues' -  communities marked by disproportionate levels of poverty, unemployment and additional forms of exclusion. Part I uses national-level quantitative data (an original dataset of 1033 French social enterprises selected on the basis of organizational form and entrepreneurial profile) to investigate the conditions under which social entrepreneurs/enterprises succeed or fail in terms of their economic survival and social mission(s). Using event history analysis (2002-2015), the project analyzes the founding and survival rates of social enterprises based on their geographic location, sector of activity, founder and community characteristics, and commercial and social organizational missions. Part II relies on semi-structured interviews to investigate how different actors construct the meaning of success, failure and impact in social entrepreneurship, and the mechanisms that limit SE's ability to reduce social exclusion in communities. Interviews are conducted with three groups of actors in the Ile-de-France region of France: (1) founders/current directors of social enterprises, (2) strategic directors of organizations providing support (e.g., financial, training, mentorship, networking) to social entrepreneurs and enterprises, and (3) ""unsuccessful"" social entrepreneurs who had an entrepreneurial idea but did not ultimately found an organization and/or whose social enterprise was dissolved within a year of establishment. Interviews are transcribed and translated from French, analyzed first inductively, then systematically using qualitative coding software (Atlas.ti). The quantitative dataset, findings, codebook, and aggregate summary data from Atlas.ti will be made available to the public, while executive summaries will be provided to each participating organization/individual as well as interested policy-makers and public institutions."

When such systems include flexible components, motion results in vibration or oscillation.  In these cases, achieving the desired output is challenging and may require additional energy usage or complex sensors.  Also, many existing control solutions do not perform well when the system parameters or configurations change. This project seeks to commercialize a control solution for such systems driven by stepper motors.  The proposed solution limits vibration caused by stepper motors, which improves efficiency, increases safety, and decreases energy consumption. Extensive customer discovery will be conducted in order to better understand the specific needs and performance requirements of flexible systems driven by stepper motors.<br/><br/>Stepper motor actuation sequences can be designed to limit undesired vibration using input-shaping design techniques.  The primary challenge encountered in designing input shapers for stepper motors and other on-off actuators is the inherent discretization in both command amplitude and time. Analytic input-shaped stepper motor profiles for short-distance motion commands for lightly-damped flexible systems have been developed. These commands can be made robust to modeling error in the natural frequency of the undesired vibratory mode. The potential for commercialization of this technology will be explored by interviewing potential customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, material handling, and process industries. Additional desired characteristics for the stepping motor control sequences and other application areas may be discovered during this process."

The goal of IWBDA is to make biology more easily, robustly, reliably, and predictably engineered and therefore, tackle challenges in biology and medicine, leading to advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. <br/>	<br/>Existing synthetic biology conferences and meetings do not explicitly focus on bridging the gap between the work of experimentalists and computational researchers. Bridging this divide is essential for the field of synthetic biology to fulfill its promise. Furthermore, other venues do not actively include the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) community, which can bring a wide range of experiences, expertise, and perspectives to the design of novel biological systems. IWBDA includes keynote and invited talks, tutorials, poster sessions, panel discussions, as well as dedicated time for informal discussions. <br/>		<br/>The intellectual merit of this workshop is a key strength. This workshop will provide a venue for between twelve and fifteen technical talks over two days. These talks are chosen from two page extended abstracts which are later archived. In addition, there will be two invited lectures, ten to twenty posters, multiple group discussion sessions, and  a featured student programming competition (BDAthlon). Technical topics will be diverse and include areas such as: Parts and Standardization, Biological Circuit Simulators, Biological Circuit Design, CAD Tools for Synthetic Biology and Gene Network Reconstruction.  No other such workshop exists in Synthetic Biology/EDA.<br/><br/>	<br/>The broader impacts of IWBDA are numerous. A wide variety of researchers (120+) from EDA and synthetic biology will be brought together in a unique context which does not exist elsewhere. IWBDA will capture and make public the slides, posters, and abstracts from the session. In addition, a user survey will be created to learn more about how workshops like this can better serve the community. Finally, there will be numerous undergraduate, graduate and post graduate student researchers in attendance. IWBDA encourages and supports woman and underrepresented minority student participation and has a diverse technical program and executive committees.<br/><br/>In keeping with its goal of establishing international collaborations and research efforts, IWBDA 2016 will take place at Newcastle University in England. The co-general chairs are Prof. Anil Wipat from Newcastle and Prof. Pietro Lio' from Cambridge. The program chair is Prof. Chris French from the University of Edinburgh. A keynote speaker is Prof. Natalio Krasnogor from Newcastle University. We expect Newcastle, Cambridge, Imperial College, and the University of Edinburgh (among other UK based universities) all to send participants at the graduate to principle investigator level. <br/><br/>NSF support (Funding provided from the Directorate of Computer Information Science and Engineering and the Office of International Science and Engineering is gratefully acknowledged) ensures a technical and diverse set of undergraduate, graduate, and post doctorial students can attend the conference to present research, learn more about the field, and expand their networking opportunities."

This patented device is the first such structure to genuinely exhibit selective tunneling at room temperature using a scalable printable process. The current versus voltage characteristics are unique amongst semiconductor devices, looking like a capital letter (N). So, unlike most devices, a line drawn through this (N) provides three intersections. The middle is unstable and unusable, but the first and third provide for a simple way to store 1-bit, a (0) or a (1), using a single tunnel diode with another circuit element, such as a second tunnel diode or transistor, as the load. This project builds upon previous advances by building a multi-institutional team (Wayne State University, Tampere University of Technology, Aalto University and Picosun) spanning two countries (USA and Finland). The properties of this thin metal oxide tunneling barrier are key to the discovered operation. This project seeks a new way to deposit this layer that would permit large area deposition across flexible substrates, reaching a meter wide. Through collaborations with Finnish industry, we will increase the competitiveness and position of US industry and advance the intelligence and functionality of organic electronics, solar cells, electronic printing and atomic layer deposition technology. Participation of industry and international collaborators will broaden the culture of innovation and focus the research output towards strategic commercialization. <br/><br/>Technical: Ohio State University (OSU) proposes a 3-year bi-national (USA, Finland) project to advance printed organic electronics, particularly using organic tunnel diodes (OTD) and circuits integrated with organic field effect transistors (OFET). Their unique negative differential resistance (NDR) will reduce OFET device count, while concurrently reducing power consumption. Energy thrifty circuits will be key for autonomously powered sensor nodes for a dense network of trillions of objects for the Internet of Things (IoT). International teaming with Tampere Univ. of Technology (TUT-Finland) and Picosun (Finland), an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool manufacturer, will provide collaborative opportunities for large-area rapid roll-to-roll (R2R) technologies to prototypical scale-up of the existing fundamental studies while enhancing materials discovery and understanding. A key aim of this project is working with Wayne State University (WSU) for novel ALD precursor and oxidizer discovery and process development to explore non-stoichiometric ALD for metal oxide tunnel barriers with engineering oxygen vacancies (energy level of defects, density-of-states, etc.) that critically control OTD defect related tunneling processes and therefore device performance based on NDR. Advances by this team for the first conjugated polymer based tunnel diode circuitry using room temperature NDR enable new opportunities for low-power consumption portable circuitry (logic, memory and mixed-signal). NDR circuitry can provide (i) component count reduction (more computational power per unit area), (ii) lower power consumption (fewer devices per logic function). Tremendous benefits to society and humankind: 1) Low-cost, ultra-low power autonomous plastic electronic memory, logic and wireless systems; 2) Advanced high-K dielectrics compatible with the limited thermal budget of organics; 3) Understanding of defects and their role in tunneling transport through thin high-K dielectrics; 4) Large-area, R2R electronic printing for high volume production. Students and international exchange: A full-time graduate student will be directly supported here. REU supplements will supplement this team with 1-2 undergraduates, along with international scientific visitations."

Nematode blood pathogens are parasitic worms that enter the skin and blood of people as tiny larvae and are common in Latin America and the Caribbean. The relationship between these nematodes and virus transmission has not been well studied, but there is some evidence that nematodes may enhance virus transmission. For a mosquito to become infectious and transmit the virus, the virus must pass from the mosquito's gut (after the mosquito feeds on the blood of a person infected with the virus) through the insect's gut wall, which can serve as a barrier to the virus. However, larval nematodes can penetrate the mosquito's midgut wall, potentially enhancing virus transmission into the mosquito body. This project will test the hypothesis that larval nematodes are increasing a mosquito's ability to transmit Zika. If they have this effect, treating people for these parasitic worms could reduce disease transmission. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.<br/><br/>This project will investigate whether people infected with larval nematodes, microfilariae, enhance the transmission of arboviruses, such as the Zika virus. After feeding on an infected host, a mosquito ingests microfilariae, which penetrate the mosquito's midgut providing a pathway for viruses obtained in the blood meal to enter the body cavity and ultimately the salivary glands. These mosquitos become more susceptible to virus transmission, which can accelerate virus development leading to more infectious mosquitos. Microfilariae can penetrate the midgut of Aedes aegypti, which is the mosquito that transmits Zika. This study will quantify midgut microfilariae penetration for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus after being fed mixtures of microfilariae (Mansonella ozzardi) and Zika to determine the rate of viral infection and dissemination for the Zika virus."

For most homeowners, their house is their single largest financial asset.  Economic theory predicts that changes in house values should result in changes in consumption; if the value of your house has increased, you are richer and presumably would consider an increase in spending.  However, identifying the size of this effect is complicated.  Both house values and household consumption are also affected by a number of other factors.  For example, easy credit may increase both housing prices and consumption. The challenge is magnified because we have limited data on consumption at the level of individual households.  This project uses a 'natural experiment' approach.  The economists will look at housing prices in a residential area of Connecticut that was directly affected by an event that was not predicted.  This is an exogenous shock to housing values. Using information on spending by individual households inside and outside of the affected area, the researchers hope to identify the structural component associated with changes in house prices. Better understanding of the relationship between house prices and household expenditures will allow investors and policymakers to better judge the future effects of housing market fluctuations on the macroeconomy.<br/><br/>The goal is identification of the structural relationship between house price and household expenditures by combining a natural experiment with credit bureau data on credit card purchases.

Despite its cultural, economic, and food security importance, however, the shea tree is under threat. Slow-growing shea trees traditionally are not planted; rather, nuts are gathered from mature, essentially wild trees found in minimally-managed areas called parklands. Due to increasing land-use pressures, the number of these parkland shea trees is declining. In a broad partnership with regional organizations, this project seeks to reverse this trend by improving the value of shea through modern breeding. By turning this semi-wild, variably-yielding species into a more actively managed and deliberately planted tree crop, the long-term impact of this project will be no less than improved livelihoods (enhanced nutrition, increased income, and more robust risk mitigation) for the millions of rural women and their families across sub-Saharan Africa currently dependent on the highly valued but threatened parkland populations of shea tree.<br/><br/>With the long juvenile period of shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa) making traditional breeding approaches untenable, efficient improvement of the species requires modern breeding tools, including publicly-available foundational genomics resources and highly characterized mapping populations. This project will develop such resources, thereby enabling the long-term genome-enabled improvement of this currently undomesticated species. An assembly of the highly heterozygous (>37%) 0.8 Gb diploid genome will be accomplished using long-read (PacBio; HGAP) sequencing of cv. 'AK01,' a key parent in West African shea breeding efforts to date. Once annotated using RNA-seq data from replicated, multiple-tissue libraries (Illumina Hi-seq; MAKER-P), a comprehensive collection of mapped and functionally-classified SNPs will be developed by resequencing (Ion Proton)100 diverse V. paradoxa accessions gathered from across the species' natural distribution. By also developing a nested association mapping population, a replicated association mapping panel, and an open-source repository for all genotypic and phenotypic data, this project aims to put genomic selection of improved shea populations within the reach of regional breeding and parkland regeneration programs. By training a PhD student and holding a regional workshop, the project also invests in the capacity building necessary to bring the full potential of these genomic, informatic, and plant genetic resources to fruition. Through a broad partnership with national programs, the CGIAR system, the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC), and the Global Shea Alliance (GSA), all project outcomes are poised for immediate translation to the shea improvement sector."

Kahle, Tamal K. Dey, Facundo Memoli, Yusu Wang<br/><br/>This NSF award will support a conference on ""Topology, Geometry, and Data Analysis"" at Ohio State University in May 2016. Topology and geometry provide novel and robust methods for understanding the shape and structure of complex data sets. This meeting will gather a number of experts in algebraic topology, computational geometry, and related areas, as well as researchers in more applied scientific domains. The main aims are to exchange ideas and to consolidate synergistic activities through fostering collaborations. The organizers will encourage participation by a number of junior participants, introducing this emerging field to the next generation of researchers. Most of the funding will support travel and local expenses of conference participants.<br/><br/>Applied algebraic topology is a rapidly developing area. This meeting will focus on a few of the most promising fronts. It will bring together specialists in computational topology and geometry (mesh generation and manifold reconstruction, persistent homology and cohomology), experts in the theoretical underpinnings (algebraic and categorical views of persistent homology, stability and inference), and researchers working in more applied areas (mathematical neuroscience, molecular biology, material science). The organizers are especially interested in new collaborations across disciplines, for example in applying topological methods to detect previously unknown structure in biological datasets, so the focus of this meeting is coherent but broad.

This award is cofounded by the Global Venture Funds in the Office of International Science and Engineering. This workshop is committed to in bringing young and senior scientists together, and to discuss their current research and builds informal networks with their peers fostering collaborations and interactions between scientists from different countries and fields that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. To fulfill this scientific goal and the broader impacts, the organizers have invited a significant number of early career faculty and postdocs as well as senior scientists to speak at the meeting. The proposed travel stipends will be used to bring early career scientists from the US, and to encourage the participation of female physics and engineering faculty at the meeting. Exposing a diverse mix of scientists to this kind of intensive interactive meeting will be an excellent way to stimulate broader participation in cutting edge international projects.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This workshop is on deformable biological and bio-inspired materials, and will focus on the role of anisotropy on the structural and functional attributes of biomaterials, especially from a morphological point of view. Although material anisotropy has been demonstrated to have significant implications, on the strength and functioning of tissue engineered constructs, its role as a control parameter for designing biomaterials in general is yet to be assessed. This necessitates the need for a fundamental insight into the science of deformable materials bounded, on the one hand by structural ordering, and on the other hand by biological activity. The goal of this workshop is to bring together top class pure and applied scientists (about 25 to 55 participants) with the aim of interfacing multiple disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology and engineering) to understand the fundamentals of anisotropic deformable materials, and in tandem, develop applications based on these novel concepts. These interactions will be critical to generate an understanding of how particular materials should be designed to be ""symbiotic"" with biological entities and how to get similarity in functioning of biomaterials with their living counterparts."

Similarity search has been used to understand the mechanics of tectonic tremor, transform our understanding of the depth dependence of faulting, illuminate diffusion within aftershock seismicity, and reveal new insights into induced earthquakes. These results were achieved with modest data volumes ? from ~ 10 seismic stations spanning ~ 10 km ? yet they increased the number of detected earthquakes by a factor of 10 to 100. This geoinformatics project will develop the cyberinfrastructure required to enable high-sensitivity studies of earthquake processes through the discovery of previously undetected seismic events within massive data volumes.<br/><br/>This goal of this project is to develop a cyberinfrastructure to mine seismic waveform data. The effort will develop methods and hardware to use coherent signal processing on very large waveform databases to detect, locate and characterize events that cannot be detected by standard network operations (detection of single arrivals, association, location by optimization). <br/><br/>The methodology involves the use of a network-based approach for earthquake detection, especially weak and unusual events that in the current method of treating signals individually go unreported. The PIs will work on the large T and the large N problem, where large T is using waveform similarity of multiple events over time to detect earthquakes over long periods of time; and the large N is using waveform similarity of single events over space as recorded on a dense seismic array with up to thousands of stations.<br/><br/>The results will greatly increase knowledge of the number of seismic sources of various kinds and potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. Seismicity induced by human activities is an emerging problem that adversely affects energy options for the 21st century, including shale gas development, enhanced geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration. A more complete view of seismicity related to these activities is essential to managing the risks they pose."

Public health experts, policymakers and economists are coming to recognize the implications of wellbeing for society as a whole, as well as individuals, thanks to a growing set of results from cross-sectional, longitudinal and experimental studies, including those noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Increasingly, researchers in several fields have noted a positive correlation between language maintenance and wellbeing in endangered language communities. While the nature of the connection between language and wellbeing remains the subject of much debate, the existence of a connection is not entirely unexpected, given the range of outcomes associated with wellbeing. In addition, languages encode knowledge systems, so language loss represents not only the loss of a communicative system, but also the loss of traditional knowledge systems. Importantly, traditional knowledge systems encode cultural practices related to well-being.  Understanding the connections between language and wellbeing will potentially have implications for public health and policy and beyond, but also for language researchers, since traditional knowledge systems are among the most threatened domains of endangered language. Knowledge of esoteric domains such botanical classification and traditional medicines is forgotten well before basic vocabulary and language structure. Hence, these areas of traditional knowledge are precisely the areas which need to be prioritized by language documenters.  <br/> <br/>This project will bring together leading scholars from across the world to explore connections between language and wellbeing as part of the 2017 International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation (ICLDC). Since its inception in 2009, ICLDC has become the flagship venue driving scholarship in the documentation, maintenance and revitalization of endangered and other languages.  Participants include undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty from linguistics, anthropology, biology and other academic disciplines.  ICLDC has also included a large number of citizen scientists from historically underrepresented groups in the sciences, such as Native Americans, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, offering opportunities for broadening participation in the language sciences as one of the broader impacts of this conference.  <br/> <br/>ICLDC offers its highly diverse audience opportunities for informal science education and training that includes new methodologies and best practices in cutting edge language documentation and that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries.  In addition, this conference serves as one of the foremost venues for the dissemination of research findings in language documentation and conservation and related disciplines."

Cell-to-cell communication between hosts and pathogens plays an essential role in regulating host defense and pathogen virulence and involves transport and exchange of regulatory molecules across the cellular boundaries. Recent findings from the PI's lab of fungal sRNAs that translocate into plant host cells to suppress host immunity provided the first example of sRNAs trafficking between pathogens and their hosts. This project will use the fungal pathogen B. cinerea, which causes grey mold diseases on almost all vegetables, fruits and many flowers, and its plant hosts to understand the mechanism of cross-kingdom small RNA trafficking and regulation, and to develop an effective RNA-based practical strategy for controlling B. cinerea and other aggressive pathogens. This project will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Efforts are in place to recruit students from underrepresented minorities to work on this project.<br/><br/>Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) plays an essential role in both host immunity and pathogen virulence. The PI's lab has discovered that sRNAs from some eukaryotic pathogens regulate pathogen virulence. Some sRNAs from an aggressive fungal pathogen, Botrytis cinerea, are translocated into host plant cells and hijack the host RNAi machinery to silence important host immunity genes. Recent studies from animal systems also suggest that mobile sRNAs are capable of trafficking between mammals and their interacting organisms. However, how these mobile sRNAs are transported between the interacting organisms, and whether plant endogenous sRNAs are secreted and translocated into pathogen cells are still largely unknown. It is also not clear what these mobile sRNAs regulate in the interacting organisms. This project aims to address these questions by determining pathways and components required for sRNA trafficking between fungal cells and plant cells; identifying and functionally characterizing these sRNAs; and developing  sRNA-based effective means to control aggressive eukaryotic pathogens. The results of these studies will advance our knowledge of sRNA trafficking in the cross-kingdom RNAi between plant hosts and eukaryotic pathogens. Understanding how sRNAs communicate between organisms will facilitate utilization and manipulation of sRNAs for disease control and host immunity."

But peatlands also release methane back to the atmosphere. The degree to which peatlands act as carbon sinks and methane sources largely depends on the types of plants growing there. The far northern areas where Arctic peatlands occur are warming rapidly and so it is important to determine how sensitive their carbon storages are to changes in vegetation that are already underway. It is known that when the main peatland plants change from sphagnum mosses to sedges, as is happening in many areas, the rate of carbon storage may change a lot, but the specific response of any particular peatland is not easy to predict. Much of the unpredictability results from difficulties in telling apart the dominant plants in peatlands through history. If that was possible, then much better predictions into the future could be made. So the main objective of this project is to create a database of the chemical properties of Arctic sedges and other plants known to dominate peatlands in the past. The database will be available to the public and be set up so that it can be easily updated and added to. The project will also continue a program that brings high school teachers from the New York area to the arctic to participate in field studies associated with the project. These teachers will then develop teaching modules connected to high school science curriculums. <br/><br/>Members of the Cyperaceae (sedges) inhabit diverse environments, spanning a wide range of moisture balance, pH, and nutrient availability. However, they are notoriously difficult to identify by their fossil remains in peat cores, even to the family level, because of the paucity of identifiable plant parts that are species specific. But while the plant parts themselves are often absent, chemicals they produced are almost always present. Of the thousands of compounds produced, most have yet to be properly characterized and linked to particular species. This project will generate such a database and will also relate vegetation types, as characterized by their chemical constituents, to net carbon accumulation rate. In doing so, the first predictive models of carbon accumulation in peatlands based on vegetation change will be developed. This is an important step towards fully integrating peatlands into global climate models, which will allow a more comprehensive understanding of the feedbacks between climate change and peatland carbon accumulation."

The EIP is the length of time from when a mosquito is first exposed to the virus, to when the virus has migrated to the salivary gland and the mosquito is capable of spreading it at its next feeding. The EIP and potential for vertical transmission of Zika virus in mosquito vectors is critical to accurately modeling the spread of the virus across the continent. The team will expose the mosquitos to a range of viral concentrations at difference temperatures, and will utilize genetic tools to quantify the virus and characterize the timing of spread within the mosquito. Furthermore the research team will explore how these variables are affected by co-infection with dengue virus."

The primary considerations that motivate this research are: the reduction of carbon dioxide could potentially serve as a sustainable source of hydrocarbon-based fuels, and the process may additionally provide a sustainable chemical route to ethylene and other essential chemicals.  A novel, time-resolved, infrared spectroscopic method is developed to detect intermediates of this complex multi-step chemical conversion process.  The new insight gained from conducting the research leads to a better understanding of the molecular origins that control the catalytic activity and selectivity of copper.  A better understanding on the molecular level informs the design and development of industrially-viable catalysts for the conversion of carbon dioxide to fuel and building block chemicals.  In addition to the technical broader impacts of the project, societal benefits are realized in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced chemical research methods.  This research is under the SusChEM initiative as it uses a non-precious metal, copper, as the catalyst.<br/>   <br/>The principal goal of this research is to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the unique catalytic ability of copper to reduce carbon dioxide to methane and ethylene in an aqueous electrochemical environment. Specifically, this research aims to delineate the mechanistic origins of the high over-potentials necessary to drive the reduction and the elementary steps which control the selectivity for one hydrocarbon product over the other.  While the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide has been an active area of research for over three decades, this project develops and employs a fundamentally different technique uniquely suited to address these key aims.  Specifically, an electrochemical cell is coupled to a time-resolved infrared spectrometer.  The potential of the electrochemical cell is rapidly jumped on a sub-microsecond timescale, providing a fast electrical trigger for the electro-reduction reaction.  The transient intermediates of the triggered reaction are monitored by the time-resolved infrared spectrometer.  The approach provides new thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural information essential for guiding the design of more efficient catalysts for this reaction."

The first prototype tags will be sized for medium to large animals, such as penguins, turtles, and sharks. These data tags will record information central to understanding animal migration. In more general applications, the increased amount of data obtained by the tags will provide valuable information to scientists and policymakers to help understand the complex properties and changes in the ocean and other aquatic environments, thus aiding conservation efforts. Important areas for study include estuarine environments, where rapid profiling can record dynamic conditions, and low and high salinity areas such as choked lagoons, coastal isolated lakes, and subglacial lakes. The data will enhance our ability to understand seasonal variations, changes caused by human populations and activities, and global climate change. This project will support three undergraduate student internships (one chemical engineer and two biologists). The project will also include a lesson plan on ocean salinity measurements for a local high school with a high percentage of underrepresented groups to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, and to encourage young students to consider multidisciplinary careers in engineering and the sciences with environmental conservation in mind. <br/><br/>Sensors in the innovative tags will measure water temperature, depth, and salinity (the amount of dissolved salts), which are interrelated indicators of ecosystem health. The data produced will be geo-referenced; that is, the tag will provide a location of the collected information. These tags will differ from current commercial devices by measuring salinity as a function of the optical properties of the water (the refractive index) by detecting and recording changes in the interaction of light with the sensor (patent pending). The major advantages of the optical measurement include fast operation, wide dynamic range, and cost effectiveness for the attainable resolution. The parameters collected by the tag will provide valuable information about the marine environment that can be correlated to locations where specific animals travel to satisfy their basic food and reproduction needs, and will provide insight into habitat changes linked to declining marine populations."

The co-PI will collect qualitative data from interviews and participant observation with researchers, civil society actors, cotton extension agents, cotton farmers of different class positions, and rural women. The research will use iterative and comparative analysis to identify zones of transformation, conflict, or resistance.  The researcher will examine cultural narratives and identity claims, as well as peoples' changing interactions with ecological landscapes.

The past few decades have witnessed steady growth in studies of state-formation, particularly research on the state's increasing influence on the lives of ordinary people. This research, and much of sociology in general, has tended to neglect questions of language, in spite of language's foundational role in social life. This project addresses this gap in the literature by asking: What strategies does the state employ to accumulate symbolic power in the realm of language? This project will answer this question by focusing on the case of the Chinese transition from Classical to Modern Chinese, which occurred between the 1910s and 1930s. Previously, Classical Chinese had, much like Latin in Europe, functioned as a supranational language of scholarship and government. Nationalist movements in the latter half of the 19th century spurred the rise of national vernaculars in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, as well as in China. This project's closer examination of the Chinese case will clarify the social theory of language by looking at a state that in three decades accomplished what took place in Europe over several centuries.<br/><br/>To answer the question about how states shape language practices, this dissertation will examine Chinese government archival material located in the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China. The state-formation literature has largely been grounded in Western European cases, in which language change took place over centuries, and tends to treat non-European or postcolonial cases separately, as instances of state-led development or modernization. On the other hand, historical scholarship on China tends to look at changes in language practices as the result of various intellectual ""movements,"" which places intellectuals in an ambivalent relationship with the state. Relying on archival documents, including bureaucratic memoranda, statutes, regulations, meeting minutes, as well as official and personal correspondence, this project seeks to clarify the relationship between language-reforming intellectuals and the state, and thus clarify the state's role in influencing language practices. In so doing, this project will contribute to contemporary debates on the social implications of government policies on language and education, particularly social stratification stemming from unequal access to cultural capital."

Scholars do not yet understand whether differences in academic performance among those with Bachelor's degrees also contribute to employment inequalities. This question is an important consideration not only because achievement is stratified within the student population, but also because students differ in the extent to which they invest time and effort in their academic performance. Women, in particular, typically have higher grades and spend more time on academic activities than men, but it is unclear whether these efforts pay off at the point of hiring. Accordingly, this project addresses three key questions: Are there returns to academic performance in the labor market? If so, what are they? And, do these returns vary for men and women?  This research can help us understand persistent inequalities between women and men.<br/><br/>The research will conduct original, experimental data collected in two related studies to answer these questions. Study 1 is an online audit experiment, also known as a field experiment or correspondence study. Matched pairs of job applications will be sent to approximately 1,250 entry-level employers in five metropolitan areas in the U.S. Applicants' college GPA, gender, and major will be experimentally manipulated to establish their causal effects on several labor market outcomes, including callback rate and potential starting salary. Study 2 is an online survey experiment designed to analyze the mechanisms behind the patterns observed in Study 1. A pool of respondents who are hiring decision-makers at U.S. firms will evaluate the same resumes presented in Study 1 and provide feedback about applicants and their credentials. Taken together, these studies will help explain how and why employers evaluate academic performance for men and women, while potentially uncovering important inequalities in the transition from college to work.  This research contributes to sociological research on persistent inequalities as well as has practical implications for human resource and other managers interested in promoting diversity and workplace fairness."

The event will take place on Sunday, October 23, immediately preceding and in conjunction with the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS 2016), to be held October 24-28, in Reno, Nevada.  The ASSETS conferences are the premier forum for presenting innovative research on the design and use of both mainstream and specialized assistive technologies.  This includes the use of technology by and in support of: individuals with hearing, vision and other sensory impairments; individuals with motor impairments; individuals with memory, learning and cognitive impairments; individuals with multiple impairments; older adults; and professionals who work with these populations.  Researchers and developers from around the world, in both academia and industry, will meet at ASSETS 2016 to exchange ideas and present their latest work.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://assets16.sigaccess.org/.   A key component of building any community is through its youth.  The Doctoral Consortium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in this field, by providing them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community.  It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  The organizers will take steps to promote participation from institutions with relatively large numbers of students from under-represented groups.  To further increase diversity, the organizers will aim for equal participation of females and males in the consortium, and will not invite more than 1 or 2 students from the same educational institution; if two students from the same educational institution are selected, the organizers will ensure that at least one of them is from an underrepresented minority in STEM.<br/><br/>The ASSETS 2016 Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused meeting of an international group of selected Ph.D. candidates and a panel of distinguished research faculty (the latter yet to be named).  It will provide an opportunity for graduate students from diverse backgrounds (computing, engineering, psychology, architecture, etc.) to come together and explore their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of the PI and the panel of experts, so that they can appreciate the broader spectrum of research and development approaches to assistive technologies and universal usability, and also experience the community in which they can pursue their endeavors.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the consortium, and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Thus, the consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at assistive technologies and universal access, will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in this emerging interdisciplinary area, and will also expose these promising young researchers to a larger community.  In an effort to integrate Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, a poster session has been set aside in the technical program to allow all Doctoral Consortium participants to present their research to the full conference.  In addition, the international panel of faculty will give a presentation on job opportunities for researchers in both academia and industry; such a discussion has taken place in doctoral symposia at other conferences, and has been considered extremely valuable by the students when considering career options.  An evaluation of the consortium will be conducted and the results made available to the organizers of future such events."

Despite the gravity of this problem, few systematic attempts have been made to design and evaluate feasible, scalable ways to enhance revenue collection and public sector performance. Through four related but distinct studies, this project will fill this gap by examining the impact of incentive policies on public employee performance, as well as the roles of citizen engagement and tax collectors' ability on revenue collection. Given the critical importance of these issues and the embedded and sustained nature of the researcher-policymaker partnerships, the results will provide practical guidance on increasing tax revenues to a large audience of policymakers worldwide.<br/><br/>While there has been significant work done on the optimal design of statutory taxes (e.g., Pomeranz 2014, Kleven and Waseem 2013), there has been less focus on increasing revenue and enforcement within a given system of taxation. This project seeks to explore enforcement and compliance issues contributing to the low collection of urban property taxes and examine the effectiveness of schemes designed to address those issues. The project consists of four studies. The first is a new randomized trial that addresses tax morale and the willingness of citizens to pay taxes. This component seeks to strengthen the link between tax payment and service provision by eliciting taxpayers' service preferences and sharing this information with their local governments. Localities will be randomly assigned to either receive the information from this preference elicitation or not, and those that receive it will be randomly assigned to allocate a portion of their budgets based on taxpayer preferences or to spend as normal. Tracking revenues, allocations, service provision, and citizen beliefs will provide a clean empirical estimate of the impact of these schemes on taxpayer attitudes and actual revenues. The next two studies focus on incentivizing tax collector performance. In the second study, tax collectors were randomly assigned to compete for preferable job postings based on their performance, which was measured by the increase in recovery or the tax base. This design allows for clean testing of the impact of these non-financial incentives on revenues and collector behavior, which will be analyzed during the course of this project. The third study will evaluate the long-term impacts of a previous study, in which tax collectors were randomly assigned to receive performance pay for two years based on revenue collection, audits, and/or subjective ratings. This performance pay ended two years ago, and the current study will determine whether this past period of performance pay had a persistent effect on tax collection' information that can help design the optimal duration for and interval between such schemes. The final study will analyze the impact of individual inspectors' characteristics on revenues by using the overlap of different collectors in the same region to separate individual from regional effects."

Yet, the mechanical properties of Co films, either in face-centered-cubic (fcc) or hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) form are poorly understood. The principal investigator's recent studies show that high-density stacking faults (SFs) - atomic planes that disrupt the ordered arrangement of atoms - can be introduced into fcc and hcp Co. These SFs may drastically enhance mechanical properties leading to higher strength and ductility of Co. The aim of the project is to elucidate the effect of the density of SFs and systematically investigate the mechanical properties of Co with SFs. The investigators have existing collaborations and their expertise nicely complements each other. The collaboration provides students with the opportunity to gain complementary knowledge in experiments and simulations through mutual visits, lectures and seminars at the participating institutions. The investigators also have arrangement for graduate students to visit the Department of Energy - Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies to access advanced microscopy facilities. The knowledge derived from this project can be incorporated into curricula at both institutions. The co-investigator can leverage successful outreach programs at University of Houston to broaden participation in engineering. The principal investigator can recruit a minority graduate student through the ""Pathway to Doctoral Program"" from minority institutions. Both investigators continuously supervise undergraduate students and encourage their students to attend major conferences.   <br/><br/><br/>Technical summary:<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to investigate the deformation mechanisms in fcc and hcp Co with high-density SFs. The ultimate goal is to understand the significance of SFs in governing the mechanical properties of metals, and improving the strength and deformability of Co. The investigators combine experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to perform the following major tasks: (1) understand the nucleation of SFs and the formation of intercepted SFs in fcc Co, and tailor the density of SFs in fcc and hcp Co; 2) examine the deformation mechanisms in fcc Co, including dislocation-SF interactions, size effect and work hardening, via a combination of in situ nanoindentation and atomistic modeling; and 3) investigate the deformation mechanisms in hcp Co with high density SFs and understand nucleation mechanisms of deformation twins in hcp Co.

Furthermore, the combination of novel nanomechanical testing tools with molecular dynamics simulations fills in the knowledge gap through comprehensive interrogation of the deformation mechanisms in fcc and hcp Co with SFs at the atomistic level."

Each year, the REU program will provide ten or eleven students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students work closely with a faculty mentor  on a ten-week research project in a variety of physics subfields. The projects span the subfields of astrophysics, biophysics, complex systems, condensed matter, nuclear and particle physics.  Examples include developing new photomultipliers for dark matter searches, analyzing spectroscopic data to learn about the molecules present in distant planet-forming regions, designing new proteins with useful energy storage properties, and exploring strongly correlated materials through nuclear magnetic resonance. <br/><br/>In addition to their specific research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty, graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-related work in diverse settings -- students will visit facilities such as the McClellan Nuclear Research Center, Lick Observatory, and the Advanced Light Source. Former UC Davis REU students now working in the San Francisco Bay Area will also describe their career paths to current participants. At the end of the program, each participant gives a formal research presentation and presents a written project report that can lead to a peer reviewed publication. Taken as a whole, the REU activities teach skills useful for further scientific endeavors, give students a broad perspective on possible future paths, and help them build a network of professional contacts. The program especially targets students from small colleges with limited research opportunities and those from groups underrepresented in physics, including women and students from certain minority groups."

Inkjet depositing is a valuable technique, with potential applications that vary from wound treatment to advanced manufacturing. However, this potential is currently limited by the practical restriction of inkjet depositing to printing on flat surfaces. This research will enable new classes of technologies, products, and services. The work will be done through a university-industry partnership between researchers at The University of Texas at Dallas and experts at MicroFab Technologies, a Dallas-area organization. The team will focus on two real-world applications: 1) printing customized wound treatments directly onto wounds arising from cancer tissue removal or traumatic injury, and 2) printing labels onto manufactured parts to increase assembly efficiency. Research outcomes will be integrated into engineering education workshops at UT Dallas, as well as exhibits at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in downtown Dallas.<br/><br/>There is a lack of specific knowledge of droplet motion on curved surfaces after deposition/impact, necessitating methods to detect and alter drop placement to regulate final fluid distribution.

This project requires innovative sensing and control strategies incorporating feedforward, feedback and adaptive control to address uncertainty in the surface measurement and models of the interactions between liquid and surface. Specifically, tools of information theory, nonlinear estimation, optimization, Lyapunov-based stability theory and geometric control will be used to establish a formal approach to conduct such printing with robot manipulators, along with understanding of liquid properties and surface chemistry."

Means of identifying such ?hot spots? of sensitivity to change would allow us to target remediation and other management measures where they will do the most good. This project will test and explore the ecologic and management implications of a novel hypothesis termed human-amplified natural change (HANC), which states that the areas of the landscape that are most susceptible to human, climatic, and other external changes are those undergoing the highest natural rates of change.<br/><br/>The research team will develop a theoretical framework for vulnerability assessment and will test the HANC hypothesis through intensive study of the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a 44,000 km2 agriculturally-dominated watershed in the upper Midwest. The MRB encompasses an extremely broad spectrum of natural and human-induced rates of change and sensitivity to land-use practices. Of particular interest is the complex nonlinear coupling between land use and river network processes, which has already resulted in severely impaired waters for sediment and nutrients. What will be the future condition of the waters and ecosystem services in the MRB under changing human actions and climatic conditions? Of the many potential land and water management options, which are most likely to produce a sustainable, resilient, and thriving coupled economic-environmental system?  To answer such questions, this study seeks to:<br/><br/>(1) determine the extent to which current high rates of sediment production are concentrated in areas that were undergoing high rates of natural change before the external changes were imposed; <br/>(2) study how thresholds and localized features in the system amplify and accelerate change and how such nonlinear effects can be parameterized in an integrated predictive modeling framework; <br/>(3) investigate the extent to which the human-amplified natural changes (HANC) in the geomorphic system contribute to observed ecological changes in the MRB; and <br/>(4) develop means to include HANC-based reasoning in decision analysis frameworks, including a suite of methods to identify sensitive regions, along with spatially targeted monitoring activities.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Strong relationships previously developed with State regulatory agencies will ensure that the results from this project directly influence future land and water policy and management decisions.  The research team will disseminate new knowledge directly to the public in close collaboration with State agencies via stakeholder meetings, widely attended regional meetings and informational reports. Further, they will develop a HANC-based analytical toolbox for evaluating areas prone to rapid change in the landscape, beginning with Midwestern agricultural landscapes. New knowledge generated from this work will be used to inform Science Museum exhibits related to the Anthropocene, develop innovative K-12 curricula in environmental science and engineering, and disseminate NSF?s Earth Science and Climate Literacy Principles via teacher training.

The Maritime Archaic peoples (ca. 6,000 B.C.-1,000 B.C.) were the first to colonize the Eastern Subarctic and Arctic of North America. They created a way of life that allowed them to successfully occupy the entire coast and near interior of Newfoundland and Labrador for thousands of years, and maintain relationships with contemporaneous cultures that stretched throughout much of northeastern North America. However, we still know very little about their initial settlement of the region, their early social organization, and the ways these processes were affected by ecological factors. The aim of this research is to examine the initial settlement of Newfoundland within the larger context of the peopling of northeastern North America and the roles that historical processes, both cultural and environmental, played in that broader framework. This will include new archaeological excavations at early Maritime Archaic sites in Newfoundland, as well as investigation and analysis of existing Maritime Archaic artifact collections from throughout the region. It will also examine ecological data, such as plant and animal remains, to assess the wider role of environmental change in the initial occupation of the eastern Subarctic and how early cultural adaptations developed within northern coastal and island ecosystems. <br/><br/>This project is an international collaboration of professional archaeologists, graduate students, and undergraduates. The training and education of undergraduate students is a critical component of this project. Moreover, project members will continue to collaborate with local communities to develop economic and preservation initiatives related to the archaeological sites and cultural heritage associated with this research and to create educational opportunities for students and community members in the region. <br/><br/>This research will have extensive implications for our understanding of how and when people first settled the easternmost region of North America, and northern coasts and islands more generally. The earliest human migration onto any landscape is a complex, interactive, and dynamic historical process. In North America, the colonization process is often generalized within an evolutionary perspective that envisions humans simply reacting to ecological opportunities offered by newly available landscapes and resources at the end of the last Ice Age. It is also often framed as solely a Paleoindian process that did not extend far into the Holocene, despite the fact that large portions of northern North America were not colonized until the Middle Holocene. New archaeological fieldwork and collections analysis concerning the Archaic expansion onto and around the island of Newfoundland will inform larger models of human colonization within the region, as well as in other Arctic and Subarctic coastal zones. This includes the initial peopling of North America on the other side of the continent and the role that northern coasts and islands played in that process. It will also help us better understand the interaction between Archaic people and their environment and the adaptation strategies they employed in unknown coastal and island landscapes, as well as the relative impact they had on those environments. <br/><br/>To address these issues the research team will survey and date extant collections to fine-tune the chronological resolution of the initial colonization processes of Newfoundland. They will also conduct new excavations at the Stock Cove and Stock Cove West sites in eastern Newfoundland where Maritime Archaic deposits have been found that appear to stratigraphically correlate to their earliest occupations of the region and that have the first evidence of architecture by Archaic peoples on the island. This will be assessed with a suite of new dates and analyses of material remains recovered from those excavations. Additionally, new geophysical surveys employing ground penetrating radar and magnetometry will be conducted to locate new Archaic deposits to help focus the excavations and noninvasively assess other archaeological deposits that could address the earliest settlement of Newfoundland. Finally, ecological data (e.g. insects, faunal remains, macrobotanicals) will be collected and analyzed to help reconstruct environmental patterns that may have impacted and influenced the peopling and settlement process by the Maritime Archaic. <br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts that include: 1) the first excavation and analysis of a Maritime Archaic structure on the island of Newfoundland; 2) the contribution of important data to our understanding of Archaic social organization and settlement in the eastern Subarctic/Arctic; 3) obtaining key environmental data that will assist with the assessment of environmental change throughout the Holocene and may inform the development of modern policies regarding the mitigation of environmental change and economic impacts (e.g., sea mammal hunting, fishing quotas, wildlife conservation, sea ice extent, coastal erosion); 4) the training of undergraduate students in archaeological field and laboratory methods; 5) international dissemination of our results to both academic and public audiences, and; 6) increased interaction with local communities, regional museums, and other interested parties within Newfoundland and Labrador concerning their heritage and cultural resources, including public lectures and the development of educational tools (e.g., social media, historical markers, pamphlets, booklets) for those communities."

Although many near-optimal compression methods exist for classical text, image and video data, they tend to perform poorly on data which naturally appears in fragmented or ordered form. This is especially the case for so called ordinal data, arising in crowd-voting, recommender systems, and genome rearrangement studies. There, information is represented with respect to a ?relative,? rather than ?absolute? scale, and the particular constraints of the ordering cannot be properly captured via simple dictionary constructions. This project seeks to improve the operational performance of a number of data management, cloud computing and communication systems by developing theoretical, algorithmic and software solutions for ordinal data compaction.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to develop the first general and comprehensive theoretical framework for ordinal compression. In particular, the investigators propose to investigate new distortion measures for ordinal data and rate-distortion functions for lossy ordinal compression; rank aggregation and learning methods for probabilistic ordinal models, used for ordinal clustering and quantization; and smooth compression and compressive computing in the ordinal domain. The proposed analytical framework will also allow for addressing algorithmic challenges arising in the context of compressing complete, partial and weak rankings. The accompanying software solutions are expected to find broad applications in areas as diverse as theoretical computer science (sorting, searching and selection), machine learning (clustering and learning to rank), and gene prioritization and phylogeny (reconstruction of lists of influential genes and ancestral genomes, respectively)."

However, mechanical gearboxes are creating reliability concerns and the maintenance of the gearbox can significantly add to the levelized cost of energy. Alternative approaches such as using a direct-drive generator become impractical at higher power levels due to their inherently low torque-per-volume capability. This research will investigate the theoretical and practical performance capabilities of using magnetically geared generation devices. A magnetic gearbox offers a number of advantages over traditional mechanical gearboxes in that a magnetic gearbox creates speed change without any physical contact, it does not require gear lubrication and has an inherent overload torque limiting capability. By coupling a magnetic gearbox to a generator the reliability of the generator system can be significantly improved and the volumetric size could potentially be comparable to its mechanically geared equivalent. By improving reliability a magnetically geared generator could reduce the levelized cost of wind and ocean power conversion. This could increase the utilization of renewable energy resources and consequently help reduce the emission of airborne pollutants associated with the combustion of fossil fuels.  <br/><br/>The primary goals of this research are to (1) develop modeling tools to understand the scaling and cost/performance trade-offs of axial magnetic gears and radial magnetic gear topologies. (2) Construct and test a stator driven continuously variable magnetic gear and an axially driven direct-drive magnetically geared generator. (3) Experimentally assess the efficiency of the proposed magnetic gear devices over a wide speed and torque range.  The practical performance trade-offs between axial and radial flux-focusing magnetic gear designs when using ferrite and rare-earth magnets will be determined in the context of cost. The power flow, efficiency and power factor characteristics will be characterized with respect to existing technology. This research will lead to a greater understanding of the energy conversion process when using magnetic gears, continuously variable magnetic gears and magnetically geared direct-drive electrical machines.  The techniques required to achieve very high mass and volumetric torque densities when using flux focusing magnetic gear topologies will be carefully defined. The power flow and control equations for the integration of a continuously variable magnetic gear into the grid will be derived. Both undergraduate and graduate students will assist with this research. Underrepresented students will be actively involved in this research. Outreach activities and yearly summer research experiences for local high-school students will take place. The research results will be disseminated in leading journals, conferences, and workshops in order to benefit the scientific and industrial community."

Among the enigmas that still pertain to the study of this early American metropolis are (1) its tempo and processes of urbanization; (2) the principal factors that fueled its growing population; (3) its political organization; and (4) what architectural complexes served as seats of governance and administration.  These issues are critical for improving current understanding of the deep history of the Americas and the human creation of the earliest cities and states across the globe.

The research involves close international collaboration between researchers from the US, Mexico, and Japan.  This multifaceted, interdisciplinary project will examine the economic, political, and ritual activities that sustained the city through its largest, unexcavated administrative complex.  The international team will conduct intensive excavation, geophysical prospection, floor-chemistry analyses, and chronological assessment through a combination of ceramic, C14, and archaeomagnetic analyses. Primary objectives are to define these structures as palatial-administrative complexes, record activity areas associated with their public and private functions, and identify who resided in these complexes and what role they played in governing Teotihuacan."

But our visual world is extraordinarily complex which makes it difficult for computer vision to understand photos and for computer graphics to synthesize visual content. However, the emergence of Internet-scale photo collections in recent years enables new research directions. We use scene-based representations to leverage Internet-scale data. Scenes (places or environments) are the context in which all other visual phenomena exist and it seems possible to brute-force the space of scenes -- with millions of scenes, we find qualitatively similar scenes and create massively data-driven algorithms with capabilities that are complementary to typical bottom-up graphics and vision pipelines. The underlying principle of this study is that joint investigations of scene representations and large image databases will advance the state-of-the-art in graphics and vision. <br/><br/>First, we are investigating detail synthesis tasks which alleviate camera shake, motion blur, defocus, atmospheric scattering, or low resolution. Scene representations are robust enough to find matching scenes in Internet-scale photo collections even in the presence of dramatic blurring. These matching scenes provide a context-specific statistical model which can be used to insert convincing texture and object detail. Second, we are studying attribute-based representations of scenes. We use crowdsourcing to discover attributes and build large databases for the community. Attributes are a powerful intermediate representation for the next generation of big data imaging research which can have broad societal impact through applications such as robotics, security, assistance to vision-impaired, and vehicle safety. The investigators also are developing a new introductory course for Brown students to explore big data computing across scientific disciplines and are creating an online community for visual computing education to benefit students interested in photography and programming."

This research aims to attack these challenges by investigating: (i) novel first-order methods for deterministic CP that converge faster, require little structural information and do not rely on line search, based on level methods; (ii) stochastic first-order methods that handle data uncertainty in an optimal manner, based on stochastic approximation; (iii) novel randomization schemes for solving certain challenging deterministic CP problems beyond the capability of first-order methods; and (iv) stochastic first- and zeroth-order methods for general, not necessarily convex, stochastic programs. The research focuses on two fundamental issues across these topics: (i) the study of complexity which provides guarantees on algorithmic performance; and (ii) the exploitation of structures that leads to the design of algorithms with stronger complexity and superior practical performance.<br/><br/>If successful, a set of new algorithmic schemes will advance the state-of-the-art in nonlinear and stochastic optimization, bringing many practically relevant data analysis problems within the range of tractability. Example applications include algorithms for faster and more accurate medical image reconstruction and classification, which will be beneficial to healthcare.  In addition, in seismology, effective stochastic programming methods will help to build predictive models by measuring thousands of earthquakes detected at seismic stations.

Specifically, it addresses the extent to which the combined effects of ocean acidification, global warming and expanding hypoxia may affect energetics of squids. Squids provide a critical link in oceanic food chains, feeding on the massive zooplankton populations and serving as prey to fish and mammalian predators.  Their growth rates and maximum sizes are plastic, reflecting the changing ecosystem.  As such, they respond quickly to environmental conditions and serve as real time indicators of ecosystem health.  Oceanic squids are the only non-calcifying organisms whose sensitivity to ocean acidification was specifically predicted based on highly pH-sensitive oxygen binding by hemocyanin, the blood pigment of squids.  Only a single study has tested this prediction, finding that elevated CO2 constrains metabolism and activity levels in the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas.  The proposed analysis will integrate across levels of performance, from cell, to systemic, to whole-animal function, comparing squid species with variable blood-oxygen binding properties and CO2 exposure histories. It will addresses the combined effects of declining environmental oxygen, increasing oxygen demand due to warming, and reduced oxygen transport due to high CO2 on the function of these ""high-performance"" invertebrates.   These squids are ecologically and commercially important and are believed to be the most CO2-sensitive non-calcifying taxa.  The proposed research effort will be complemented by an extensive education and outreach effort in collaboration with the Ocean Exploration Trust and aboard the E/V Nautilus in the Caribbean in summer 2013 and 2014.  E/V Nautilus operates under a new paradigm of ""telepresence-enabled"" expeditions. Satellite and high-bandwidth Internet2 technology transmits data, including remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video feeds, to shore in real time, supporting the participation of science teams around the world and reaching a growing public and student population. Moreover, the Nautilus program is teamed up with the JASON Project that brings marine science to K-12 classrooms via curriculum development. The investigators on this project will contribute time and expertise in ocean acidification to the development of a new curriculum on Climate and Oceanography and develop a webcast for the JASON Live interactive series that will be broadcast from sea with Nautilus."

Despite the atmosphere?s fundamental role in their dispersal, the abundance, diversity and flux of microorganisms in the atmosphere remain largely unknown. The potential of ice-nucleating microorganisms to significantly impact meteorology and promote microbial dispersal during precipitation events motivates this research.  The RAINS project will sample rain, snow and air samples at ground level, and in the lower atmosphere using remote-controlled aircraft.  The project will: (1) characterize microbial taxonomic diversity, including in precipitation that occurred between 1794 AD and present, and which is preserved in glacial ice; (2) determine the genetic diversity of microbial assemblages and of individual ice nucleating bacteria and (3) examine the functional diversity with respect to the role of precipitation and biological ice nucleation on patterns of microbial distribution.  The work will also determine which microbes carried to the Earth?s surface via precipitation present possible inoculum sources for diseases that impact humans, domestic animals, and plants. <br/><br/>The RAINS project will increase understanding of biodiversity in the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere, where important meteorological phenomena such as precipitation occur.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommended developing a better understanding of the effect of aerosols and atmospheric ice formation in order to improve climate models and forecast the impact of rising global temperature. The proposed study will increase knowledge on the nature of the most active ice nucleators in the atmosphere. Microbial ice nucleation may also allow microorganisms and certain plant pathogens to efficiently cycle between the atmosphere and surface habitats, and RAINS will contribute to ongoing efforts to assess the movement of ice nucleating microorganisms across geographical scales. Outreach efforts will take these advances into high school and college classrooms in the form of hands-on research experiences for students at both levels and will serve as the basis for high school educators to develop unique classroom activities. In addition, an international network of scientists collecting field data on the relationship between biological ice nucleator abundance, cropping patterns and precipitation in dry land regions will be established. RAINS will sponsor an international conference that brings together 10 young career scientists in the network to highlight the advances of these investigations and identify the outstanding scientific questions."

Grassian<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>The challenges in understanding the environmental health and safety of nanomaterials (NanoEHS)are many but several fundamental issues in particular remain critical from a scientific perspective.<br/><br/>In fact, it has become apparent that progress will be limited without studies to address these issues.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>This EAGER proposal will address several critical needs in a concentrated program with specific objectives, hypotheses and goals. These critical areas include:<br/><br/>1. The nature of the surface of nanomaterials in biological media<br/><br/>2. The role of the core in surface functionalized nanoparticles<br/><br/>3. The unique behavior imparted to very small nanoparticles that is not just due to physical size but instead due to quantum and other intrinsic size dependent electronic effects.<br/><br/>A series of targeted experiments are proposed to address these needs. These experiments are feasible and will provide the necessary results to define a framework to address the issues discussed in this proposal. In these experiments, nanoparticles will be covered using different surface functionalities including proteins. We will conduct these studies in different media relevant to understanding the toxicity of these particles, i.e. several simulated biological media of different pH to reflect both stomach and lung fluids. Furthermore, we can quantify the amount of dissolution and ROS production in each of these and as a function of particle<br/>size, within a size range where quantum confinement is important and outside of that size range where bulk properties of electronic state structure, e.g. the band gap, are relevant.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>There are several broader impacts and translational aspects of the proposed research. First, the proposed studies are designed to gain better insight into the environmental and health impacts of nanomaterials. These studies will contribute to the growing database on the potential environmental and health implications of nanoscience and nanotechnology. This society relevant research is designed to address potential environmental problems for the nanotechnology industry. Therefore overall it has the potential to provide for the greater good of the public and consumers. The proposed activities provide an opportunity to train students in a highly interdisciplinary research area that involves environmental science and engineering, chemistry, nanoscience, colloid and surface chemistry. The PI has a track record of successfully mentoring students at all levels from high school to postdoctoral associates and visiting research scientists and will continue this effort to mentor the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Many of the students are from underrepresented groups in science and engineering including a large percentage of women (more than 60%) and minorities including students on free and reduced lunch programs and typically more diverse student populations. Funds from this NSF<br/>grant will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students to better engage these elementary students as well as the public in science and engineering."

Understanding how the complex suites of traits associated with domestication are assembled over time is a central but empirically challenging question in evolutionary biology and a topic of critical importance to agriculture, conservation, and human health. Adaptations frequently involve the coordinated change of multiple morphological, physiological, or behavioral characters, and this pattern is especially true with respect to the transformation of wild plants into crops. Domesticated approximately 5000 years ago by Native Americans, this important staple crop has a rich archaeological record and extensive genomic resources. Using cutting-edge DNA sequencing methods, a dataset reflecting the time series covering the domestication period from ancient through contemporary DNA will be developed. The research can provide new perspectives on agriculture and trade by early Native American cultures. Trainees gain international experience at the Centre for GeoGenetics in Copenhagen. A high school genomics curriculum will be developed through a summer internship program at the National Museum of Natural History that directly engages high school students in scientific discovery through initial sequencing of a new plant genome.<br/><br/>Genome-wide studies of ancient DNA have been made possible by recent technological advances and provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the historical genetic sequence of multi-trait adaptation. By following the timing and order with which beneficial genetic changes, and by inference changes in domestication traits, accumulate, the DNA dataset obtained will address a core debate over how fast domestication proceeded and test key predictions from evolutionary theory. Several hundred candidate domestication genes identified through genomic diversity and gene expression studies will be followed over an archaeological time series covering the domestication period.  Using cutting-edge solution-based sequence capture methods to vastly enrich recovery of specific sequences, several hundred of these genes will be genotyped over a time series using sunflower archaeological remains covering the domestication period. By combining this genotypic information with knowledge of gene function, the project will determine which traits evolved earlier during domestication than others and whether those traits share common features. Through integrating the ancient DNA data with existing data on effect sizes, the project will test whether variants associated with large differences in phenotype predominantly appear early or late in the adaptation process. Sunflower is an important crop today, is divergent from its wild relative in many traits, and this genetic study provides a unique opportunity to investigate how and under what conditions different evolutionary forces and genetic phenomena influence the timing and order of beneficial substitutions affecting an integrated set of traits"

Additionally, regions of the Southern Ocean are warming faster than any other locations on the planet. Ocean acidification and warming may act synergistically to impair the performance of different organisms by simultaneously increasing metabolic needs and reducing oxygen transport. However, no studies have measured krill acid-base regulation, metabolism, growth, or reproduction in the context of ocean acidification or synergistic ?greenhouse? conditions of elevated CO2 and temperature. In the present project, the investigators will conduct both short and prolonged exposure experiments at Palmer Station, Antarctica to determine the responses of Euphausia superba to elevated CO2 and temperature. The investigators will test hypotheses related to acid-base compensation and acclimation of various life stages of krill to elevated CO2 and temperature. Furthermore, they will determine these impacts on feeding, respiration, metabolism, growth, and reproduction.<br/><br/>The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a key species in Antarctic food webs as they are a primary food source for many of the top predators in the Southern Ocean including baleen whales, seals, penguins, and other sea birds. This project will determine the responses of Antarctic krill exposed to elevated CO2 and temperature and whether or not krill have the capacity to fully compensate under future ocean conditions. The proposed field effort will be complemented by an extensive broader impact effort focused on bringing marine science to both rural and urban high school students in the Midwest (Kansas). The core educational objectives of this proposal are to 1) instruct students about potential careers in marine science, 2) engage students and promote their interest in the scientific process, critical thinking, and applications of science, mathematics, and technology, and 3) and increase student and teacher awareness and understanding of the oceans and global climate change, with special focus on the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Finally, this project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the production, analysis, presentation and publication of datasets.<br/><br/>"

Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the University of North Texas (UNT) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with CSM as the lead institution. <br/><br/>The proposed Center aims to establish the industrial support, operational mechanisms, and a prospective research portfolio for a viable research Center that will conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced non-ferrous structural alloys. The PIs are proposing the following topical areas: high performance alloys (nickel base super alloys and titanium base alloys), lightweight alloys including aluminum, magnesium (and their composites), and advanced alloys and processes. The PIs will insure that students have the opportunity to work on state-of-the-art projects and to be mentored by both experimental and modeling experts. The management of these focus areas is being modeled after the highly successful Advanced Steel Products and Processing Center at CSM, namely, by having companies designate what portion of their membership fees they wish to have distributed into the three specific focus areas. <br/><br/>The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing advanced non-ferrous alloys that could reduce energy consumption and pollution in the manufacturing of these alloys. The research would also improve the competitiveness of US manufacturers. Given that the focus of the proposed center will be on the physical metallurgy of structural non-ferrous alloys, the associated programs of study at the two institutions will be reexamined and potentially modified in order to insure that the undergraduate and graduate curricula are consistent with this focus. In other words, both institutions will work to insure that the undergraduate and graduate students receive proper education and training in order for them to be well grounded in fundamental principles of physical metallurgy. As a center interacting with industry, the PIs intend to reach out to local communities to bring their attention to the issues facing this particular industry sector and how the institutions can assist these industries as they compete in these global markets. The center will also insure that diversity is one of the criteria in the selection of both undergraduate and graduate students who are considered for the industry relevant projects."

We will use geospatial integration and interdisciplinary data aggregation to document biophysical and socioeconomic changes occurring in the Arctic and to develop scenarios exploring how these complex patterns of change are likely to play out over the coming decades. This assessment will include all four ArcSEES themes (Natural and Living Environment; Built Environment; Natural Resource Development; and Governance) and provide a point of departure for the use of institutional diagnostics to examine effective strategies for addressing  current issues of Arctic governance.  To lend substance to the analysis, we will direct attention to three ""hot spots"": Bering Strait and the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (United States, Canadian and Russian interests), the Barents Sea (Norwegian and Russian interests), and West Greenland (Greenlandic, Danish, and Canadian interests). In the process, we will engage people associated with bodies like the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, whose remit extends into the Arctic Ocean.  To enhance cost-effectiveness, the project will collaborate with the SEARCH (Study of Environmental Change: www.arcus.org/search) and ACCESS  (Arctic Climate Change, Economy and Society: www.access-eu.org) projects that are supported extensively within the United States and Europe, respectively.

Many of these decisions involve yes/no decisions, as well as decisions regarding appropriate levels of various factors. For many such problems, stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) provides a powerful modeling framework. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art SMIP algorithms cannot solve realistic-sized problems that arise in real-world contexts. This award supports fundamental research aimed at investigating novel approaches that can form a framework for a general-purpose multistage SMIP solver.  The broader impacts of this work will be felt in multiple domains. Should this approach prove successful, a much richer set of models can be solved in a variety of applications arising in healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and so on. The educational impacts will be felt by graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this research, which is known as scenario-tree decomposition, a novel method will be developed for decomposing the scenario tree of a multistage SMIP, rather than its extensive form. One major advantage of such approach is that it will not require any particular structure. Based on preliminary results and prior work on establishing bounds for two-stage SMIPs, it will be shown that cuts of the scenario tree can generate lower and upper bounds on a multistage SMIP. Moreover, it is hypothesized that a hierarchy among such bounds can be established. These bounds will be incorporated into a global branch-and-bound framework. Furthermore, this approach may be generalized beyond the standard stochastic programming paradigm. For example, it may be amenable to certain classes of nonlinear SMIPs. This method is highly amenable to high-performance computing, and will provide users with an explicit tradeoff between the quality of the bounds and the requisite computational effort."

Small-scale fisheries, in particular, are incredibly important; they employ more than 90 percent of the world's approximately 35 million capture fishermen worldwide, and contribute over half of the world's marine and inland fish catch, nearly all of which is used for direct human consumption. Small-scale fisheries shape coastal cultures, economies, and ecosystems. Yet knowledge of small-scale fisheries is notoriously poor, in part because they often are marginalized within their own communities and nations. With the increasing emphasis on reconciling food security and other development aims with environmental conservation, integrated understanding of small-scale fisheries is more critical than ever. This research project will develop fundamental knowledge of human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, and help inform the development and evaluation of innovative small-scale fisheries management strategies.  Specifically, this research will examine how environmental and economic variability and institutional diversity shape the resilience and adaptive capacity of the coupled natural and human systems associated with the small-scale fisheries.<br/><br/>This work will focus on the reciprocal interactions between the ecosystems and institutions associated with small-scale fisheries in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur (BCS). BCS is an ideal model system in which to investigate these human-ecosystem dynamics, given its variability of institutional, economic, and ecological contexts. For most fishermen in BCS, access to necessary capital inputs (boats, gear, etc.) is achieved either through membership in a fishing-cooperative or via a relationship with a patron. Both empirical evidence and theory suggest that fisheries dominated by cooperatives may contribute to improved ecosystem and human wellbeing outcomes, relative to those dominated by patron-client relationships. But the mechanisms underlying these differences and how they may contribute to resilience of human and natural systems to environmental and economic variability are not well understood, nor have they been well tested empirically. This work will address these gaps by integrating field and synthetic investigations at the scale of individual fishing communities throughout BCS. This work will generate new social and ecological data including information on fish abundances and distributions, indicators of ecological resilience and ecosystem health, information on fishermen activities and community characteristics, indicators of institutional resilience, and indicators of individual and community well-being. The project will also create targeted dynamic models of key human-environment interactions that will address core issues in coupled human-natural system science, ecology, economics, and common-pools resources studies."

Dark Silicon is the result of an increase in power density that will make it necessary to leave sections of a microchip powered off. The consequences of Dark Silicon could be widespread, limiting the increasing benefits all aspects of society---from medicine, commerce to entertainment----have reaped from advances in computing. One solution is specialization. With the advent of high-level synthesis tools capable of generating circuits from high-level programming languages such as C, it is now possible to realize specialized accelerators for any application with 10-100x the efficiency of general purpose microprocessors. The computing industry needs new architecture paradigms to organize thousands of these accelerators. This project envisions the computing platform of the future as comprised of domain specific tiles, each with 10-100 specialized accelerators. The research team will advance this vision with innovations in two aspects. First, by inventing a new memory-interconnect subsystem capable of keeping these specialized cores fed with data. Second, canonical tiles will be invented for different application domains that can be studied by the wider research community.<br/> <br/>The team will study memory-interconnect systems for tiles in a manner that recognizes the unique features of many-accelerator architectures: intermittent usage of accelerators, bursts of communication, and the need to share memory between specialized cores. While designing tiles of many-accelerators, the team will develop a new description language that describes the computation and communication capabilities of a tile and matches them with a graph representation of the workload. To provide broader impact, the tools, canonical designs, and models developed by this project will be made available to the wider research community to enable the study and eventual commercialization of specialized architectures. As increasing the technological literacy of the general public is essential to cultivating responsible behavior, the integrated educational plan focuses on all age groups: it reaches K-12 students through workshops and presentations; undergraduate and graduate students through research opportunities and course offerings; and the greater Philadelphia community."

It is a serpentinization site where liquids emerge from the Earth at very high pH, very low redox potential, with almost no organics to eat, and virtually no oxygen or other things to respire: one of the most challenging environments on Earth.<br/><br/>Previous studies of two geochemically-different highly-alkaline groundwater sources revealed genomically and phylogentically unusual organisms and microbial isolates having highly-adapted physiological and genomic features to the serpentinizing environments. Here the PIs will expand their previous studies, focusing on questions related to the geochemical and microbial metabolic interactions occurring at this site: e.g., 1) how do each of the major microbial groups/players cope with the stringent geochemistry of The Cedars, 2) how do these microbes interact with one another to sustain the taxonomically stable communities of The Cedars serpentinizing environments, and, 3) how do the microbial activities potentially contribute to the occurring geochemical transformations? To answer these questions the PIs will test a number of conceptual, strategic and metabolic hypotheses, using several approaches, including: 1) a combination of advanced microscopic observations to visualize the localization of each organism, 2) stable-isotope probing to identify organisms that utilize a given carbon substrate, 3) stimulus-induced metatranscriptomics to illustrate the gene responses to the specific geochemical compounds (conditions), 4) metaproteomics to obtain the in situ protein profiles, and 5) detailed metabolic capabilities of isolated strains that are abundantly observed in terrestrial serpentinizing sites on Earth. Successful integration of results from these five strategies is expected to produce a functional interaction-model between geochemical factors and microbial metabolic activities in a relatively simple microbial community, functioning under extreme environmental conditions."

They appear in industrial applications in the production of food products, cosmetics, and advanced materials; and they occur naturally as biological fluids like mucus, blood, and biofilms. Complex fluids are known to exhibit exotic properties, sometimes acting like solids, while at other times flowing freely like liquids. These are macroscale observations, but recent advances in particle tracking techniques have shed light on fascinating dynamics that occur at the microscale as well. Accurately characterizing and understanding the behavior of foreign particles in complex fluids is vital for certain applications.  For example, learning why some particles penetrate biological fluids, while others do not, can be critical for the development of successful drug delivery techniques. Furthermore, it has been shown that the statistics of immersed particle paths can carry the signature of important large scale material properties, making it possible to study expensive complex fluids with microliter sized samples. <br/><br/>While there has been success in describing the motion of individual particles in complex fluids, developing models for interacting particle populations has proven frustrating for theoreticians. It is remarkable, for example, that there is no mathematical model for particles that individually behave according to fractional Brownian motion, but when close together, interact with each other through forces mediated by the laws of a fluid environment. This collaborative project addresses stochastic, numerical, and experimental issues arising in the study of diffusion of foreign particles in complex fluids. Specifically, we will consider two fluid models that amplify the fundamental relationships between mechanical properties of the fluids and particles paths. The models are (1) a linear viscoelastic fluid and (2) a motile suspension in a viscous fluid. In addition to developing the mathematical tools to efficiently and accurately simulate these models, we will use these simulations to address fundamental theoretical challenges that confront engineers who use particle tracking techniques."

First, to develop a type systems-based approach named differential typing, that enables reasoning about the properties of source code before and after a change has been made, and reveals the semantics of source code changes at development time.  Second, to construct a framework for declarative hypothesis testing that automates and simplifies the process of conducting empirical studies in software evolution, and software engineering in general.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary foundation of this work will catalyze interaction between two primary communities, programming languages and software engineering.

The project will transform the way researchers conduct empirical software evolution studies by shifting the focus from how hypotheses are tested to what the right hypotheses are.  The contributions will be made publicly available, which will benefit not only the research community, but also the software development community.

This project uses powerful new information and analytical tools to understand and improve how science is used across disparate federal policymaking arenas.  Central to the project is the development of the first large-scale, publicly available database that connects specific policies to specific scientific sources, allowing comparisons across time, policymaking domains, and scientific disciplines.  This database better illuminates the basis of regulatory impact assessments, reveals how science is presented to policymakers, and provides scientific researchers as well as their funders with concrete evidence of real-world policy impact. This project focuses on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs), which US federal regulatory agencies are obligated to produce to assess anticipated costs and benefits of major regulations, to: 1) describe the patterns of scientific research use in regulatory decisions; 2) identify characteristics of scientific research that make it more or less useful to policymakers; and 3) utilize specific instances of research-to-policy connections to reverse engineer science-policy networks, and understand when and how regulatory policymakers make use of scientific research.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>This project substantially advances knowledge regarding the relationships between scientific research and policymaking. The breadth and specificity in the database constructed with this research provides insights regarding many important overarching questions, such as: Do regulators draw upon scientific research more heavily when faced with particularly high profile policy decisions? Does legislative oversight influence the use of scientific research by regulators? What roles do advocacy and interest groups play in shaping the use of scientific research in regulatory policymaking? Do major research funders facilitate the production of science that is relevant to policymaking problems? The project offers substantial new contributions to understanding research use in public policymaking. Overall, the results of this project provide a comprehensive assessment of the role that important actors in the political, policy, and scientific spheres play in facilitating connections between scientific research and rulemaking.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Federal regulators establish the specific regulations intended to enhance human and ecosystem health, economic competitiveness, government functions, and other regulatory domains. The best available science is an important component of effective rulemaking. The public-use, online database produced by this project can be used by policymakers to improve their use of science, research funding agencies to understand which research is most used by policymakers and where important gaps exist, and organizations and members of the general public interested in identifying the quality and quantity of evidence--scientific and otherwise--used in the policymaking process.  The database is also openly available to scholars studying the relationship between scientific research and public policymaking. The project helps scientists as well as regulatory agencies identify areas where better research or communication can improve policymaking. Lastly, the project is poised to directly benefit regulatory policymakers in two ways. First, accessing the best possible science provides legitimacy for regulatory policymaking.  Second, the project includes substantial interactions with regulatory agency officials to better understand their methodologies for identifying appropriate science and to enhance their application of science to policymaking."

State-of-the-art laboratory and computer simulation techniques will be engaged to explore the uncharted design space of bimetallic nanostructures for such applications and implement reductions in cost through partial replacement of precious metals such as platinum by cheaper alternatives. The team of three PIs will synthesize new nanocatalysts using biomimetic approaches, image the positions of all atoms in 3D resolution using the world's most powerful electron microscope, and carry out performance tests in fuel cells in a close feedback loop with predictions by multi-scale modeling and simulation. Fundamental understanding of synthesis controls, atomic-scale order, and associated reactivity of the nanoalloys will lead to rational design rules to optimize catalyst performance and enable targeted improvements of promising materials. The development and validation of predictive multi-scale simulation tools will also benefit the broader computational user community. New fundamental insight into alloy synthesis and reactivity controls has further potential benefits to improve catalysts for commodity chemicals, magnetic information storage, batteries, sensors, and nanoelectronic devices. Undergraduate students, high school students, and teachers will be engaged in summer research activities at UCLA and in annual Engineering Career Days at the University of Akron to encourage careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The project focuses on the computationally driven, rational optimization of nanoalloy atomic composition and shape for catalytic performance in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Specific aims include the deterministic synthesis of Pt-M Nanocrystals (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn), the three-dimensional characterization of nanoalloy catalysts in atomic resolution and model refinements, as well as the prediction, tests, and optimization of the reactivity in the ORR. Methods comprise biomimetic synthesis protocols coupled with molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, ORR performance testing by voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, and in-situ monitoring of all reactions. The coordinates of the atoms in the synthesized nanostructures will be monitored by electron tomography to identify atomic ordering, to validate and improve interatomic potentials, and to predict reaction rates in ORR. Detailed understanding of alloy growth mechanism, shape control, and catalytic performance through new polarizable and reactive force fields for alloys and their aqueous interfaces from first principles will close a wide gap between experimental capabilities and missing theoretical understanding. Aided by thorough experimental characterization, predictions with unprecedented accuracy at length scales of 1 to 100 nm appear feasible, far beyond the limits of quantum-mechanical methods and building on previous successful models for interfaces of pure metals (CHARMM-METAL)."

The aim is to describe the strange magnetic behaviors of certain alloys. Over the past decades, physicists' investigation has generated a series of methodologies and predictions. In the community of mathematics, spin glass models are purely probabilistic objects that present highly complex random structures. The general aim of this research project is to pursue mathematical investigation of physical phenomena including the complexity of the random Hamiltonian, the structure of the Gibbs measure and the thermodynamic limit of the free energy. As well as being important in the field of probability, the tools and results obtained in this research plan are relevant to a variety of scientific branches including computer science, theoretical biology and social networks. <br/><br/>More precisely, this proposal is concerned about the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. The PI will investigate the structure and the role of the functional order parameter in the low temperature regime. In addition, the conjectured ultrametricity of the Gibbs measure and the problem of chaos in temperature will be analyzed following the Guerra-Talagrand replica symmetry breaking bound. The PI will as well study the central limit theorem for some physical quantities such as the overlap and magnetization especially at the critical temperature using Stein's method. Another direction is the SK model with heavy tail disorder. As now higher order interactions are allowed, the system has been predicted to exhibit unusual spin glass phenomena. The last part of the project involves the bipartite version of the SK model, which was used to model collective properties of two interactive large groups of individuals motivated by the studies of the social and neural networks, biology and economics. The PI will be concentrated on the computation of the limiting free energy."

The answer to this question is surprisingly unclear. On the one hand, there is good evidence that human activities have resulted in multiple species extinctions. But, on the other hand, ecologists also have found that large vertebrate consumers and predators, a category that includes humans, can have positive  ecosystem effects, as well. Large vertebrates may construct diverse habitats for other organisms, as a beaver does in damming a stream, or keep herbivore populations in balance through predation so that they do not overgraze plant communities, as wolves do for elk and deer. Removing this important -- or ""keystone"" -- species can cause catastrophic ecosystem transformation and the rapid extinction of a wide range of species that can no longer co-exist without the positive effects provided by the keystone. But ecologists also point out that the scope and scale of disturbance matters: if beavers were to flood huge areas, diversity would likely decrease, rather than increase; if wolves took too many elk, the elk population would crash and streams would be choked with too much vegetation, causing fish to suffer. Likewise, too few beaver ponds or too little predation on elk would be environmentally ineffective. Is there such a sweet spot of intermediate disturbance with the most positive effects for human activities, too? Anthropologist Dr. Rebecca L. Bird of Stanford University will investigate the idea that humans can be a keystone species through intensive study of a small-scale society, where environmental impacts tend to be more intermediate in scope and thus an excellent site for pursuing these questions.<br/><br/>Dr. Bird and her team will focus on one human disturbance in particular, indigenous burning, which appears to have helped to shape the distribution of plants and animals in many parts of the world for millennia. If indigenous populations function as a keystone species, native plants and animals may have coevolved with burning.  They are particularly interested in whether traditional burning by an indigenous population has positive impacts on both native plants and animals and, in so doing, helps to support indigenous welfare by facilitating reliance on traditional foods. Few indigenous communities in the United States are able to burn in traditional ways, so the team will travel to a remote community in the arid grasslands of Western Australia where burning has continued for millennia. The researchers will survey plant and animal species distributions over different habitat regions to see how they are affected by human hunting, gathering, and burning activities; develop a detailed desert food web; and analyze 25 years of satellite and aerial photography to map out the history of fire use in each region. These data will be used to develop and validate a computational fire landscape model to simulate foraging decision-making dynamics, social structures of sharing and resource distribution, and the effects of patch mosaic burning on landscape structure and composition, and small mammal habitat diversity. While the model will be developed for the Australian grassland case, it will be generalizable to other fire-dominated ecosystems, such as California. The researchers will bring the model to colleagues and collaborators in the Yurok tribe, who are currently attempting to restore native ecosystems and traditional foods with prescribed fire. Besides increasing scientific understanding of the ecological role of humans, findings from this research will inform conservation and land management policies. If the research supports the hypothesis that humans can act as keystones, the ecological goods and services they supply through traditional management may be quite significant, saving millions of dollars annually in habitat restoration and prescribed fire."

AP controllers are safety critical: excessive insulin delivery can lead to serious, potentially fatal, consequences. The verification framework under development allows designers of AP controllers to check that their control algorithms will operate safely and reliably against large disturbances that include patient meals, physical activities, and sensor anomalies including noise, delays, and sensor attenuation.  The intellectual merits of the project lie in the development of state-of-the-art formal verification tools, that reason over mathematical models of the closed-loop including external disturbances and insulin-glucose response. These tools perform an exhaustive exploration of the closed loop system behaviors, generating potentially adverse situations for the control algorithm under verification. In addition, automatic techniques are being investigated to help AP designers improve the control algorithm by tuning controller parameters to eliminate harmful behaviors and optimize performance. The broader significance and importance of the project are to minimize the manual testing effort for AP controllers, integrate formal tools in the certification process, and ultimately ensure the availability of safe and reliable devices to patients with type-1 diabetes. The framework is made available to researchers who are developing AP controllers to help them verify and iteratively improve their designs. The team is integrating the research into the educational mission by designing hands-on courses to train undergraduate students in the science of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) using the design of AP controllers as a motivating example. Furthermore, educational material that explains the basic ideas, current challenges and promises of the AP concept is being made available to a wide audience that includes patients with T1D, their families, interested students, and researchers.<br/><br/>The research is being carried out collaboratively by teams of experts in formal verification for Cyber-Physical Systems, control system experts with experience designing AP controllers, mathematical modeling experts, and clinical experts who have clinically evaluated AP controllers. To enable the construction of the verification framework from the current state-of-the-art verification tools, the project is addressing major research challenges, including (a) building plausible mathematical models of disturbances from available clinical datasets characterizing human meals, activity patterns, and continuous glucose sensor anomalies. The resulting models are integrated in a formal verification framework; (b) simplifying existing models of insulin glucose response using smaller but more complex delay differential models; (c) automating the process of abstracting the controller implementation for the purposes of verification; (d) producing verification results that can be interpreted by control engineers and clinical researchers without necessarily understanding formal verification techniques; and (e) partially automating the process of design improvements to potentially eliminate severe faults and improve performance. The  framework is evaluated on a set of promising AP controller designs that are currently under various stages of clinical evaluation."

In this research, state-of-the-art computational models and novel analysis tools will be created to determine the underlying physical mechanisms which govern the mechanics of three dimensional fiber networks. Specifically, a multiscale model will be developed to bridge different length scales and characterize the mechanical behavior in terms of morphological and microstructural properties.

Therefore, the outcomes of this project will be of great importance not only from a computational mechanics perspective but also as a computational framework for other scientists investigating properties of filamentous materials. A comprehensive educational plan and outreach activities are also planned to enhance the engagement of high school students in science and engineering disciplines, and to train the next generation of diverse and capable scientists and engineers.

Because of its distinctive chemistry, it plays central roles in many essential biochemical pathways that likely evolved early in life's history, possibly around or before 3.5 Ga.  At this time, the O2 concentrations were very low.  Many sulfur-containing compounds in cells react with O2, and aerobic organisms possess highly conserved pathways for their biosynthesis that are compatible with an aerobic environment.  The methanogenic archaea are an ancient lineage of strict anaerobes that never developed the ability to grow in the presence of O2.  Their sulfur metabolism is also very distinctive, suggesting that they may possess pathways common before O2 became abundant in the biosphere.  Unlike aerobes, most methanogenic archaea only use sulfide and elemental sulfur as the sulfur sources, and sulfate and other oxidized sulfur compounds are seldom utilized.  Recent biochemical and genomics studies have revealed unusual features of their sulfur assimilation, including a unique tRNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis pathway and the absence of canonical enzymes for Fe-S cluster and methionine biosynthesis.  Thus, how sulfur is incorporated in methanogens remains unknown.  Understanding the sulfur networks in methanogens will (i) advance our knowledge of the physiology of methanogens and how they are adapted to their unique ecological niche; (ii) discover novel enzymes and pathways of sulfur metabolism that may be common in other anaerobes; (iii) provide a more complete picture of sulfur chemistry in life and the evolution of the sulfur cycle on the early, anaerobic Earth; and (iv) guide engineering of methanogens for production of methane, a carbon neutral biofuel.  Integrated into these scientific goals will be interdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists, including high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and a young investigator.<br/><br/>Technical description: Sulfur is essential for the growth of all known organisms and is present in a wide variety of molecules with different physiological functions.  Consistent with their strictly anaerobic lifestyle, most methanogenic archaea only use sulfide and elemental sulfur as sulfur sources, and sulfate and other oxidized sulfur compounds are seldom utilized.  Recent studies have revealed novel features of sulfur assimilation in the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis.  These include: homologs of many sulfur metabolic genes common in bacteria and eukaryotes are absent; cysteine is biosynthesized by a novel tRNA-dependent pathway; cysteine is not an intermediate for Fe-S cluster, methionine and 4-thiouridine biosynthesis; and the sulfur transfer motif of the 4-thiouridine synthetase is distinct from that found in bacteria.  These discoveries greatly broadened our view of physiological sulfur chemistry.  However, many aspects of the sulfur transfer processes in methanococci remain to be elucidated.  An important question is whether sulfide is directly used as the sulfur donor in various pathways or unique sulfur carrier proteins are involved in sulfur relay.  This research specifically seeks to understand (i) the physiological sulfur transfer mechanism of tRNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis; (ii) the sulfur relay system of the archaeal ubiquitin-like pathway for tRNA 2-thiouridine biosynthesis; (iii) the enzymes and carriers in a global sulfur metabolic network; and (iv) the intracellular levels of sulfide available for these biochemical systems.<br/> <br/>Research on sulfur networks will advance our knowledge of the physiology of methanogens and how they are adapted to their unique ecological niche.  Since sulfate was limited on the early, anoxic Earth while sulfide and elemental sulfur were presumably abundant, methanogens that assimilate sulfide and elemental sulfur as sole sulfur sources provide a living window into the primitive sulfur metabolism and shed light on the evolutionary processes of early Earth.  Furthermore, most of our knowledge on sulfur assimilation is based upon aerobes and facultative anaerobes.  As many of the known sulfur transfer enzymes from bacteria and eukaryotes are missing in methanogens, the elucidation of sulfur relay in methanogens may guide discovery of novel sulfur metabolic pathways that may be common in other anaerobes; this will contribute to a more complete understanding of sulfur chemistry in life.  The broader impacts of this work include the following.  (i) Unraveling S metabolism in methanogens will assist modeling of their metabolism and bioengineering the production of methane, a carbon neutral biofuel.  (ii) It will provide new insights into mechanisms to control emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.  (iii) This study will develop a new genome-wide screening method, which will be of great value for systematic discoveries of novel pathways in an archaeal model organism.  (iv) This project will provide interdisciplinary training to the next generation of scientists, including high school, undergraduate and graduate students, in microbial physiology, biochemistry and genetics.  It will encourage students to view the entirety of the organism as it exists within a specific ecological context.  (v) It will establish a path to independence for the CoPI Dr. Liu, a young investigator."

While much is known about the properties of invasive plants and animals, much less is known about the beneficial microbes (microscopic organisms) that accompany introduced species. Rhizobia are beneficial bacteria that inhabit leguminous plant root tissue where they convert nitrogen from the atmosphere to a plant-available form. Leguminous plants provide these microbes with sugars from photosynthesis. Legumes that disperse to habitats that lack these bacteria are typically unable to persist, however the bacteria can also spread through the soil or air. The aim of this research is to examine whether invasions change the nature of a mutualistic interaction.  The investigators will study specialization and the evolution of cooperation in both natural and experimentally staged invasions for two plant species and their beneficial microbes. While this question has been addressed in aboveground systems, this is one of the first to utilize a belowground plant mutualism. This project will promote diversity in the sciences, provide research training and education in the biology of plant-microbe interactions, and inform efforts to control invasive plants. Diverse undergraduate students from Florida International University will participate in summer research at University of California at Riverside and Michigan State University.

Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner."

The fossil record demonstrates that our morphology stands in contrast to that of our ancestors, who evolved to have large, strong teeth, massive jaws and powerful chewing muscles. Evolutionary explanations for this change include competing hypotheses as to how natural selection on diet drove adaptation over the course of human evolution.  These hypotheses suggest that the presence or absence of either very hard or very tough foods may have been a critical factor influencing the evolution of our ancestors.  Alternatively, the hardness or toughness of foods may have been less important than the behaviors (i.e., biting, puncturing, crushing, twisting, grinding) used to process foods of various shape and size with the jaws and teeth. This project will provide evidence to differentiate between these selective scenarios, thereby contributing to a fuller understanding of the evolutionary processes that have shaped this important aspect of modern human anatomy.<br/><br/>This research will require focus on a primate model, South American capuchins, which exhibit the relevant diversity in musculoskeletal anatomy and diet requisite to testing hypotheses regarding how food properties (i.e., hardness, toughness) or feeding behaviors influence the evolution of feeding adaptations.  The study integrates observations of capuchin feeding behavior in the wild with laboratory experiments, advanced computer modeling using engineering methods, examination of the microscopic damage done to teeth by food and other items (i.e., dental microwear), the determination of the material properties (i.e., hardness, toughness) of food resources in the wild, and the collection and analysis of abrasive particles adhering to those foods (that might be influencing microwear patterns).  Collectively, these data in capuchins will allow us to evaluate the assumptions underlying our interpretations of the interrelationships between dietary behavior, food resources, and the biology of our human ancestors, thereby transforming our understanding of human evolutionary history.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are considerable.  In relation to the public understanding of science, the research provides information that will address a topic of great public interest; namely, our own evolutionary history.  As a related benefit, the project illustrates how ecological factors affecting other animals may be equally relevant and impactful for our own species.  In terms of STEM training, research training opportunities are provided for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom are expected (based on past history at the collaborating institutions) to be young female scientists.  The project also contributes to environmental awareness by collecting basic ecological data relevant to rainforest conservation.  In the process of doing so, it further develops collaborative ties with international counterparts and institutions.  Lastly, the project illustrates to the engineering community how their methods can be used to answer evolutionary questions."
