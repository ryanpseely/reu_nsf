Yet extracting value from this data is a challenge; every step requires human intervention: cleaning the data, identifying useful features, and choosing a machine learning model. The goal of this project is to develop new methods to accelerate and automate the basic machine learning (ML) workflow. Automation frees data scientists from data cleaning and parameter twiddling to concentrate on the important questions: are we solving the right problems, and do we have the right data? This project will help democratize machine learning and promote data-driven decision making by developing automated methods to clean data and to choose ML models, including open source software packages, that make these methods widely available and easy to use. The project also advances these goals by training data scientists in how to use these models and understand their potential risks. <br/><br/>Low dimensional structure provides the key to meeting the diverse challenges required to automate machine learning. This project relies on the central insight is that measurements of a complex object, such as a patient in a hospital, respondent on a survey, or even a ML dataset, can be well described as simple functions (or even linear functions) of an underlying low dimensional latent vector. The project develops new algorithms and software to identify low dimensional latent vectors and to use them to a) clean the data by denoising observations or imputing missing entries, b) reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors, and c) recommend better algorithms. This project will develop new techniques to identify low dimensional latent vectors from sparse observations via nonlinear (even, discontinuous) functions, with efficient algorithms and with theoretical guarantees. To enable more efficient automated machine, the project will develop methods localize similar datasets near each other in a low dimensional space, so that nearness in this space predicts similar performance of machine learning methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite significant technical advances in software security, insecure software remains a common problem, sometimes with disastrous results. Solving this problem will require understanding how human decision-making interacts with technology in the process of secure software development. However, studying these human factors is typically expensive, time-consuming and difficult, for several reasons: professional developers are a small and hard-to-reach study population, professional software development is a complex task that can be hard to mimic in a study environment, and security is, despite its criticality, often a secondary goal that can be difficult to study directly. Researchers attempting to conduct such studies must make many choices about experimental design while balancing complexity, time and cost constraints, and validity or usefulness of expected results. Unfortunately, there is little evidence-based guidance as to how best to make these choices. By conducting a variety of experiments directly comparing the effects of different experimental design choices on studies of human-centered secure development, this project will help future researchers design better experiments and deploy their resources as effectively as possible.<br/><br/>This project will improve the validity and reliability of developer-centered security research by empirically establishing best practices and tradeoffs, building on best practices from the usable security and empirical software engineering communities. Researchers will undertake a series of methodological studies and experiments in three key areas: (a) how to design appropriate programming tasks; (b) how to choose a study environment that effectively balances experimental control with ecological validity; and (c) how to measure relevant outcomes such as developer self-efficacy and API usability. Investigators will test these critical questions of study design across multiple underlying research questions, such as comparisons of APIs, documentation resources, and security tools. The results will provide deep insights into how tradeoffs among design decisions play out in different kinds of studies, allowing researchers to make informed choices that fit best in their context. The results will be synthesized into comprehensive guidelines to help researchers conduct better studies, acquire stronger evidence, and therefore improve the process of secure development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this goal, the project will lay the foundation for improving recruitment of undergraduates into STEM teaching careers.  An innovative component of the project is its plan to engage students in ecological studies specific to inner-city neighborhoods.  This urban environmental science component is expected to provide a ?living laboratory? that can help students see the relevance of science to their daily lives.  It will also provide an innovative way to learn STEM concepts, to expose students in entry level STEM classes to potential careers in STEM teaching, and to inspire future teachers.  The outcomes of this capacity building project will lay the foundation for a future Noyce Teacher Scholarships and Stipends (Track 1) proposal. <br/><br/>This project at Iona College includes partnerships with Westchester Community College and the high-need New Rochelle School District. The project?s long-term goal is to increase the number of highly qualified STEM teachers in high-need school districts in New York.  The specific aims are to: evaluate factors that impede student enrollment in STEM education; develop a recruitment pipeline with high-need school districts and local two-year colleges; enhance partnerships with local schools for future student teacher placements; and develop an urban environmental science module that will be integrated into introductory chemistry and biology courses.

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will consider a class of complex molecularly branched ionic polymers with various chemical compositions, morphologies and tunable physical properties in order to understand composition-structure-property relationships and enhance ion-group mobility.  These novel ion-containing polymeric materials will be synthesized to contain a high concentration of well-ordered charged groups.  They will be processed into continuous morphologies and investigated by various advanced techniques.  This approach will provide an organized material platform with potentially high and controlled ionic transport, as well as liquid electrolytes with low temperature and mechanical stability.  Such organized multi-functional polymeric materials with controlled continuous morphologies are important for prospective novel solid polyelectrolyte media.  These could offer potential for new lightweight, robust, temperature-stable, and safe batteries to replace current liquid-based batteries.  This research will be integrated with a multifaceted educational program for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to high school students and the general public to cultivate their interest in nanomaterials and more broadly STEM careers.   <br/><br/><br/>PART 2.  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will consider newly synthesized branched poly(ionic liquid)s with different functional cores, ion species, and degrees of ionization.  The PI's group will explore different chemical architectures to promote various micellar morphologies and their assembly into continuous percolated networks across multiple spatial scales starting from individual macromolecules and extending to the formation of long-range interconnected anisotropic core-shell morphologies.  The project is focused on understanding the role of highly asymmetric compositions of new multicomponent branched ion-containing polymers.  These will be tailored to yield continuous domain morphologies via emergence of long-range and network organization such as expanded interconnected cylindrical and nanotubular micelles.  The general hypothesis of the proposed research is that branched macromolecular architectures with multiple functionalities can be leveraged to mediate the organization of poly(ionic liquid)s and guide their assembly into predictable, percolated morphologies of interconnected domains that are distinct from those normally encountered in discrete nanostructures.  The experimental plan will enable a systematic and predictive understanding of component-structure-property relationships for these complex materials.  <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its products will include a publicly accessible database and a book that should appeal broadly to college students and to lay people, teaching them about animal behavior in general, and carnivore behavior in particular. The book will focus on a continuous long-term study of spotted hyenas in Kenya that was started in early 1988. It will explain what these bizarre animals have taught us about a number of different topics, including how they manage to bring down prey three times their own size without help from other hunters, how they rear their daughters to dominate their sons, how they can eat large doses of anthrax bacteria without feeling ill, and how they manage to usurp food from lions. This project will leverage long term data following the behavior of individual hyenas over their lifetime and their reproductive success to understand these phenomena. Finally, the researcher will continue to collaborate with several media outlets including National Geographic Television - that have recently documented her research with spotted hyenas. This research will provide insights into the unique combination of features leading to the evolution of one of the world?s strangest mammals; the products will be of broad interest to behavioral ecologists, wildlife managers, and conservation biologists.<br/><br/>This project will entail a synthesis of over three decades of research on the evolutionary ecology of what is arguably the more puzzling of all mammals. Spotted hyenas puzzle us with their morphology, their behavior, their physiology, their cognitive abilities, their social lives, and their evolutionary origins. Products of this synthesis will include both a book and a clean database ready to hand over to a new generation of biologists hoping to continue field study of spotted hyenas in Kenya into the future. The book will address questions about spotted hyenas at all four of Niko Tinbergen?s analytical levels, weaving together all that we have discovered in regard to their ontogeny, their physiology, and the adaptive significance of their behavioral, intellectual and morphological traits in light of their phylogenetic history. The book will also focus on spotted hyenas as ?brain-teasers' in each of these topical areas. The database documents behavior, physiology, development, rank and genealogical relationships with data collected daily since early 1988 from up to seven generations of hyenas belonging to six study clans in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.

Design activities for engineering systems across infrastructure, aerospace, and defense domains more closely resemble a collective decision-making process than centralized authority in traditional systems engineering practice. This topic is of interest because U.S. agencies and firms are actively architecting systems with decentralized decision authority, described variously as Internet 4.0, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-things, or systems-of-systems across domains, including energy, transportation, manufacturing, and space systems. The design of these engineering systems differs from that of other systems because their large scale, long lifetime, and proximity to social systems evoke complex features such as adaptation, self-organization, and emergence, which take place over strategic timescales. A deeper understanding of how strategic dynamics impact designer interactions across theoretical and empirical perspectives can help to avoid costly overruns and cancellations by identifying and mitigating undesirable dynamics in conceptual design phases. Advances in systems engineering must develop theory, methods, and tools to coordinate and facilitate collective design activities. <br/><br/>This project builds on a line of economic methods applied to engineering design including utility theory, decision theory, social choice, and game theory. Collective systems design is modeled as a bi-level problem, where lower-level decisions correspond to an optimization problem and upper-level strategy decisions correspond to a coordination game. Normative models of agent behavior are based on classical and Bayesian game theory with utility functions incorporating behavioral factors such as risk attitudes. Multi-agent simulation studies evolution of strategies under repeated interaction among agents. Behavioral experiments collect empirical data about human decision-making for validation. The research will contribute new knowledge about how to characterize, study, and modify the strategic dynamics of engineering systems during conceptual design phases. The educational plan develops and delivers simulation activities to model systems problems by combining technical modeling and social interaction. The simulation activities behave as a highly abstracted model system to elicit rich strategic behaviors through face-to-face interaction, engage students with challenges of socio-technical problems, and retain computational tractability to teach analytical methods in educational contexts. Development and broad public dissemination of simulations in the context of Earth science space missions will expose a wide audience to strategic issues of government-commercial interdependency in space systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An L-function is a special kind of function that packages together information about an arithmetical object that arises from studying it modulo p for each prime p. For instance, the Riemann zeta function is the simplest example of an L-function and has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers.  Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding if certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the L-function is at a special point.  Much of this project concerns the development of new tools for studying how L-functions may fit into families and using these tools to better understand individual L-functions. The investigator will continue to advise PhD students and to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, especially through the Texas A&M Research Experience for Undergraduates.  This type of mentorship is invaluable in preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The project will study new families of L-functions and use them as tools for estimating L-functions on the critical line.

Another line of work concerns new variants on the quantum unique ergodicity problem, which connects families of L-functions to properties of automorphic forms. With his undergraduate students, the investigator will study properties of generalized Dedekind sums.

The model explicitly considers human-machine interaction dynamics, mutual learning, and multi-level intent inference.

Tuning of polymer crystallization through the macromolecular chain structures or through high-order structural assemblies has been improved over the last half century.  However, a fundamental problem of widespread importance is to understand the mechanism of polymer crystallization at the molecular level.  Many factors, such as molecular entanglement, mobility, molecular weight, solvent-polymer or polymer-polymer interactions, polymer concentration, and others influence the chain-level structure of semicrystalline polymers during crystallization.  This project is aimed at characterizing intramolecular and intermolecular structures of specially labeled semicrystalline polymers in crystals grown from the melt or from solution. The research is expected to enhance foundations about:  (i) entanglement effects on chain-folding structure in melt-grown crystals,  (ii) molecular weight effects on chain-folding motif in single crystals,  (iii) early stage of polymer crystallization in dilute solutions,  (iv) chiral recognition of helical polymers, and  (v) molecular dynamics of stereoregular polyolefin-type materials. The established foundations will be important for understanding crystallization mechanisms and for designing novel polymer materials. Graduate students trained in this project will acquire broad experimental skills covering polymer synthesis, materials characterization, advanced NMR characterization, and numerical simulations. They will have opportunities to present technical talks and posters at national and regional meetings.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Long and flexible semicrystalline polymers fold to various extents during crystallization. Folding generates intramolecular packing in addition to intermolecular packing. Understanding of intramolecular and intermolecular packing structures is essential in the crystallization process of long polymer chains. This project will focus on evaluation of the intramolecular and intermolecular packing structures of 13C labeled semicrystalline polymers in solution and melt-grown crystals by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) will be used as a model system, since established decomposition route allows us to re-use 13C labeled monomer to effectively synthesize a variety of 13C labeled PLAs with precisely controlled and diverse molecular weights from 2K to over 100K g/mol. First, the project is aimed at entanglement effects on the intramolecular packing structure of poly(L-lactic acid) by investigating  (i) Mw effect on the chain-folding structure and  (ii) blending effect of low Mw component on the chain-folding structure of long chains in melt-grown crystals.  A second thrust aims at elucidating  (i) Mw effect on the molecular dimension of the folded chains in solution-grown crystals and (ii) precursor structure in dilute solutions. Recently developed Dynamic Nuclear Polarization NMR significantly enhances sensitivity of the 13C labeled polymer signals (~ 400 times) and thus may allow to directly analyze the chain-level structure of 13C labeled polymer in the frozen solution state. This experiment will shed light on the early stage of polymer crystallization at the molecular level. A third thrust aims at understanding the importance of both intermolecular and intramolecular packing on polymer crystallization. A model system of PLA stereocomplex will be used to address Mw effects on both intramolecular and intermolecular packing structures. Finally, detailed molecular dynamics and mechanical properties of recently developed polyolefins will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This expansion has increased transmission of infectious diseases to humans, companion animals, and wildlife. Understanding the environmental conditions that constrain establishment and maintenance of tick populations at their northern range limits may enhance our ability to predict future range expansion. Further, better understanding of tick distribution will facilitate targeting vector management strategies to life-stages and times of year when ticks are most vulnerable. The goal of this project is to identify specific biological mechanisms by which abiotic factors limit the current northern geographic distribution of the blacklegged tick, an important disease vector in North America. A strong climate gradient in Maine, an emerging area of tick-borne disease transmission, will be used to understand the effects of temperature and precipitation on winter survival and seasonal host-seeking activity in the black-legged tick. In addition, the relationship between tick range expansion and spread of three tick-bourne pathogens will be examined. This project will provide training opportunities for numerous undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. Also, the researchers will organize public outreach focused on safe and effective personal tick protection practices.<br/><br/>The project will integrate manipulative field experiments and observational field studies to test several hypotheses regarding environmental constraints on range expansion of the blacklegged tick, as well as implications of range expansion on the distribution of tick-borne pathogens. In particular, researchers will examine large-scale environmental gradients to better understand: 1) interacting effects of temperature and snow cover on blacklegged tick overwinter survival, 2) impacts of climate on tick host-seeking phenology, and 3) co-invasion dynamics of the blacklegged tick and three pathogens it transmits. These objectives will be addressed by establishing experimental tick overwinter survival assays and host-seeking behavioral assays at five field sites in Maine representing spanning a range of temperature and snowfall conditions. In addition, observational studies of off-host and on-host ticks in the same locations will be conducted at the same locations. The combination of manipulative field experiments and observational field studies utilized in this research effort will simultaneously isolate abiotic constraints on the current geographic distribution of the blacklegged tick while preserving the ecological realism of natural conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different from virtual reality, which displays virtual content but blocks out the view of the real world, AR enables mixtures such as a virtual representation of a remote person sitting in a real conference room with other people. Other examples of AR applications include: (i) science students visualizing the invisible flow of electricity moving through wires in their circuits or visualize unseen forces such as magnetism or atmospheric currents in their real-world environment; (ii) doctors overlaying an X-ray-like view of internal organs during exams or laparoscopic surgery. This project aims to answer a complex and important question: how does human visual system perceive the mix of virtual AR content and the real world? The researchers will build a model of perception of the visual characteristics of AR systems, including color, brightness, depth, and graphics quality, with data from experiments that test visual responses. The model will mimic visual adaptation to different lighting environments, such as indoors versus outdoors, as well as compensations for reflections and other interactions with the environment. The project will result in improved AR system designs, including responsive algorithms that react to changes in the environment and anticipate the visual perception of the user. It will also result in a better scientific understanding of the human visual system, which has the potential to improve many other visual interfaces in addition to AR. Integrating the project with education, the researchers will develop and test AR learning modules for university courses in science, math, and art, leading to improved learning. By improving the understanding of visual perception in AR, this project will help enable visually accurate, more comfortable, and more responsive AR display systems. These have the potential to enhance the visual sense in applications such as education, medicine, and transportation.<br/><br/>This project aims to build a robust computational model of visual appearance in AR systems that takes into account visual adaptation, cognitive interpretations, and the optical interaction between virtually displayed content and real objects and illumination in the environment. Visual experiments will employ psychophysical scaling, color matching via adjustment, and constant stimuli tasks to understand the influence of the luminance, color, contrast, complexity, and depth of both the AR virtual foreground and the real-world background. A model of color and material appearance in transparent AR environments will build on the working hypothesis that the perceived color is a non-physical addition of foreground and background whose weightings depend on cognitive discounting of the layers. Additional experiments will measure visual luminance and chromatic adaptation in temporally changing AR viewing environments, for instance, asking observers to adjust displayed AR and real-world stimuli to be achromatic in different lighting situations and at different adaptation times. The physical lighting environment, including the location, intensity, and color of light sources and bright objects, will be sensed with cameras and color sensors as input to responsive display algorithms utilizing the developed model of visual adaptation and appearance in AR. The responsive algorithms will ensure robust, predictable color appearance and display. During the project, several AR education applications incorporating the research results will be developed for validation and testing. Classroom assessments by students and faculty will evaluate these applications for validating the research results. AR will be adopted in the research group?s graduate color science courses as a tool for demonstrating adaptation and surround effects and as an environment for practicing psychophysical methods with experiments related to the ongoing research. The researchers will share their computational model and experimental findings via publication and professional organizations, with the goal of meaningful implementation both in AR system design and AR applications. Further, the impact of AR and the fascinating topic of color science will be shared with the community through the University?s open houses and the recruiting of students and faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EB students in linguistically diverse mathematics classrooms are frequently limited to procedural, rote instruction, despite research-based recommendations that suggest that EBs' mathematical and linguistic proficiency can benefit from engaging in complex mathematical tasks based on real-life situations. The project will support teacher capacity for implementing mathematical modeling lessons by engaging teachers in co-planning and co-teaching with researchers skilled in EB mathematics instruction. The project will collect information about the quality of mathematics instruction in modeling lessons, what students learn, and how teachers changed in how they position EB students as knowers and doers of mathematics. The outcomes of this project will be a framework for teaching mathematical modeling to EB students, teacher professional development materials that can be used widely to support EB mathematics teachers, and a massive open online course (MOOC) for teachers to support their continued learning about teaching mathematics modeling to EB students.<br/><br/>The project draws on three important constructs related to teaching mathematics to emergent bilingual (EB) students: research on the mathematics education of EB students; research on mathematical modeling; and positioning theory. Related to mathematics education of EB students, the project supports teachers in enacting high-quality instruction that incldues high cognitive demand tasks, encourages EBs to engage in and explain their problem solving process, and complements that work with linguistic and contextual supports that support EB students' entry into the tasks. Related to mathematical modeling, the project makes use of the conceptualization of modeling as a vehicle for content (as compared to mathematics content of its own), and envisions the use of modeling practices as particularly supportive of EB students' learning of algebra.  In particular, the modeling-as-a-vehicle stance invites teachers to engage students in tasks that contain multiple mathematical representations, which has the potential to both build students' conceptual understandings of algebra and to strengthen EBs' language and communication skills in the context of mathematics. With respect to positioning theory, the project seeks to disrupt the finding that secondary mathematics teachers tend underestimate EB students' mathematical abilities due to their English proficiency standards, causing them to choose lower cognitive demand tasks for these students against established research-based recommendations. The project team will engage EB algebra and pre-algebra teachers in Des Moines Public schools in co-planning and co-teaching lessons using mathematical modeling practice.  This co-planning and co-teaching activity constitutes in-situ professional development for teachers.  Co-planning sessions, co-taught lessons, and regular teacher interviews will be recorded and analyzed for quality of instruction and changes in teacher positioning of EB students. The research team and teachers will co-analyze student learning data from observations and district-administered standardized assessments to better understand the impact of the modeling lessons on students' algebra learning and achievement. Eight teachers will participate in the work over the life of the project, each supporting EB classes of approximately 20 students per teacher. The outcomes of these analyses will guide the development fo a mathematical modeling framework for teaching EBs, teacher professional development materials made available for similar work in other schools and districts, and a massive open online course designed for teachers to develop their skills for teaching secondary mathematics to EB students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These stereotypes are so prevalent that simply reminding someone about their age, gender, or race can negatively affect performance on a challenging exam. Such negative stereotypes about mental aptitude have been linked to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Further, this underrepresentation and lack of diversity in people working with technology has been shown to limit innovation and creativity in technological fields. This project will investigate novel uses of virtual reality technology to combat the negative effects of stereotypes about women and underrepresented minorities that currently deter them from participating in STEM disciplines. Virtual reality technology enables its users to see the world through the eyes of, and take on certain behavioral characteristics of, someone else. This project will advance the understanding of the effects of virtual reality by investigating its ability to buffer people from negative stereotypes by briefly taking on the characteristics of someone else. This virtual perspective change is expected to limit the negative effects of stereotype threat that deter students from underrepresented groups from majoring in STEM disciplines, and therefore increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.<br/> <br/>This project integrates research and education initiatives investigating the effects of virtual avatars on reducing the negative effects of stereotypes and biases in the classroom. The project will 1) demonstrate that avatars can positively mediate implicit behavior in ways that affect attitudinal changes lasting outside of virtual environments, 2) formulate a protocol for inducing lasting behavioral changes based on different hardware specifications, 3) produce a novel methodology for personalizing avatar and environment specifications given an individual's unique characteristics, and 4) deploy curriculum guidelines for the integration of virtual reality technology applications into classrooms to positively affect group behavior and increase retention for underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. Personalized virtual experiences, along with curricular guidelines for deployment, will be generated and evaluated through data collected from a multi-institutional experiment in introductory computer science courses at three different institutions: a private liberal arts college, a public state university, and a community college.

Due to their high sensitivity and time resolution, SPADs are driving an imaging revolution, enabling extreme applications that were hitherto considered impossible: imaging at trillion frames-per-second, non-line-of-sight imaging, and microscopic imaging at nano time-scales. Despite these capabilities, SPADs are considered specialized devices used only in ultra-dark environments and restricted to a limited set of niche applications. This project develops technologies to expand the scope of SPADs as general-purpose cameras with a broad range of applications. The developed technologies will not only spur wide-spread adoption of SPADs in fields like life science, astronomy, and medicine, where operating with the smallest amount of light possible is critical to success, but also enable new, highly demanding applications. 3D cameras will be able to achieve substantially higher depth resolution than current state-of-the-art at long distances, enabling vehicles (aerial, terrestrial, and underwater) to navigate autonomously in challenging weather conditions and on rugged terrains. The results from this research will be disseminated through scientific conferences and journals. Some materials will be integrated into a textbook on active 3D imaging techniques. <br/><br/>This research develops mathematical and physical foundations for a new class of imaging and computational techniques which will transform SPADs into `all-purpose' cameras capable of operating in diverse conditions (dark to bright sunlight), for recovering high-quality images and 3D scene information over the entire gamut of imaging conditions.

They consist of long chains of chemical units that carry both positive and negative charges.  A number of new polyzwitterions will be designed and made in the laboratory with different chemical structures, and then studied to find the best ones for technological applications. They will be tested for heat stability, mechanical strength, and ability to absorb or reject water. The studies will provide a knowledge base which is needed to more rationally develop new materials for a range of applications. It is expected that the proposed research on polyzwitterions will benefit society in important ways. Polyzwitterions may be useful for biomedical uses such as hydrogels or wound dressings. In the field of water purification, polyzwitterions may improve the properties of filtration membranes leading to better water treatment systems. How polyzwitterion molecules interact with each other in the presence of water or salts will be important information for the field of energy technology, leading to new batteries for energy storage.

Thermal measurements will be augmented with structural characterization. The technical objectives are to: 1. synthesize an array of polyzwitterions and investigate fundamental thermal properties of cast films in relationship to variations of chemical chain structure and content of salt; 2. measure fundamental thermal properties of PZIs using fast scanning calorimetry to minimize effects of degradation; 3. investigate the structure of PZIs with respect to formation of intra- and interchain cross-linking as functions of salt content, which can mediate this cross-linking. High precision, high accuracy heat capacity measurements will be made to quantify the solid and liquid states, and their dependence upon bound water and salt content. Specifically, the role of LiCl salt will be investigated as to its impact on the thermal and structural properties of PZIs. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry will be performed on PZI cast films to provide fundamental thermal properties such as the solid state heat capacity. Differential fast scanning chip calorimetry will be used to study these materials at 2000 K/s to avoid degradation, to obtain the dry-state glass transition temperature, liquid-state heat capacity, and heat capacity increment at the glass transition. Glass forming ability will be studied for PZIs in the presence or absence of added salt.

In some cases, these elements are known to be vital to biological processes and ocean food webs. Near the shore, rivers are a large source for material from land to the ocean. Beyond the reach of rivers, and for most of the oceans, material blown from land through the air is the largest source of trace elements to surface waters. This material enters the oceans dissolved in rain or by settling of dust particles. Understanding atmospheric sources of trace elements to the oceans is thus important to understanding both global chemical cycles and patterns of biological production. This project will sample the atmosphere and the surface ocean near Hawaii over two years to gain a deeper understanding of the sources and fates of trace metals in the ocean. The study will examine how particles from the atmosphere interact with the surrounding water as they sink through the ocean. The project will contribute to global synthesis and modeling efforts. It will directly support graduate and undergraduate students. Results of the project and their relevance will be communicated to the public through campus open house events and a public lecture series.<br/><br/>The processes that supply and remove trace elements in the ocean are ongoing areas of research. An important focus is on understanding the sources and fate of aerosol trace elements deposited to the ocean as this represents a major source of micronutrients and contaminants into the open ocean. Field observations of wet and dry atmospheric inputs are limited in number, and few methods are available to transform readily measured aerosol trace element concentrations into deposition fluxes. Thus, atmospheric fluxes of trace elements to most ocean regions remain poorly constrained and their impact on ocean biochemical cycles, including the marine carbon cycle, are uncertain. Directly quantifying atmospheric fluxes of key trace elements to the ocean and identifying their fates and chemical transformations after deposition are critical areas of continued investigation and are included, for example, as a core component of the GEOTRACES program. Similarly, aerosol fractional solubility and the flux of bioavailable trace elements is not well understood. There is a corresponding need to test and improve estimates of total dust deposition fluxes alongside simultaneous observations of particle composition in the open ocean. This project will address these needs through a two-year land-based sampling effort and six seasonal cruises aimed at three tasks. (1) Use the deposition flux of beryllium-7 measured from aerosols, precipitation, and the upper ocean inventory to directly estimate dust and aerosol trace element fluxes to the Hawaii Ocean Time-series Station Aloha, a representative and remote oligotrophic site. This region is characterized by a predictable seasonal variability in dust concentrations and precipitation and is an exceptionally applicable region for testing the limits of dust deposition techniques by observing seasonal variability in ocean-atmosphere coupling over a multi-year cycle. (2) Explore the extent to which seasonal variations in aerosol trace element flux to the surface of the North Pacific, and mineralogy of that input drive variability in the composition and inventories of marine particles. (3) Investigate the extent to which the fractional solubility of aerosol trace elements collected over the North Pacific shows temporal variability and calculate flux rates of soluble aerosol trace elements. The study will advance understanding of dust and soluble aerosol trace element flux from the atmosphere to the ocean and link that flux to upper ocean particle inventory, mineralogy, and chemical composition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Funded by NSF's Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Connie Lu of the University of Minnesota is investigating Lewis acidic sigma-acceptor metalloligands to enable new modes of reactivity at a base metal by leveraging the M?LA bonding interaction between the base metal (M) and the Lewis acid (LA). Recently, M?LA complexes have emerged as an important class of bifunctional catalysts, where the LA has predominantly been a main group ion. For this project, Professor Lu and her team are targeting M-LA catalysts centered on base metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and lanthanide ions to achieve the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate, and ultimately, to methanol. The team also aims to expand the catalytic scope of these bifunctional complexes by targeting C-C bond formation processes that leverage the unique cooperativity of the M-LA active site.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their vibrations typically occur at frequencies corresponding to infrared light. Thus, by observing how molecules absorb different wavelengths of infrared light (the laboratory technique is called vibrational spectroscopy), we can tell something about their structure and properties.  However, as molecules become large (in other words ?polyatomic?, meaning many atoms), or if a small molecule is surrounded by other molecules (for example, an alcohol molecule dissolved in water), their vibrations become very complicated and difficult to interpret. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A of the Chemistry Division, Professor Edwin Sibert of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is extending current theoretical models in order to enhance our ability to extract structural information from the vibrations of polyatomic molecules and molecules dissolved in liquids. This research is expected to enhance our ability to interpret get a detailed picture of a molecule?s structure and its interaction with other molecules in its environment.  The models developed in this research also have implications for understanding complex biochemical processes as well as the practical design of molecules for a variety of applications, including pharmaceuticals and fuels.  Finally, the Sibert research group is also developing electronic learning resources for the undergraduate chemistry program at UW Madison.  Professor Silbert is involved in the design of electronic resources for students. These resources extend from helping students understand the forces at play in solvation phenomena to educating them about the significant contributions of chemistry to our society.<br/><br/>Liquid phase infrared spectra of the CH, NH and OH stretch regions often lack the spectral resolution required to interrogate how the motions of nuclei evolve upon molecular excitation. The analogous molecular motions sampled in cold clusters are governed by similar forces, yet, due to the limited cluster size and cold temperatures, the experimental spectra of these high frequency vibrations have sufficiently narrow line shapes that spectral features are revealed. The aim of this project is to provide the theoretical tools that are required for interpreting these features in order to both reveal the underlying dynamics and extract structural and environmental information. The limited size of these clusters also allows for the rigorous testing of the theoretical models. This testing includes quantifying the quality of the techniques used to determine the underlying force fields. Designing drugs and predicting outcomes of combustion reactions depend on chemists? ability to determine such force fields in order to calculate the relative stabilities of various chemical species and understand how environment affects those stabilities. The broader impact of this project includes generating open source computer software to enable scientists to measure and understand these stabilities as well as to provide a training ground for students in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is driven by mechanical forces, which will be studied.  This work is important because it will expand our knowledge about tissue packing, which has relevance to human development.  For example, improper packing of the intestine during embryonic development is linked to birth defects with limited cures.  The research component of this award will help us understand 1) how molecular cues control mechanical forces that organize the small intestine, 2) how those forces in turn feed back on cell behavior, and 3) how variations in the mechanical process of shaping the small intestine helps distinct species meet their unique nutritional needs.  This work will include a mix of experiments and mathematical models.  There is also an educational component to this award.  High-school juniors will have a week-long lesson about the connections between physiology, engineering, and developmental biology, with the small intestine as an example.  High-performing high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds will learn about cloning and molecular biology, embryology, and biomechanics as part of Columbia University?s Hypothekids Hk Makers program.

The work performed in this award will fill a portion of this gap by focusing on looping of the small intestine, a process driven by mechanical buckling of the initially straight intestinal tube.  The underlying biological cues that control buckling during development remain elusive. This award combines mechanical testing, mathematical modeling, and retroviral gene misexpression in the developing chick embryo to study how bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling controls buckling morphogenesis in the small intestine, how forces generated during looping morphogenesis feedback on cell behaviors that drive buckling, and finally, how changes to genes controlling tissue mechanics underlie the emergence of morphological diversity across species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will first study the relationship between the form, function, and mechanics of these junctions.  This work will then study how these features may be regulated to influence the integrity of the endothelial barrier.  Endothelial cells form a critical semi-permeable barrier that controls the flux of ions, molecules, and cells into and out of vasculature. When an organism is healthy, the integrity of the endothelial cell barrier is tightly regulated.  It can become dysregulated in conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, or neurological diseases.  The dysregulation can be in the form of spatial heterogeneity or a change in temporal dynamics.  Regardless, this dysregulation poses a challenge for drug delivery.  Cells exposed to the same environment can demonstrate phenotypic (form) differences. These cell-cell heterogeneities may have important functional significance.  This work is important because a better understanding of the links between endothelial cell-cell junction form, function, and mechanics could lead to image-based functional predictions about endothelial barrier integrity in both models and in living vessels.  These predictions could ultimately lead to improved drug delivery methods.  This research project will employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates aspects of engineering, biology, and physics using novel software. The research project will also develop outreach initiatives featuring a series of research training modules for undergraduate and graduate students, partnerships with rural high schools, new labs and problem sets that synergize research and education in an undergraduate biomechanics class, a podcast highlighting diverse experiences in STEM careers, and training and mentoring efforts.  As an award to an early-career researcher, completion of the research and outreach work will launch the investigator's career in both research and outreach.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to discover how local alterations in endothelial cell-cell junction phenotype, and its dynamic rearrangements, contribute to local permeability of the endothelium to molecules and cells, and the degree to which this relationship is conserved across varying mechanical conditions, genetic alterations, junction types, and vascular beds from which the endothelial cells are derived. The research objectives are to (1) determine the role of endothelial cell-cell junction phenotype in controlling local permeability of the endothelium; (2) assess how endothelial cell-cell junction mechanics influence junction phenotype in response to external mechanical cues; and (3) determine how dynamic changes in endothelial cell-cell junction phenotype and mechanics contribute to local permeability of the endothelium. This work will establish the potential for a novel systems mechanobiology approach using microfabricated vascular models, molecular biology, advanced microscopy techniques, and custom software for quantitative analysis of the form, function, and mechanics of cell-cell junctions in the vascular endothelium. The following questions regarding endothelial cell mechanobiology will be answered: (i) can endothelial cell-cell junction phenotype and/or dynamics be used to quantitatively predict local permeability to molecules and/or cells; (ii) does intercellular junction phenotype quantitatively correlate with cell-cell or cell-matrix tension; and (iii) how do external mechanical cues alter intracellular signaling pathways to shift intercellular junction phenotypes and local barrier function?

Nanoporous materials are materials characterized by pore sizes in the sub-micrometer range (for reference a human hair is approximately 20 micrometers). They have many important applications in electrochemical energy storage, catalysis, ion separation and tissue engineering. In electrochemical cells, including batteries and supercapacitors, electrode pore structure is critical to achieving good transport of ions and electrons through the cell, thus enabling higher energy and power densities. While numerous methods exist for synthesizing electrodes with controlled pore structures, there is a critical need to find new approaches for fabricating templated, nanoporous materials that are compatible with the high-throughput, roll-to-roll manufacturing processes currently employed in industries such as battery production. This project explores a new porous material manufacturing approach that uses nanoscale bubble templates in place of traditional hard templating materials, thus enabling precise control over the resulting porous structure while eliminating process complexities and waste associated with removal of the hard-templating material. The research is integrated with an educational plan that supports the training of graduate and undergraduate student researchers, enhances educational opportunities in the field of nanomanufacturing, and creates new opportunities for underrepresented minority groups in STEM, with a focus on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that nanosized bubbles can be used as templates to fabricate meso- and macroporous materials, and that the pore structures of these materials can be precisely engineered by controlling the size distribution and position of the bubbles during the templating process. The research addresses the follow key question: Can nanoscale bubbles be used to controllably template porous structures across micro-to-millimeter thick films at manufacturing rates compatible with meter-per-second scale (i.e. roll-to-roll) processing? The research addresses gaps in current knowledge of nanobubbles, including: i) mechanisms of solid film formation at nanobubble three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) interfaces; ii) the physics of nanobubble generation and stability, and iii) the precision with which nanobubble positions can be manipulated using methods such as acoustic standing waves. The research also tests new methods for real-time investigations of nanobubbles using in-situ liquid scanning transmission electron microscopy to advance fundamental knowledge of nanobubble interfaces and stability. Overall, the research and education plans establish the PI?s long-term career in advanced manufacturing of nanoscale materials for electrochemical energy storage and other applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seismic isolation systems, such as rolling isolation platforms, are a viable means of protecting individual components or groups of equipment within such facilities.

Both are hydrocarbon chain molecules -- varieties of ""polyethylene"".  The key difference is that the material used in hip replacements (along with other varieties of polyethylene used in durable gas and water pipes) contains molecular chains which are long enough to span between the microscopic crystals of the material, creating ?tie chains? that hold the material together.  While this example shows clearly that polymers need to be above a certain chain length to possess toughness and ductility, surprisingly it is not known ""how long is long enough?"" -- a threshold which also depends on microstructural features of the material, such as the distance separating those microscopic crystals.  This project will establish quantitative criteria for ductility in semicrystalline polymers, by synthesizing polymers of tightly-controlled chain length and molecular structure, and will also investigate how these tie molecules change shape when the material deforms.  These quantitative criteria will aid the design and processing of optimized semicrystalline polymers (of which polyethylene is just one example): e.g., where the polymer chains are long enough that the material does not fracture or fragment during use, but short enough that the material can be processed using a minimum of energy.  The project will provide an integrated research and educational experience for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students, including members of underrepresented groups.  The principal investigator and students will also engage the general public through science outreach at broadly-advertised events, both on campus and off.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Semicrystalline polymers derive their ductility and toughness from tie chains:  molecules sufficiently long that they can bridge two or more crystals.  Despite this qualitative understanding, today we do not know a priori the minimum macromolecular size needed to impart ductility to a semicrystalline polymer, even if all aspects of its solid-state structure (such as the crystallite and amorphous layer thicknesses) are known.  This project will use recently-developed ring-opening metathesis polymerization routes to synthesize well-defined semicrystalline homopolymers, statistical copolymers, and block copolymers, based on linear polyethylene and hydrogenated polynorbornene.  In one thrust, examination of linear homopolymers by small-angle neutron scattering will allow an assessment of the macromolecular (single-chain) deformation which occurs in tie chains beyond the yield point.  In a second thrust, systematic examination of homopolymers and statistical copolymers as molecular weight and noncrystallizable comonomer content are tuned will allow us to elucidate the structural features required for ductility.  Finally, we will build on this knowledge to simultaneously raise these polymers' yield strengths into the range of structural (engineering) plastics via incorporation of a short glassy block, while retaining ductility. Students will work  across all phases of the project, from synthesis to characterization to property measurement, gaining a big-picture outlook which will serve them well as a future foundation.  Project participants will engage the general public at broadly-advertised public outreach events, with a focus on polymeric materials science and technology.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, traditional metal casting suffers from high scrap rates because it is still regarded as a process that is empirically designed and with high uncertainty even in controlled processing environments. Due to the nature of the two-dimensional geometry of pathways for the molten metal, turbulent flow traps air in the melt and causes defects in the solidified castings. This results in poor mechanical properties along with additional costs and energy to repair or scrap the castings. This project conducts fundamental research to enable new numerical models and computational capabilities to study the complex relationships between the three-dimensional geometry of the sand mold and reduction in defects in the sand castings. This research is complemented by an integrated educational and outreach program based on new course development to be strategically deployed across the U.S through a network of foundry educators. In addition, a manufacturing education center at the home institution is leveraged for underrepresented minority and K-12 student outreach. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the effects of 3D freeform gating and riser geometry in sand casting on reducing defects and improving the mechanical properties of metal castings. Turbulent filling of molten metal results in the formation of oxide bifilms, air entrapment and porosity in castings, which adversely impact their mechanical performance. The research objectives of the project are: (1) Understand the effects of 3D free-form gating and riser design on air entrapment and formation of oxide bifilms during mold filling, and (2) Characterize the relationship between 3D freeform gating and riser system and solidification behavior and their impact on mechanical strength. This project leverages an additive manufacturing process, namely binder-jetting of foundry sand or 3D sand-printing for the fabrication of sand molds for metal casting. This research establishes a fundamental understanding of 3D gating and riser design geometries in sand molds for defect-free metal castings. Melt flow velocity, fluid dynamics, solidification rate, and microscopic properties such as dendrite arm spacing, inclusions and porosity are investigated. Design principles for 3D gating and riser geometries that can be achieved by 3D sand-printing of molds are developed and validated. This project enables the PI to advance the knowledge of metal casting science, computational fluid dynamics modeling and in-process monitoring of the casting process and establishes the foundation for a long-term career in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, changes in climate or tectonics can be recorded in subtle topographic variations. For example, where tectonic faults cross rivers, changes in fault movement can lead to waterfall formation.  These waterfalls can remain in landscapes for thousands to millions of years, allowing geologists to use the presence and position of waterfalls to infer past changes in Earth history. However, recent work has suggested that waterfalls may also spontaneously self-form, even when climate and tectonic forcing remains constant. Therefore, using waterfalls to ?read? Earth history from landscapes requires distinguishing self-formed waterfalls from those that form following changes in climate or tectonics. This project seeks to distinguish such waterfalls, thereby fundamentally improving our ability to decipher past changes in Earth history. Beyond this scientific advance, the project will promote public interest in the Earth sciences via harnessing the awe of waterfalls to engage in community outreach through the creation of online videos and K12 classroom visits focused on mountain stream hazards and waterfall formation. The project will also support the PhD and masters project of two female early-career scientists, as well as provide training for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanisms by which waterfalls can self-form (or form autogenically), as well as the morphology and erosion rates of self-formed waterfalls. This will be accomplished through a mix of laboratory experiments, field work, and modeling. Laboratory flume experiments will test the conditions under which autogenic waterfalls form, and these results will be compared to existing theory for the development of bedrock steps as well as a large database of putative autogenic waterfalls that will be collected as part of the project. The lab and field work will allow development of quantitative, non-dimensional metrics to identify autogenic waterfalls in the field, and will allow assessment of the ubiquity of autogenic waterfalls in nature. Finally, these results will be applied to develop a river long profile evolution model that accounts for autogenic waterfall formation and retreat, and can be used to predict the coupled response of landscapes to autogenic dynamics and external perturbations. This project thus fills a fundamental knowledge gap on how autogenic processes modify bedrock landscapes, thereby enhancing our ability to ?read? the record of Earth history recorded in topography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A distinctive feature of this project is its application of ecological theory to examine why science or math teachers in the state of Connecticut decide to remain in or to leave their teaching position.  The project will also use innovative statistical analyses to identify factors from the individual classroom to the entire school system that affect the teachers? decisions. The research will be based on data from local, state, and federal educational agencies, together with qualitative information collected within specific settings. This research has the potential to improve understandings and explanations of STEM teacher retention and loss. In addition, the statistical modeling approaches and associated analyses could be transferable for similar investigations in other settings.<br/><br/>This research project at University of Connecticut has three goals. First, the project is designed to produce quantitative analyses that may result in an empirically informed typology of secondary schools. This goal will result in a more nuanced mechanism for categorizing schools than simply relying on the percentage of low-income students to classify a school as high-need or not. Second, the project aims to identify factors at the classroom, department, and/or school level that are associated with science and math teacher attrition. More detailed and multi-level explanations could enable educational leaders to make more informed choices about strategies for retaining STEM teachers. The final research goal is to assess whether a congruence in views about educational equity between school administrators and STEM teachers is associated with retention and attrition. In addition to statistical modeling and analytic processes arising from this research, the project will communicate findings to school leaders and district administrators to inform their efforts to enhance STEM teacher retention.

Specifically, this work will measure how these cells respond to mechanical stimuli generated by ultrasound, and will also investigate if ultrasound can be strategically used to promote normal cell functions. Endothelial cells form the inner lining of arteries and are constantly exposed to mechanical stimuli from blood flow and pressure. Blood flow has been shown to be a key regulator of normal endothelial cell functions. The more turbulent the blood flow, the more function is impaired.  When the function of these cells is impaired, the artery is primed to develop diseases including heart disease. The knowledge gained about endothelial cells and their response to specific uses of ultrasound may someday lead to a novel therapy to prevent, or even reverse, diseases.

K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students will learn how engineering concepts can be used to solve problems in medicine. Dissemination of these learning modules at the K-12 level will be facilitated by collaborations with the Engineering Ambassadors Network and Nebraska 4-H.

At each level of the educational and career pipeline (e.g. student, postdoctoral, faculty), underrepresentation becomes more severe. At the most advanced levels of the academic ranks, the postdoctoral and faculty levels, the number of positions in the US has increased substantially over the past two decades, providing a window of opportunity for diversification of the professoriate.  While the number of URM PhD recipients has grown, the URG share of faculty positions in these fields has increased only modestly, particularly at the nation?s research universities. If one important focus of diversity efforts at research universities is to place URG scholars into the professoriate, these scholars need to do more than complete their Ph.D. programs ? they must stand out in terms of the ?gold standard? by which prospective applicants for postdoctoral and faculty jobs are judged: their publication record. A candidate?s publication record is the most important criterion for potential employment in most four-year and almost all research universities, and is a measure of success in the academy, including for promotions to tenure.  This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of California, Berkeley, will address disparities in outcomes, including publication records, for URM doctoral students, while improving the graduate education experience for all students. <br/><br/>The Identity, Structure and Belonging (ISB) project will tackle the persistent problem of underrepresentation not at the level of individual faculty or student perceptions, actions, or interactions, but rather, at the level of the organizational structure of graduate programs. IGE-ISB will use a mixed methods research approach that begins with synthesis of existing data, followed by extensive qualitative data collection (participant-driven semi-structured interviews), rigorous analysis, development of a ?blueprint? describing how features of graduate programs work to create equitable career outcomes; and a quantitative self-assessment tool (a Likert-type questionnaire) by which departments and universities can assess their graduate program design. IGE-ISB will address this key research question: What are the underlying graduate program structures reflected in everyday practices and routine day-to-day ways of doing things in doctoral programs that produce equitable outcomes for their students? How might departments alter their structures to establish processes, procedures, and climate that are effective at preparing all, equitably, for the full array of careers that lead from a PhD education, including academic careers? What are the specific methods by which departments establish clarity of expectations and a sense of belonging at critical stages of the doctoral programs to enhance equitable outcomes? IGE-ISB will develop a blueprint of graduate program features that lead to equitable career outcomes for students, one that is pragmatic and applicable across departments, and that can be applied at a national scale. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Unique physicochemical and electronic properties emerge as materials are engineered at the nanoscale. This project explores what would happen if the same material were engineered to be even smaller at the sub-nanoscale, even down to the ?single atom'. Single-atom catalysts are the theoretical limit of material downsizing and represent a frontier of materials research today. Single-atom catalysts are synthesized by tightly anchoring individual noble metal or transition metal atoms onto a support material. This configuration allows every atom to be available for catalytic reaction, unlike nanoparticles in which atoms are inevitably buried inside a cluster of atoms. Single-atom catalysts are is particularly attractive for costly noble metal catalysts, such as palladium, that are often sought in reductive pollutant degradation processes for environmental remediation.  This research project seeks to examine how palladium can be controlled at the atomic scale to best exploit the material?s catalytic properties in an application relevant to water treatment. Successful completion of this project will enable more cost-effective and more sustainable environmental remediation solutions. The project will leverage an outreach program that the investigator has established to engage local high school students in STEM research. The investigator will also offer classes to high school teachers. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to evaluate how palladium catalysts behave differently when downsized from nanoparticles to the single atom limit. Palladium single-atom catalyst material properties will be correlated with synthetic parameters by employing various advanced characterization techniques such as high energy X-ray absorption and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Other properties, including atomic dispersion, local coordination environment, and oxidation state of the active metal site, will be further correlated to catalytic performance for the reductive removal of toxic halogenated organic compounds and nitrate (and potentially other oxyanions, such as nitrite, bromate, chromate, and perchlorate) that pose significant environmental and human health concerns. In addition, the PI will investigate how palladium single-atom catalysts behave differently from their nanoparticle counterparts over long-term use and under a complex water matrix to evaluate their environmental fate. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this project will gain interdisciplinary knowledge, particularly at the interface of materials science, advanced spectroscopy, and environmental engineering.

However, the reasons why surface elevations in this region increased are not well understood. This project will investigate the viability of one of several proposed mechanisms that have generated considerable debate over the last several decades. Specifically, this research will address whether hydration of Earth?s crust by water derived from a subducted fragment of the Pacific oceanic plate reduced its density and caused the ground surface to rise. This is based on the same principles that govern how high blocks of wood with different densities will float in water. The results of this research could have far-reaching implications because causal mechanisms for high elevations in the broader Rocky Mountain region and High Plains (including Denver, the ?Mile High City?) may be due to processes that also affect other mountainous regions such as the Andes. Common educational themes among all of the activities in this project include graduate and undergraduate education and training, international collaborations with researchers in France, and enhancement of underrepresented minority students in Earth science.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the hypothesis that hydrous alteration changed the mineralogical makeup and associated density structure of the Colorado Plateau lower crust and contributed significantly to its 2 kilometers surface uplift via isostatic adjustment. This research will integrate new petrologic, geochronologic, and stable hydrogen isotopic studies of a suite of crustal xenoliths from the approximately 25-million-year-old Navajo Volcanic Field. A post-hydration (present-day) model of the central Colorado Plateau crust will be developed that incorporates new observations from xenoliths, and ensures compatibility with modern seismic and other geophysical data. This will be evaluated along with a pre-hydration model for the crust that is based on detailed xenolith analyses.

This dependence on grasses has deep roots.  Humans and their ancestors evolved in concert with grassland ecosystems in Africa over the past 7 million years. Despite the well-documented association between human evolution and grasslands, little is known about the origin of grasses in Africa, especially before 10 million years ago.  When and how did grasses rise to ecological dominance?  Lack of knowledge on this subject is largely due to the sparse plant fossil record.  To understand how grasslands may have shaped the evolutionary trajectory of our species and other mammals, new, widely applicable approaches are needed to reconstruct ancient ecosystems. This project is developing new methods for reconstructing vegetation in past ecosystems using molecular plant fossils preserved in ancient sediments.  Combining these approaches with existing isotopic methods, the researcher is reconstructing the rise of grasslands in East Africa over the past ~25 million years and exploring the relationships between climate, ecosystem, and evolutionary change.  The results could produce new insights on the interconnectedness of climate, ecosystems and human evolution over geological timescales. A parallel objective throughout the project is to support students in their pursuit of STEM careers with an emphasis on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in the Earth sciences. The project includes intensive three-week field and lab courses for graduate students and postdocs from the US and African nations, lab-based research opportunities for undergraduate and New York City high school students, and support for a graduate student to conduct PhD research. <br/><br/>African terrestrial ecosystems underwent revolutionary change in the Neogene. Sparse paleobotanical evidence suggests that denser forested ecosystems gave way to more open forests, woodlands, and perhaps nascent grasslands near the end of the early Miocene to the middle Miocene. This same period (~19 to 13 Ma) was marked by major changes in the primate and large mammal communities, yet the paleoecological context remains poorly known.  By the late Miocene (10 Ma), carbon isotopic evidence shows that C4 grasslands began to spread. Despite the firm record of C4 grassland expansion beginning at 10 Ma, the role of ecological change in mammalian and human evolution through most of the Neogene has been insufficiently addressed. The Principal Investigator is developing organic geochemical approaches for reconstructing terrestrial ecosystem structure using modern ecosystems. This includes methods to estimate the fraction of woody cover from n-alkane molecular distributions and to measure grass abundance using PTMEs.  Modern ecosystem research will also yield carbon and hydrogen isotope enrichment factors between biomarkers, bulk plant tissue, and soils. The researcher is applying these methods to terrestrial and marine sedimentary records from the Neogene Period in Africa to determine when and how grasslands became ecologically significant and how ecosystem change may have affected faunal and human evolution. The project will incorporate postdocs and graduate, undergraduate, and high school students into research, training, and field work. This includes developing a three-week paleoecology short course in Kenya for graduate students and postdocs from US institutions and African nations. The Principal Investigator is also providing research opportunities in his lab, built on a tiered mentoring program, for high school and undergraduate students from New York City. This program has high participation rates of students from underrepresented groups and serves as a pipeline for first-generation college students, many of whom ultimately major in STEM fields. One graduate student will be trained and supported by this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coherence is a phenomenon resulting from the quantum nature of semiconductors that plays an important role in determining energy and charge migration pathways within these materials and thus influences device performance. However, the role of coherence in charge transfer remains underexplored. This project is investigating how coherences involving molecular vibrations assist charge generation following light absorption by organic semiconductors. The graduate student participants in this project are being educated using an integrated approach that trains them to be problem solvers. The students are being taught to prepare complex materials and at the same time are learning the physical techniques necessary to answer the questions addressed by their research. This approach is very effective in developing the kind of intellectual flexibility necessary to meet the rapidly changing roles of scientists in society. This project also engages the broader community through outreach to elementary schools through to the collegiate level to educate and inspire the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Organic semiconductors suitable for photonic device applications must be designed for ultrafast photo-driven electron-hole pair formation and subsequent rapid charge transport over long distances. Many such materials are based on electron donor-acceptor molecular components, such that optimizing the performance of organic semiconductors requires a fundamental understanding of the microscopic aspects of charge transfer in donor-acceptor systems at the quantum mechanical level. The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether vibrational and/or vibronic coherences assist symmetry-breaking charge generation following photoexcitation of organic semiconductors. The secondary goals of the project are to investigate 1) whether higher-order polygonal structures in solids, i.e. tilings and tessellations, lead to coherences that assist charge separation in organic semiconductors, and 2) whether excitonic coherences resulting from energy transfer processes in organic semiconductors influence subsequent charge transfer within them. While charge transfer is inherently quantum mechanical, many of the salient features of electron transfer kinetics have been treated classically. However, these treatments largely ignore the role of quantum coherences between states as they are typically very short lived (~10-100 fs for electronic states, up to several ps for vibrational/vibronic states) and as such are assumed to have decayed prior to electron transfer. However, with increasingly advanced spectroscopic techniques and improvements in time resolution, it is now possible to probe these processes on the requisite timescales and observe these coherences and their effects directly, which will aid in the design of high-performance organic semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer glasses are used in applications as diverse as advanced aircraft composites and eyeglass lenses. The planned research will investigate how polymer glasses respond when they are subjected to large forces. In particular, the experiments will use lasers and microscopes to measure how the polymer molecules rearrange when a polymer glass is deformed. Current theories and computer simulations have identified this molecular motion as a key quantity that must be understood to determine if a polymer glass will stretch, deform, or break. The polymer glasses to be used will be processed in special ways (stretched at high temperature or deformed at low temperature) to critically test these simulations and theories. The proposed experiments should lead to more reliable models for the prediction of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses.  This in turn may have a significant economic impact because of the broad potential of these lightweight materials.  The students involved in this project will learn how to characterize polymer glasses and improve the properties of materials.

Here it is proposed to measure segmental mobility in polymer glasses during deformation using an optical photobleaching method that provides access to the rotational correlation function of an ensemble of dilute probe molecules.  Deformation can increase segmental mobility in polymer glasses by more than a factor of 1000, and an understanding of this enhanced mobility is a key requirement for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. For the proposed work, polymer glasses will be prepared by melt quenching so that subsequent mobility measurements during deformation can disentangle the influences of yield and strain hardening on segmental mobility. The proposed work will also test whether deformed polymer glasses can show indications of overaging, i.e., physical aging that occurs at an accelerated rate as a result of applied stress.  Finally, the generality of the results obtained in tensile deformation will be tested by performing optical measurements of segmental mobility during shear deformation. The proposed experiments can provide a molecular-level test of theoretical descriptions of polymer glass deformation. The experimental results obtained, in comparison with theory and simulation, should lead to an enhanced fundamental understanding of the deformation of polymer glasses.

The goal of this project is to understand and improve the neural network technology that underlies these applications. A neural network is an artificial intelligence system that is trained to behave in a certain way by showing it many examples of how it should behave. While neural networks are the best way currently known for building natural language applications, they have a major drawback: Once they appear to have learned how to do some natural language task, we don?t know exactly what they have learned, and consequently we can?t be certain how they will act in all circumstances. In order to improve this technology to be more robust, and also to make it more comprehensible and controllable, we need to develop ways of determining exactly what patterns a neural network has learned once it has been trained. In this project, methods from experimental psychology are adapted and used to reveal the inner workings of neural network systems that have been trained to perform natural language tasks. <br/><br/>This research focuses on determining how well neural networks that are trained to do natural language processing (NLP) tasks have learned representations of the syntactic structure of natural language: the grammatical relationships among words in sentences. It does so by adopting the recently proposed ?machine behavior? approach in which neural networks are studied by subjecting them to behavioral tests. The project as a whole has three major components. The first is to develop and train a large reference set of neural network NLP systems that vary in their architecture; all subsequent experiments are to be carried out on all of these models, so that they can be ranked in terms of the quality of their representations of syntactic structure. The second is to carry out a number of behavioral tests, by constructing carefully crafted sentences designed to elicit certain responses from the neural networks. The third is to analyze the actual information inside of the neural networks using structural probing, a newly developed technique, in order to detect representations of syntactic structure directly. The results of this research can be useful for guiding future NLP research in the development of more comprehensible neural network systems for natural language applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This region was at sea level 100 million years ago and now sits at an elevation of about 2 kilometers above sea level. However, the reasons why surface elevations in this region increased are not well understood. This project will investigate the viability of one of several proposed mechanisms that have generated considerable debate over the last several decades. Specifically, this research will address whether hydration of Earth?s crust by water derived from a subducted fragment of the Pacific oceanic plate reduced its density and caused the ground surface to rise. This is based on the same principles that govern how high blocks of wood with different densities will float in water. The results of this research could have far-reaching implications because causal mechanisms for high elevations in the broader Rocky Mountain region and High Plains (including Denver, the ?Mile High City?) may be due to processes that also affect other mountainous regions such as the Andes. Common educational themes among all of the activities in this project include graduate and undergraduate education and training, international collaborations with researchers in France, and enhancement of underrepresented minority students in Earth science.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the hypothesis that hydrous alteration changed the mineralogical makeup and associated density structure of the Colorado Plateau lower crust and contributed significantly to its 2 kilometers surface uplift via isostatic adjustment. This research will integrate new petrologic, geochronologic, and stable hydrogen isotopic studies of a suite of crustal xenoliths from the approximately 25-million-year-old Navajo Volcanic Field. A post-hydration (present-day) model of the central Colorado Plateau crust will be developed that incorporates new observations from xenoliths, and ensures compatibility with modern seismic and other geophysical data. This will be evaluated along with a pre-hydration model for the crust that is based on detailed xenolith analyses. Calculated differences in pre-and post-hydration model densities will be used to constrain the potential isostatic response to alteration.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Tectonics program and the Petrology & Geochemistry program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since 2004, Maryland has had a statewide teacher shortage in mathematics and science. The need for mathematics and science teachers is persistently critical in Prince George?s County Public Schools, with whom the project will work. More than ninety percent of the students in Prince George?s County Public Schools are underrepresented minorities. Research has shown that the success of children in school is positively affected by having same-race teachers. Bowie State University, a historically black institution within Prince George?s County, provides an ideal population from which to recruit and prepare highly skilled teachers who match the demographics of the school district. Through internship opportunities, academic scholarships, pedagogical training, and mentoring activities, this project seeks to attract, prepare, support, and retain talented underrepresented minority secondary teachers in Prince George?s County Public Schools and other Maryland high-need school districts.  <br/><br/>The project includes a partnership with Prince George?s County Public Schools, a high-need school district through achieving three main goals:  1. To support the recruitment and retention of undergraduate STEM majors into Math Education and Science Education programs. 2. To support career development of Noyce scholars committed to teaching in high-need schools. 3. To support success and retention of induction-phase Noyce scholar teachers. This project is modeled on social cognitive career theory, which posits that personal experiences shape and alter career interests. By providing students with meaningful teaching and mentorship opportunities, this project aims to recruit undergraduates majoring in biology and mathematics into teaching careers.  To support the success and retention of the Noyce scholars committed to teaching in high-need schools, the project plans continued support during the induction phase of teaching in Prince George?s County Public Schools. A supportive community of educational professionals will be developed through the engagement of Noyce Scholars in a mentoring network with master teachers. To develop teaching self-efficacy, Noyce Scholars will attend pedagogy seminars on culturally responsive educational approaches and career development. The Scholars will have opportunities to attend Praxis II prep workshops, perform action research projects in their yearlong practical classroom experience, attend conferences, and engage in educator networking opportunities. As part of the project?s recruitment and development efforts, a STEM communication club will be created to engage community members in science at public events.  For each of the first three years of funding, the project intends to offer 40 paid, semester-long tutoring internships in a Prince George?s County Public School and 18 paid summer internships in the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research?s GEMS program summer camp program. By the end of the award, the project intends to produce at least 23 new secondary teachers who are prepared to engage students in successful learning experiences in high school biology and mathematics. The project?s research and evaluation agenda will measure how program activities impact Scholars? self-efficacy and outcome expectancy toward choosing teaching as a career. Overall, this project intends to increase the number of underrepresented minority teachers who are well-prepared to teach in high-need schools.  It also aims to provide insights into successful methods for training and retaining underrepresented minorities in STEM teaching careers. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving this goal requires a shift towards more affordable materials, accessible fabrication strategies, and assistive design software that considers the particular dynamics of cost-efficient motors and materials, as well as the needs of specific applications. The results of this project will impact fields in which specialization is desirable, such as assistive robotics for the elderly, custom agricultural applications, and trash pickup in smart cities.

Additionally, it is becoming increasingly important to reproductively isolate plants growing in a field setting to prevent gene flow between transgenic and non-transgenic variants.  The Wallace lab has recently demonstrated that a group of proteins called Protein O-FucosylTransferases (POFTs), which attach sugars onto target proteins to regulate their behavior, play a role in this plant reproduction process.  The Wallace lab will use advanced biochemical and genetic methods to dissect the contribution of POFTs in plant reproduction and identify the proteins that are being regulated by these enzymes to elucidate how POFTs contribute to plant reproduction and how these enzymes could be manipulated to optimize this process.  Additionally, this project will support the research training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students from diverse and under-represented backgrounds.  This project will also support the development of web-based video protocols that communicate the advanced methods used to approach this research in a freely available manner. <br/><br/>The long-term goal is to mechanistically understand the enzymes that catalyze protein O-fucosylation, their protein targets, and the extent of this modification in plant systems.  The central hypothesis guiding this research is that POFTs fucosylate target proteins that govern cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis, cell adhesion, and cell-cell communication in plants.  Specific Aim 1 seeks to understand the enzymology and sugar nucleotide substrate specificity of Arabidopsis putative POFTs by employing sugar nucleotide hydrolysis assays to understand which sugar nucleotides are substrates for putative POFTs.

Multifunctional yarns and textiles incorporate active material microfibers in their structure to provide actuation, sensing, energy harvesting, or communication, potentially revolutionizing medical devices, rehabilitation equipment, and wearable technologies to deliver life-saving and life-enhancing interventions. Shape memory alloys are a particularly promising material system for multifunctional yarns and textiles because they directly afford actuation through the shape memory effect and energy absorption through the superelastic effect. It is hypothesized that the performance of the yarns and textiles are a function of the material composition, heat treatment, and processing parameters. This research seeks to understand the interrelationships between processing, structure and properties, predict the performance of the yarns and textiles through the creation of modeling capabilities, and develop a manufacturing strategy to produce and implement multifunctional textiles with tailorable mechanical performance. The research advances are integrated into outreach, mentoring, artistic and coursework activities to increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and female students, grow the community of STEM literate citizens, and develop the next generation of researchers and educators.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to understand the effects of material, yarn, and textile processing on the properties and performance of shape memory alloy (SMA) yarns and textiles.

For instance, hospital patients who were prescribed antibiotics also tend to suffer from opportunistic infections, though we don?t expect antibiotics to cause infections. The likely explanation in this case is that an early presence of an infectious agent caused the latter infection, and the doctor prescribing antibiotics.  A key obstacle to finding valid cause-effect relationships from data is the presence of hidden but causally relevant variables, like the infectious agent above. This project aims to develop new methods for drawing valid causal inferences in datasets with hidden variables while avoiding known pitfalls of existing approaches. Aside from its role in data analysis, causal literacy is an important skill for making informed choices as citizens and consumers.  The investigator aims to promote this skill by incorporating causal methods into existing data science courses at Johns Hopkins University, developing a new course that will teach methods for detecting misunderstandings of causal claims, and developing a tutorial aimed at bridging the gap between machine learning and statistics in discussing and working on causal inference.<br/><br/>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an elegant method for reasoning about fully observed causal systems.  The proposed research aims to provide a new formalism for causal systems with hidden variables that retains the advantages of DAGs, while dispensing with the disadvantages of representing hidden variables directly.  This formalism captures all equality constraints in the observed marginal distribution via a regular model of a mixed graph.  Success in the proposed research will significantly advance understanding of all major tasks in causal systems with hidden variables: identification, estimation, and computationally efficient probabilistic calculations.

Unfortunately, there are numerous obstacles in contemporary scientific research that preclude universal reproducibility. These range from key omissions or vague instructions in the experimental description to journals that require subscriptions and thus restrict access to the entire scientific product.  Open Science is an approach to conducting reproducible research, but its practices are difficult and time-consuming to adopt. The National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to University of Georgia will pilot an educational program that teams up students and faculty conducting research, with the ultimate goal of lowering barriers to conducting Open Science and catalyzing an institutional shift toward an open and transparent approach to science. The project will incentivize Open Science practices in research and education and will provide additional training opportunities to students and faculty alike to obtain skills in Open Science that are otherwise not offered in a contemporary research setting. This project will establish new curricula, creating new opportunities for future students and faculty as well as endowing them with skills that are highly sought in a variety of fields. <br/><br/>Recent surveys reveal a pervasive belief that there is a broad reproducibility crisis in science. Examples abound across disciplines: seminal studies have been, upon later scrutiny and attempts to replicate, revealed as irreproducible. Open Science offers a principled, albeit abstract, approach to scientific research that emphasizes openness and reproducibility. Most scientists agree reproducibility must be addressed. Yet, the adoption of open practices has remained anemic, as the culture surrounding research has not been sufficiently incentivized to change, nor has the practice of Open Science been defined as a concrete process. This 3-year project aims to study how to catalyze a cultural shift in the research and educational practices at the University of Georgia. Critically, the approach is process-oriented and bidirectional: students will be recruited at varying stages of their graduate careers as the experimental cohort, and a peer support structure will be established among them. Faculty will also be recruited: supervisors of participating graduate students and experts in Open Science and institutional change. These students and faculty, representing a variety of STEM disciplines, will participate in a series of workshops to obtain a formal understanding of Open Science. Participating faculty will sustain this curriculum through their own Open Science training with external experts, course modifications, and an interdisciplinary graduate certificate program formalizing the coursework and standards for training in Open Science principles and practices. This will establish a network of influencers to effect broad institutional change, further facilitating a cultural shift toward adoption of Open Science. <br/><br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

This study investigates a widely used tool which relates grain size of rock samples to stress levels by conducting a series of experiments in which rocks are cooled as they are deformed, mimicking the cooling of natural rocks as they are carried by faults towards Earth?s surface. The project explores the possibility that the statistics of grain size distributions in such samples can be used to extract useful information about the stress and deformation history of such rocks. The project is advancing desired societal outcomes through: (1) improved understanding of processes involved in earthquakes; (2) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); and (3) the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the Earth sciences and support of two early career scientists.<br/><br/>The recrystallized grain size of rocks deformed in the middle crust is routinely used to constrain differential stress magnitudes and rock rheology. Such ?grain size piezometry? requires an assumption of microstructural steady state, however most exposed ductile shear zones experienced deformation while cooling. Cooling causes an increase in rock strength, and as a result, a stable recrystallized grain size is a moving target. Recent rock deformation experiments demonstrate that, at ratios of cooling rate to strain rate equivalent to those of typical natural shear zones, recrystallized grain size is markedly out of equilibrium?recrystallized grain sizes are twice as large as would occur if a steady-state were achieved. This result motivates the primary goals of this proposal: 1) determine robust criteria for recognizing microstructures that are affected by cooling during deformation, and 2) develop a toolkit for constraining stress histories from such rocks. Preliminary work on goal one demonstrates that there are systematic differences in the shapes of grain size distributions of cooling ramp experiments versus experiments at constant temperature. A suite of Griggs Rig, general-shear cooling-ramp experiments over a 500C range of temperature are conducted. These experiments will--in conjunction with Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) scanning electron microscopy data from well-constrained natural samples and archival experiments carried out at constant temperature?explore extrapolation of laboratory results to low temperature geologic conditions, and potential effects of strain, initial grain size, and the presence of porphyroclasts and secondary phases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A number of processes have been proposed for this so-called Arctic polar amplification. While sea ice is known to play an important role on reflecting solar radiation and altering the Earth?s surface temperature, the roles of other processes are difficult to quantify. Especially, contributions from atmospheric mechanisms associated with ice-nucleating particles (INP; a few in a million aerosol particles below -20 C) and ice-involved clouds remain uncertain in the Arctic. This project aims to fill the gap by investigating the sources (natural/manmade), atmospheric abundance/budget, chemical composition and physical properties of INPs in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Moreover, the large measurement uncertainties in number concentrations, chemical composition and sources of INPs are problematic for modeling real-life phenomena. This research targets minimizing the measurement uncertainties and addresses this critical deficiency through a series of studies that involve direct collection of ice-nucleating particles and their residuals. To characterize Arctic ice-nucleating particles, a novel portable ice nucleation experiment chamber and a cold stage-supported droplet freezing assay will be used to obtain freezing temperature spectra of airborne particle samples. A new inertial ice particle separation technique will be used to collect ice crystal residuals relevant to the Arctic ice-involved clouds. The subsequent offline microspectroscopic characterization of ice crystal residuals and ambient aerosol particles will reveal the relative importance of aerosol physicochemical properties to particle size in ice nucleation. Ultimately, the measurements of INPs and ice crystal residuals from this research will be parameterized and translated to describe the time-resolved freezing ability of the particles as a function of temperature, their composition, water activity parameters and other physicochemical properties. Finally, an integration of research and education is the most important target of this project. This project will involve two graduate and several undergraduate students in research, curriculum development and outreach, as these are learning experiences that can aid in their professional development. This project will also develop hands-on curricular modules integrated with the proposed research to teach environmental and climate science to the general public, promote college courses and train future scientists.<br/><br/>Currently, there is a critical deficiency in Arctic field data regarding the abundance and composition of atmospheric ice-nucleating particles at temperatures above -15 C. This project will fill this gap by experimentally elucidating abundance and physicochemical properties of ice-nucleating particles. State-of-the-art representations of high-temperature INPs from the Atlantic sector of the Arctic will advance the atmospheric modeling community?s knowledge of the ice nucleation processes and its formulation in the Earth?s energy balance. The project also aims to provide robust and well-characterized INP measurements that will be archived in the publicly available university database. The measurements from this project, in collaboration with the existing transnational Arctic research community, will improve the understanding of the nature of aerosols, and the INP parameterizations representative of the Ny-lesund site will dramatically improve the understanding of ice formation processes that are currently very poorly represented in climate models. In addition, this research activity directly aligns with one of the NSF?s 10 priority research areas, ?Navigating the New Arctic?.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Visual reasoning enables people to translate visual input to abstract concepts. For example, to interpret which counties will receive more snowfall using a weather map, it is necessary to figure out which colors on the weather map indicate which amounts of snowfall. People have expectations about how visual features should map to concepts in visualizations, and it is harder for them to interpret visualizations that violate those expectations, even if mappings are clearly labeled. However, the nature of those expectations and their role in visual reasoning is not well-understood, so the design of information visualizations is often unprincipled and ad-hoc. With a better understanding of how visual reasoning works, it will be possible to design visualizations that fit its strengths and optimize visual communication. The investigators will address this problem by studying how people infer meaning from color in visualizations. This research can be translated to producing online tools for designing visualizations, which will improve STEM education and increase public literacy and engagement with science and technology. The education plan will use visual communication to make science more accessible and engaging through virtual reality (VR) and accompanying hands-on experiences with color and visualization, for both college undergraduates and middle-school students. The investigators will also support broadening participation of females in STEM through mentoring among the PI, graduate student, undergraduate intern, and middle school girls. <br/><br/>The proposed research will address fundamental questions about how visual reasoning enables visual communication. In Objective 1, the investigators will study how people learn to associate perceptual features with novel concepts through environmental statistics. They will also examine how learned associations extend beyond perceptual input due to categorical structure in cognitive representations. In Objective 2, the team will study how to automatically estimate color?concept associations from image statistics. They will construct and evaluate new models that incorporate predictors based on visual input and cognitive representations of color categories. In the process of constructing these models, the team will develop new methods for quantifying graded category membership in a continuous space. By modeling human judgments, there is potential to develop new insights into how those judgments are made. In Objective 3, the team will investigate how people use color?concept associations to interpret visualizations, in a process called assignment inference. Assignment inference enables people to infer optimal mappings between colors and concepts in visualizations, but little is known about how this process works. It is proposed that it can be understood using accumulator models typically used in decision making research, which will forge new connections between the fields of decision making and information visualization. The results will increase knowledge of how people integrate information from multiple, conflicting sources and provide new knowledge about how to optimally design semantically interpretable visualizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A VR station will be set up which is capable of tracking multimodal body data such as gaze, body pose, hand movement, and the locomotion of a trainee in performing tasks in a virtual workplace. Based on such tracked data, machine learning models are trained to analyze and characterize the trainee?s skill levels. (2) How to synthesize virtual environments for personalized training? Optimization approaches will be formulated for synthesizing realistic and highly immersive virtual environments for adaptively training the trainee considering his/her skill levels, preferences, and personal training goals.

Generally speaking, the idea is that one can study a mathematical object: a variety, a representation, or an L-function, by deforming it in families. A family is a set of global objects that share some common local features. Mathematicians predict that families have equidistribution properties in the sense that their local components should vary in a uniform way within their prescribed space. Building proofs of such properties is a milestone in our mathematical ability to work with these objects. Additionally this project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Families are crucial even if one is a priori interested in a single automorphic form. Arthur conjectured in 1988 that if an automorphic representation has a local component that belongs to a supercuspidal L-packet, then it is tempered. Over function fields, the PI proposes to establish with Sawin this conjecture for monomial geometric supercuspidal (mgs) packets, that is for those packets that arise from compact-induction of characters and remain supercuspidal after unramified base change. The method relies on combining the l-adic geometry of the moduli space of G-bundles on a curve and on trace formulas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With growing global trends in increased complexity of engineering systems and their prolonged service lives, staged deployment and co-evolution have become an economic option for the development of such large-scale systems. Deploying the system progressively in stages, starting from affordable stages, enhances flexibility and mitigates potential risks against an unknown and evolving future. A broad range of industries (e.g., public infrastructure, healthcare, aerospace, and defense) suffer from high development costs and large operational uncertainties in the deployment of these systems, however. There is an imperative need for a rigorous built-in flexibility design methodology to optimize and coordinate the flexible subsystem-level design and co-deployment that ensure system-level performance; this problem is extremely challenging due to its prohibitive computational complexity. How can engineers design a flexible complex system with coupled subsystems and its staged deployment plan in a rigorous and scalable way? This program seeks to answer this question in order to transform complex system design and enable systems to adapt effectively to future uncertainties. <br/><br/>The program will develop a novel scalable design framework and associated computational techniques for staged deployment optimization of flexible large-scale complex systems by efficiently handling operational uncertainties at the early design stage. The created local scenario discretization scheme offers a unique computationally efficient approach to manage staged co-deployment by decoupling weak dynamic interaction among subsystems. Moreover, the decomposition-based design method introduces an innovative bottom-up staged-deployment design, leading to a parallelizable and more scalable design approach than the traditional top-down approaches. The resulting unified flexible design optimization methodology will bridge the gap between high-level flexibility analysis and detailed-level design decisions. An integrated educational component of the project will directly impact STEM educational curriculum and K-12 outreach activity planning by applying the researched flexible staged-deployment concepts to transform the traditional fixed syllabus-based pedagogy into a flexible and modular one.

The societal impact of h-CPS, however, is contingent on ensuring safety and reliability. Several high-profile incidents have shown that unsafe h-CPS can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Formal methods enable the model-based design of safety-critical systems with mathematically rigorous guarantees. However, the research area of formal methods for h-CPS is still in its infancy. The goal of this research is to expand formal methods toward the joint modeling and formal analysis of CPS and human-autonomy interactions, accounting for the uncertainty and variability of human behaviors, intentions, and preferences. <br/><br/>The key innovations include new methods to build probabilistic models that can represent unobservable human cognitive states estimated from multi-modal sensing data, and to learn probabilistic specifications for h-CPS; as well as novel probabilistic verification and synthesis techniques to provide correctness guarantees for h-CPS and explainable results that help humans understand counterexamples and synthesized control strategies. If successful, this research will enable the rigorous model-based design of h-CPS such as self-driving cars, thereby contributing to improving safety and cutting development costs.

Due to the several types of loading that can induce failure, these problems span a broad spectrum of coupled physical phenomena, deformations, loading rates, and length scales, where physical testing is often limited and costly. Current computational methods provide viable means but have their limitations in accurately and robustly performing failure simulations across all considerations. This research will innovate by developing novel algorithms that overcome these limitations by combining the advantages offered by existing computational techniques. Consequently, this research will allow investigations of dynamic fracture, complex three-dimensional failure modes, and damage initiation and propagation, thus accelerating the understanding of the science behind these events. Engineering applications of this work include mitigation of disasters and deterioration of infrastructure, and advances in diverse areas such as additive manufacturing, tool wear, and biomechanics. The educational portion of this program will develop open courses that will aid in learning the fundamentals of the knowledge and disseminating the results. The learning material and research will be integrated with an outreach program for underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, to recruit, retain, and train the next generation of engineers in simulation-based analysis.<br/><br/>Effective approaches for simulating three-dimensional complex fracture has been a long-standing challenge. To overcome this challenge, the main objective of this research is to achieve a unification of the local classical reproducing kernel meshfree method and the nonlocal peridynamics method, to form the hybrid reproducing kernel peridynamics (RKPD) framework. This unification is intended to enhance several critical features in the non-local approach, necessary for effective numerical analysis of complex failure problems across a wide range of deformations and deformation rates: high accuracy and optimal convergence, ease of integration of multiple physical processes, high-order accurate shock wave propagation, and contact mechanics. The framework will be tested and validated against data obtained from experiments on a nanosilica reinforced epoxy composite, possessing a complex microstructure. Moreover, these computational developments will be incorporated into an open-source software that will be freely available to the science and engineering communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, the investigator will develop new machine learning algorithms to better detect authenticity and recommend content. The research integrates computer and social sciences to account for the complex real-world interactions among publisher, platform, content recommendation algorithms, bot users, human users, and their social connections. One way social networks engage users is by keeping them consuming personalized content. Malicious actors can easily penetrate these systems with misleading stories and consequent recommendations that prompt people to make decisions based on this misinformation. Younger generations are increasingly active on such platforms, making it critical to reduce the threat that the continuing spread of misinformation poses. Findings will result in a deeper understanding of how recommender systems behave in the presence of misleading stories, and will offer systems design strategies to insure that people receive accurate information to make decisions.<br/><br/>There is currently no framework in place to quantify how much recommendations with misinformation in the loop influence social network users. This research will fill this gap. Project objectives are to: (1) develop graph-based models to measure the degree of story, sources, and user credibility as opposed to a typical binary assessment; (2) develop a new framework integrating user-centric information diffusion models to assess the impact of, and compute benchmarks for, current recommender systems in spreading misleading stories; (3) develop algorithms for content recommender systems that will minimize misinformation spread in social networks. An integrated education plan will engage Boise State University college students, who will use a service-learning approach to help Idaho high school students and teachers improve their ability to identify and respond to misinformation.

Thus, increasing the quality of mathematics teaching is a critical need for broadening participation in STEM and increasing the nation's competitiveness in the global economy. This project will focus on master mathematics teachers in high-need school districts in the greater Boston area. It will connect mathematicians, mathematics educators, teachers, and mentor experts to create a professional community focused on mathematics content, equitable teaching and learning approaches, and teacher leadership development. As a part of the project, a broad group of mathematics teachers will systematically learn mentorship and leadership skills. These teachers will then draw on their leadership skills to improve professional development in their schools and districts.  <br/><br/>This project at Boston College includes partnerships with the Boston and Revere Public Schools and with the Education Development Center, a global nonprofit with a focus on innovation in education curriculum and resources for students, teachers, and practitioners. The project will offer a comprehensive, five-year program of professional leadership development for 14 exemplary Master Teaching Fellows, within two cohorts of seven teachers each. These teachers will be prepared to assume leadership roles in their schools and within the high-need school districts in which they teach. A tripartite approach will focus on developing mathematical expertise through engagement in authentic mathematical experiences, developing tools to promote equitable pedagogy and school outcomes, and on systematically developing mentorship and leadership skills. Project evaluation will include teachers' gains in content knowledge, use of equity-focused pedagogy, and broader impacts of the project activities. This project will serve as a model for combining disciplinary expertise with an understanding of the diverse U.S. classroom and with developing leadership, a combination of critical importance in preparing teachers for our nation's increasingly diverse classrooms.

In such an ecosystem, third-party developers can build new functions to offer additional services to the end-users for example, order food, manage bank accounts, and lock doors. These systems have already been deployed to households around the world and utilized by tens of millions of users.

This work focuses on addressing the security and privacy issues in voice-controlled platforms. The project defines how we secure users while using voice interfaces and make key progress towards securing the IoT infrastructure and enhancing national security. Combined with integrated education and outreach efforts, this work provides a technical foundation for designing IoT platforms with strong security and privacy properties. <br/><br/>Protecting Voice User Interfaces is fundamentally challenging, owing to the lack of effective means to authenticate and authorize the parties involved in the open and noisy channel.

Researchers collaborate with teachers in six different high schools to develop new teaching materials that use geospatial technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and GPS-enabled iPads or other mobile devices. Students use these tools to investigate local social and/or environmental topics, such as the urban heat island effect, civic impacts of urban trees, or carbon costs of different transportation systems. Each investigation involves student data collection, data visualization, and analysis, combining both students' own data and data from other sources--such as local governments, federal agencies, or researchers. The investigation concludes with students proposing a change in their communities, such as adding or re-allocating urban greenspace or expanding bike trails or pedestrian access to bridges. Each investigation is aligned to local curriculum and standards. As students complete these investigations, they (a) learn about geospatial tools and careers, (b) develop spatial thinking and reasoning skills, and (c) become motivated to pursue STEM-related college and career paths. The teachers also enhance their skills, particularly their understanding and use of geospatial tools and data sets. This project increases the reach and the diversity of the STEM pipeline in geospatial fields directly--by working with approximately 1500 students across the 6 high schools--and indirectly--through the teacher training and professional development, continuing to impact students beyond the lifespan of the project.<br/><br/>This project extends the work of a previous ITEST award that established a model for the co-design, development, and implementation of local socio-environmental science investigations (SESI) using a geospatial curriculum. The learning activities provided opportunities for students to collaborate, seek evidence, problem-solve, master technology, develop geospatial thinking and reasoning (GTR) skills, and practice communication skills, all of which are essential for the STEM workforce. This project uses an adapted form of the original SESI model to work with a larger and more varied group of high school students across three different regions: urban areas in Delaware and Pennsylvania (Lehigh University), rural Washington state (Washington State University Tri-Cities), and urban Texas (Texas Christian University). At each of these sites, university faculty collaborate with two high schools to form a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) to co-design, develop, and implement SESI activities embedded within the school?s regular curriculum. Student outcomes consist of geospatial thinking and reasoning skills (assessed via a performance task), STEM college and career interest (adapted career inventory), and spatial learning attitudes (adapted learning preferences questionnaire). Subgroups for analysis include engaged versus unengaged learners--that is, those who complete all required assignments and projects versus those who do not. Student outcomes on college and career interest and spatial learning attitudes are compared to those of a control group, drawn from a similar population (same school or same district). Teacher outcomes include their geospatial technology use and knowledge, measured by the Geospatial Science Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge questionnaire. The research also examines impacts within each school and each RPP. The project contributes to the knowledge base on geospatial curriculum design and development in a variety of settings (urban, suburban, rural), student outcomes from curriculum-aligned geospatial tools use, teacher professional development on geospatial technology integration, integration of geospatial tool usage across different units of high schools (different academic departments, different support services such as ESL and special education), and the formation and function of RPPs centered on curriculum-aligned geospatial education.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The shape memory effect can be illustrated by the ability of a material to remember and recover a programmed shape via thermal and mechanical input.  Superelasticity refers to the ability of a material to recover a large amount of mechanical deformation at a given temperature.  Superelasticity in organic crystals - through interconvertible phase changes - is a recently discovered materials phenomenon. This discovery will likely breed a new research field on polymorphic engineering of molecular crystals, providing a way of overcoming the intrinsic fragility (brittleness) of organic crystals in deformable electronics.  Polymorphism is the ability of a material to exist in more than one crystal structure (ordered molecular arrangement).  This award explores the fundamental relationship between those structural states and the functionalities of superelasticity, ferroelasticity, and shape memory.  Electronic devices with SOSs as active layers can respond to environmental stimuli without additional circuits and find a variety of applications such as remote sensing, memory devices, and programmable electronics. SOSs are also intriguing when it comes to their mechanically and thermally tunable electrical and optical properties. With the potential to create new forms of electronic and optical devices, it is vital to understand and rationalize the mechanics of superelastic organic semiconductors. This research project will both theoretically and experimentally analyze the deformability and shape memory in organic semiconductors under mechanical and thermal load and further understand the fundamental relationship between the mechanical, thermal, and optoelectronic properties of SOSs. The research will leverage the educational and outreach activities based on new curriculum development integrating data sciences, engineering education for K-12 students through an existing collaboration with Women in Engineering Program at Purdue, and engagement of underrepresented groups in engineering sciences.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to understand the mechanics and molecular mechanism of superelasticity, ferroelasticity, and shape memory effect in a new class of organic semiconductors using multi-scale theoretical modeling and experimentation approaches. The research will (i) understand the cooperative molecular mechanism underlying the deformability and shape memory effect in the solid-state molecular crystal, (ii) understand the thermodynamics, kinetics, and stress profiles along the trajectory of the martensitic transition under the thermal and mechanical load, (iii) understand the molecular kinetics and deformation twinning/detwinning in organic crystals responsible for the superelasticity, ferroelasticity, and shape memory effect, and (iv) establish the structure-property relationship by understanding the mechanical, electronic, optical, and thermal properties of SOSs for the use in optoelectronics. Overall, the research project is to address a grand challenge in the fundamental understanding of molecular structures of macroscopic and reversible deformation in response to external stimuli. The fundamental understanding of superelasticity/ferroelasticity in organic crystals will create new knowledge about the martensitic phase transition in solid-state molecules. Such knowledge can open new avenues for rapid, reversible modulation of electronic and optical properties by means of molecular design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Augustine Volcano in Alaska is one of the most frequently active volcanoes in the US and is considered a very high threat by the U.S. Geological Survey. The hazards posed by a volcano depend on the size and style of an eruption, and many questions remain as to what controls these eruption characteristics at intermediate arc volcanoes like Augustine. For example, are large and explosive eruptions driven by larger volumes of magma supply at shallow depths in the crust, or by faster ascent rates, or both? Prehistoric tephras (named Tephra B and Tephra M) that erupted from Augustine Volcano can provide insight into how eruptive behavior changes through time. This project has as a goal to investigate the links between magma plumbing systems and eruption explosivity. It will target two of the primary factors that determine eruption style: magma composition and the rate at which the magma ascends through the crust. Important societal benefits will emerge from this work, specifically related to volcanic hazards in the US, and that are broadly applicable to other intermediate arc volcanoes globally. Finally, this project initiates new volcano observatory-academic partnerships between the Alaska Volcano Observatory, Colgate University, and Middlebury College. This partnership will accelerate the translation of basic science to applications and monitoring that will provide active research-based curricula at two undergraduate institutions. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) use whole rock (pumice), phenocryst, glass, and melt inclusion geochemical data to identify the number, geometry, and relationships between the subsurface magmatic reservoirs that fed the eruptions that produced units Tephra M and Tephra B at Augustine, 2) investigate indicators of magmatic ascent rate such as volatile concentrations, crystal textures, and bubble textures within the erupted material, 3) characterize how volcanic plumbing systems evolve through time by comparing tephras B and M to historic and older prehistoric and Pleistocene deposits, and 4) investigate small-scale variability in eruption style through detailed sampling within the stratigraphy of Tephras M and B, with a targeted effort to characterize both microlite-poor and microlite-rich samples. This will resolve some of the observational bias that exists in Augustine?s record, and will help characterize the potential magnitude and importance of this bias at intermediate arc volcanoes. Data from this project will provide new constraints on the physical and chemical processes that drive ascent and explosivity and determine how magma storage reservoirs evolve over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will enable energy-accountability in commercial buildings by providing actionable recommendations with quantifiable savings, as well as insights for both occupants and building managers so that they can act in a timely manner. These small savings can add up: even a small 1% reduction in commercial building energy consumption translates to 1.5 billion dollars of annual savings for the nation.

Modern data-driven methods for developing NLP tools generally rely on the availability of enormous amounts of data for the language in question, an obstacle that may be insurmountable for many languages, especially languages lacking significant digital resources and languages with small or diminishing numbers of speakers. This project aims to remove barriers to developing NLP tools for languages with less data, developing new methods that incorporate knowledge about linguistic properties of languages into models learned from data. Learning how to build faster paths to NLP tools for new languages has the potential to rapidly advance the state of language technology for any language. In addition, the tools and knowledge developed here have the potential to speed up the description of endangered languages, helping to secure an informed record of the world's languages while there are still speakers to learn from.<br/><br/>The imbalance in access to language technologies arises in part because current NLP models and algorithms need to learn from large amounts of training data. This project addresses that imbalance by adapting methods from cross-lingual transfer learning, in which models learned on one language are adapted and exploited to make predictions for another language. One innovation of this project is to investigate the incorporation of expert linguistic knowledge for improving model transfer. Two types of linguistic knowledge will be injected into artificial neural network models for morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging: a) knowledge about relationships between individual languages and language families; and b) knowledge about specific linguistic properties of individual languages and language families.

Researchers collaborate with teachers in six different high schools to develop new teaching materials that use geospatial technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) and GPS-enabled iPads or other mobile devices. Students use these tools to investigate local social and/or environmental topics, such as the urban heat island effect, civic impacts of urban trees, or carbon costs of different transportation systems. Each investigation involves student data collection, data visualization, and analysis, combining both students' own data and data from other sources--such as local governments, federal agencies, or researchers. The investigation concludes with students proposing a change in their communities, such as adding or re-allocating urban greenspace or expanding bike trails or pedestrian access to bridges. Each investigation is aligned to local curriculum and standards. As students complete these investigations, they (a) learn about geospatial tools and careers, (b) develop spatial thinking and reasoning skills, and (c) become motivated to pursue STEM-related college and career paths. The teachers also enhance their skills, particularly their understanding and use of geospatial tools and data sets. This project increases the reach and the diversity of the STEM pipeline in geospatial fields directly--by working with approximately 1500 students across the 6 high schools--and indirectly--through the teacher training and professional development, continuing to impact students beyond the lifespan of the project.<br/><br/>This project extends the work of a previous ITEST award that established a model for the co-design, development, and implementation of local socio-environmental science investigations (SESI) using a geospatial curriculum. The learning activities provided opportunities for students to collaborate, seek evidence, problem-solve, master technology, develop geospatial thinking and reasoning (GTR) skills, and practice communication skills, all of which are essential for the STEM workforce. This project uses an adapted form of the original SESI model to work with a larger and more varied group of high school students across three different regions: urban areas in Delaware and Pennsylvania (Lehigh University), rural Washington state (Washington State University Tri-Cities), and urban Texas (Texas Christian University). At each of these sites, university faculty collaborate with two high schools to form a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) to co-design, develop, and implement SESI activities embedded within the school?s regular curriculum. Student outcomes consist of geospatial thinking and reasoning skills (assessed via a performance task), STEM college and career interest (adapted career inventory), and spatial learning attitudes (adapted learning preferences questionnaire). Subgroups for analysis include engaged versus unengaged learners--that is, those who complete all required assignments and projects versus those who do not. Student outcomes on college and career interest and spatial learning attitudes are compared to those of a control group, drawn from a similar population (same school or same district). Teacher outcomes include their geospatial technology use and knowledge, measured by the Geospatial Science Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge questionnaire. The research also examines impacts within each school and each RPP. The project contributes to the knowledge base on geospatial curriculum design and development in a variety of settings (urban, suburban, rural), student outcomes from curriculum-aligned geospatial tools use, teacher professional development on geospatial technology integration, integration of geospatial tool usage across different units of high schools (different academic departments, different support services such as ESL and special education), and the formation and function of RPPs centered on curriculum-aligned geospatial education.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These environmental changes often result in conditions suitable for local or global disease outbreaks. Once outbreaks are underway specialists in the ecology of infectious diseases are frequently asked to provide timely input, sometimes on disease systems that are not well known. One example is the recent rapid expansion of Zika virus in the Americas. However, appropriate data are often unavailable, for example because the species involved in transmission of an emerging pathogen are not known. What is needed is a better understanding of general principles underlying disease outbreaks and a toolkit of responses that slow disease spread. This project will produce synthesis papers describing aspects of ecological epidemiology and the relationship between biodiversity and health. These papers will be broadly accessible to students, scientists, and policy makers, and will help foster better-informed societal responses to disease outbreaks.  <br/><br/>One general principle that applies to many (but not all) disease systems is the dilution effect, in which ecological communities with higher species diversity have lower disease risk through a suite of well-understood mechanisms. Unfortunately, applications of the dilution effect to prediction and mitigation of infectious disease outbreaks are compromised by confusion about what it does and does not assert, and by misunderstandings of how it could be applied in policy and management. The project will synthesize current studies and provide an overview of the dilution effect, including the basic biology that underlies it. This synthesis paper be useful for students interested in health or ecology, and health professionals developing strategies for combating infectious diseases. A second synthesis will identify general principles linking biodiversity and health, which could guide future studies by providing more robust conceptual foundations than are currently available. This paper would be useful for disease ecologists and people in allied disciplines such as medical entomology or public health. In sum, these two products, will help move the field of disease ecology towards a more predictive future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Augustine Volcano in Alaska is one of the most frequently active volcanoes in the US and is considered a very high threat by the U.S. Geological Survey. The hazards posed by a volcano depend on the size and style of an eruption, and many questions remain as to what controls these eruption characteristics at intermediate arc volcanoes like Augustine. For example, are large and explosive eruptions driven by larger volumes of magma supply at shallow depths in the crust, or by faster ascent rates, or both? Prehistoric tephras (named Tephra B and Tephra M) that erupted from Augustine Volcano can provide insight into how eruptive behavior changes through time. This project has as a goal to investigate the links between magma plumbing systems and eruption explosivity. It will target two of the primary factors that determine eruption style: magma composition and the rate at which the magma ascends through the crust. Important societal benefits will emerge from this work, specifically related to volcanic hazards in the US, and that are broadly applicable to other intermediate arc volcanoes globally. Finally, this project initiates new volcano observatory-academic partnerships between the Alaska Volcano Observatory, Colgate University, and Middlebury College. This partnership will accelerate the translation of basic science to applications and monitoring that will provide active research-based curricula at two undergraduate institutions. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) use whole rock (pumice), phenocryst, glass, and melt inclusion geochemical data to identify the number, geometry, and relationships between the subsurface magmatic reservoirs that fed the eruptions that produced units Tephra M and Tephra B at Augustine, 2) investigate indicators of magmatic ascent rate such as volatile concentrations, crystal textures, and bubble textures within the erupted material, 3) characterize how volcanic plumbing systems evolve through time by comparing tephras B and M to historic and older prehistoric and Pleistocene deposits, and 4) investigate small-scale variability in eruption style through detailed sampling within the stratigraphy of Tephras M and B, with a targeted effort to characterize both microlite-poor and microlite-rich samples. This will resolve some of the observational bias that exists in Augustine?s record, and will help characterize the potential magnitude and importance of this bias at intermediate arc volcanoes. Data from this project will provide new constraints on the physical and chemical processes that drive ascent and explosivity and determine how magma storage reservoirs evolve over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the financial industry is now experimenting with blockchains and smart contract protocols to improve efficiency and combat fraud in digital asset markets. However, state-of-the-art systems require increasingly complex designs to meet performance and security requirements. For example, they incorporate parallel or partitioned architectures for better performance, as well as cryptographic techniques like zero knowledge proofs to mitigate privacy risks. Furthermore, some of the most successful distributed systems are platforms that can be extended by non-expert application developers writing customized ?smart contract? programs. All of these complicate the task of defining security, let alone proving it, and as a result most distributed systems are still deployed without any rigorous security model at all. This project will address the above challenges by designing new programming language abstractions for defining and analyzing the security of distributed protocols.<br/> <br/>This project is organized along two research directions. The first goal is to bridge the field of programming language design and the widely-used Universal Composability (UC) theory from cryptography. UC a popular standard because of its modularity and strong guarantees, and is widely used for on-paper analysis of blockchain protocols; integrating this into a programming framework will enable application developers to benefit from this modular design approach. The second research thrust aims to explore a new distributed system architecture, called ?robust sharded MPC,"" aimed at providing better scalability and security than existing designs. Combining robust multiparty computation (MPC) together with zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) will be able to overcome the expressiveness limitations of the current state-of-the-art, where ZKP is used alone. By bridging distributed systems and applied cryptography, the approach is unique in using robust sharded MPC to overcome limitations of the state-of-the-art based on zero knowledge proofs alone.  The project will release open source software and to help validate the security of blockchain protocols deployed or in development today, and to support courses and curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have been the object of scientific quest since 1966 because they are predicted to have far superior heat resistance, mechanical, electrical, optical and other physical properties, compared to their non-ladder counterparts. However, such ideal ladder polymers have remained unrealized materials because of the difficulty of making them. This project aims to develop a novel chemistry for making various ladder polymers. The project will also investigate the structural and physical properties of the new materials. The resulting new ladder polymers will enable testing of longstanding predictions of their properties. The new materials could also find applications in areas such as electronics, biosensors and wearable devices, aerospace structures, 3D printing, electrical energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors), and photovoltaic devices. The research project will also facilitate education of graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities, in emerging science and engineering fields.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>Conjugated ladder polymers are predicted to have far superior structural and physical properties, compared to their non-ladder counterparts, due to their ribbon-like topology. However, these materials have largely remained a dream because the challenge of making them directly has remained unsolved. This research project aims to tackle this scientific challenge by exploring a novel approach. The overall goal of the project is to develop new chemistry for the synthesis of diverse well-defined, soluble, regioregular conjugated ladder polymers and investigate their properties. Specifically, the PI and his group will: (1) design and synthesize new multifunctional monomers suitable for making the regioregular conjugated ladder polymers; (2) develop polymerization methods for the one-step synthesis of the conjugated ladder polymers; (3) investigate the effects of regioregularity on the structure, morphology and physical properties of conjugated ladder polymers; and (4) investigate the morphology, charge transport and photophysics of the new conjugated ladder polymers. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The winter storminess reconstruction is related to the strength of the Aleutian Low-pressure system (AL) and its analysis has the potential to transform the understanding of cold season ocean-atmospheric variability in the North Pacific. Specific goals of this project are to: 1) Generate 2,000-year-long records of wintertime AL along with summer temperature variability to determine how they responded to past climate forcing. 2) Use dendrochronology to precisely date when seven land-terminating and two tidewater glaciers advanced and retreated during the last 4000. 3) Test the hypothesis that the most extensive Holocene glacier advances in south coastal Alaska occurred when cooler summer air temperatures (reduced melt) coincided with a strengthened AL (increased snowfall). <br/><br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include the collection of time-sensitive archives of buried wood that would be available to the scientific communities for multi-disciplinary investigations.

This project will provide training for four undergraduate students as part of their undergraduate thesis including field work, data analysis and presentation of the results. The researchers will engage in public outreach by giving two talks at Glacier Bay National Park.

Its development today is bound up with political and moral desires and far-reaching claims that the technology has the capacity to challenge or even replace the existing financial system and its centralized institutions with decentralized organizations and governance. In the long wake of the 2008/09 financial crisis, blockchain's promise of decentralization has resonated. But if the vision of decentralization is initially based on the distributed networks architecture of computer systems, what happens when people try to translate it into social reality? What cultural, economic and political concepts and sensibilities underpin the making of blockchain, and how does the technology's development in turn influence human behavior? This project investigates the human dimensions of an opaque yet increasingly widespread technology, formulating both academic and non-academic descriptions and arguments about blockchain's sociocultural and political-economic contours for scholars and broader publics. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in developing more effective methods for communicating science and the scientific method to the public.<br/><br/>The research will consist of fourteen months of ethnographic study in two established blockchain hubs, which are also home to lively crypto-communities. The two research locations allow for comparative tracking of how distinct political, economic, social, and cultural situations and discourses bear on blockchain development. Asking how a digital native or Internet-based infrastructure becomes meaningful across highly uneven economic, geopolitical, and cultural-linguistic contexts, the project also examines how blockchain gains traction in relation to or even at the expense of other matters of concern. In both locations, research will investigate how blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders (1) define value, and how they understand blockchain as a technology that identifies, makes or manipulates value; (2) what attracts them to blockchain; (3) how they think blockchain will and/or should change human relations; and (4) how they imagine decentralization in relation to blockchain's promise. Through data gathered at blockchain-oriented promotional, educational, and networking events, conferences, and hackathons, from online, social and journalistic media, and through interviews with engineers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders, the investigation will produce results shedding light on the nature of blockchain as a technology of value and its promise of economic and social decentralization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically manufactured utilizing petroleum feedstocks, the continued use of polymers, such as a polyurethanes, is impacted by questions around recyclability and environmental impacts. The transformation of biomass into value-added polymers is a promising route to develop materials with comparable performance and lower cost, and that can be designed for an optimal product lifecycle. Utilizing wood biomass, the team will design, synthesize, and characterize high-performance polymers, investigate more sustainable approaches to the generation of polymers, and study the influence of wood diversity on material properties and environmental impact.  These bioderived polymers have potential applications as membranes, elastomers, and foams. <br/><br/>Sustainability in the context of new materials design will be leveraged as a framework for broadening participation in science and engineering fields at all levels -? K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and aspiring faculty -- via strategic partnerships, mentoring activities, and educational activities. High school internships and research opportunities will prepare underrepresented students for science and engineering college pathways. Mentoring activities for female graduate students and post-docs will be implemented, focusing on shared experiences and sustained dialogue. Diversifying the professoriate with a focus on soft materials will be targeted via an annual workshop, expanded to include concepts of collaborative, multidisciplinary research.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Alternative synthetic approaches are critical for the utilization of biomass building blocks in the development of robust polymeric materials with exceptional mechanical function and thermal properties. Lignocellulosic biomass, particularly the lignin fraction, is an attractive source of diverse, abundant, and inexpensive precursors for macromolecular design. Bisguaiacols, such as the newly-developed bisguaiacol A (BGA) ?- an entirely bio-based, methoxy-substituted analogue to bisphenol A (BPA) -- are robust and potentially safer components for the design of polymeric systems with enhanced properties. Utilizing lignin-based biomass as a primary synthetic precursor, the PIs will investigate the following strategies in the design of sustainable routes for bio-based polymeric materials ? polysulfones (PSFs) and polyurethanes (PUs) with enhanced material properties: (i) synthesis of new bisguaiacol analogues for BPA-replacements for polymerization; (ii) development of schemes for ?green? PU synthesis; (iii) exploration of the influence of biomass source on thermomechanical behavior; (iv) construction of structure-property-processing relationships; (v) toxicity assessment of these bisguaiacol-based polymers; (vi) examination of reprocessability in bisguaiacol-derived PU networks; and (vii) exploration of additive manufacturing conditions and post-functionalize strategies for scale-up. Expertise in materials science, polymer chemistry, and chemical engineering will drive this fundamental research program that spans the inclusion of diverse lignin sources, synthesis of sustainable building blocks, macromolecular design and characterization, and manufacturing of ?green? polymers for a diverse set of applications.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One learns early and often that these measurements can have, depending on the source, varying degrees of reliability. Typically, these inaccurate measurements form a notion of ""noise"". Gathering billions of data observations per second, from millions of different sources, creates a myriad of problems; this project seeks to develop new ways to identify and counteract noise and the resulting instability in numerical and statistical tools. Such identification and extraction of systematic outliers from the data observations can be useful in applications of cyber-security, networking, and privacy. The project motivates these techniques through the lens of several existing problem frameworks; these have been successful in practice and in theory for decades, but still have shortcomings in the presence of systematic outliers. The tools developed during this project could be employed by virtually any practitioner of data science or machine learning. The ideas, specifically dealing with outlier detection and rejection, also have relevance to communication, medicine, geology, and social choice.<br/><br/>It has been shown recently that such very noisy models can be handled by techniques that take a geometric perspective of the data, and impose structural constraints that are not typically realized in the real-world, but preserve enough features of the data so that classical notions of data processing and statistical analysis may be applied.  In this project, new practical algorithms will be developed for feature extraction that use the floating body as a measure of data dispersion. This geometric structure has been proven to capture enough structure of a data set that one can still accurately extract important structural features, while allowing for significant portions of the data to be corrupt. This tool enables classical algorithms such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to operate on data that has heavy-tailed noise, which would otherwise cause numerical instability. Further, the project will use the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) to identify more general assumptions that can allow one to take advantage of robust statistical tools and optimization techniques. The flexibility of this is that one can use the GCLT to prove convergence of numerical algorithms when the underlying model itself does not exactly fit the parameters of robust estimation routines. Finally, the project will involve furthering applications of using ICA as a tool in algorithmic reductions for data analysis. It has already been shown to enable efficient learning algorithms, and demonstrating that some geometric learning problems (e.g. learning halfspace intersections) can be tackled by statistical techniques. This nicely complements the above research directions, which aim to break algorithmic barriers in statistical problems by using primarily geometric tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many chemical manufacturing and emission control processes use precious metals as catalysts to speed up the chemical reactions.  The use of precious metals in industrial catalysts is not sustainable because of the low abundance and high cost of these metals. The use of supported single metal atoms for catalytic transformation may address these problems. The critical challenge for broad applications of single-atom catalysts is their stability during use. In this project, Dr. Jingyue (Jimmy) Liu of Arizona State University is developing ""nanoglues"" to both stabilize the supported single metal atoms and enhance their catalytic performance. This project is addressing fundamental understanding of catalysis by supported metal atoms and is providing design tools for developing single atom catalysts with practical applications important to the environment and the economy. Professor Liu impacts education through the ASU Winter School on High Resolution Electron Microscopy, attended primarily by graduate students. In addition, the SCience and ENgineering Experience (SCENE) program is providing cutting-edge science research experiences to high school students in grades 10-12. <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Jingyue (Jimmy) Liu of Arizona State University is developing a fundamental understanding of how to localize, and simultaneously enhance the catalytic properties of, single metal atoms (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir or Au) by confining them to isolated, ultra-small functional oxide nanoclusters (e.g., CeOx, TiOx, and CoOx).  These nanoglues are uniformly grafted onto a high-surface-area robust support (e.g., silica or alumina). With such a catalyst design, it is expected that single metal atoms or small metal clusters do not sinter during the catalyst activation process (e.g., by H2 at 250 C - 500 C) and/or during catalytic reactions at elevated temperatures under reducing environment. The use of supported, isolated metal atoms as catalytically-active centers not only maximizes the metal usage efficiency but also makes it possible to have uniform distribution of active sites.  These factors are important for tuning the selectivity of a targeted catalytic reaction. The catalyst design allows metal atoms to move within their corresponding isolated nanoglue islands but not across the nanoglues to form larger particles. The nanoglue not only acts as a ?double-sided tape? to strongly hold both the metal atoms and the high-surface-area support but also provides the desired function for the targeted catalytic activity and/or selectivity. The sizes of the nanoglue islands range 0.5-2.0 nm to accommodate high levels of metal loading. The nanoglue-based single-atom catalysts are being tested for CO oxidation, preferential oxidation of CO, water-gas shift, reforming, and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Broader impacts include incorporating research results in an annual Winter Workshop of High Resolution Electron Microscopy (attended primarily by graduate students from across the US), training of graduate and undergraduate research students, and mentoring of high school students through the SCience and ENgineering Experience (SCENE) program dedicated to providing cutting-edge science research experiences to high school students in grades 10-12.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The multi-millennial tree-ring chronology will be used to extend reconstructions of spring and summer temperatures and build new records of winter storminess by analyzing traumatic resin ducts in annual tree rings. The winter storminess reconstruction is related to the strength of the Aleutian Low-pressure system (AL) and its analysis has the potential to transform the understanding of cold season ocean-atmospheric variability in the North Pacific. Specific goals of this project are to: 1) Generate 2,000-year-long records of wintertime AL along with summer temperature variability to determine how they responded to past climate forcing. 2) Use dendrochronology to precisely date when seven land-terminating and two tidewater glaciers advanced and retreated during the last 4000. 3) Test the hypothesis that the most extensive Holocene glacier advances in south coastal Alaska occurred when cooler summer air temperatures (reduced melt) coincided with a strengthened AL (increased snowfall). <br/><br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include the collection of time-sensitive archives of buried wood that would be available to the scientific communities for multi-disciplinary investigations.

This research project aims to make progress on questions in extremal combinatorics using methods from algebra and probability theory. The research focuses on some longstanding open questions and conjectures, as well as several related problems. The work will lead to the development of new mathematical tools and techniques and push the limits of known methods. Moreover, through her teaching and mentoring, the investigator strives to encourage students to learn about mathematics and to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The questions studied in this project fall into two rough topic areas. The first of these areas is centered around the slice rank polynomial method that was introduced in 2016. This method has led to several spectacular results in additive combinatorics, but many related questions remain open. The investigator intends to study specific problems exemplifying the current limitations of the slice rank polynomial method. One aim of this project is to find ways to make the method more flexible and more widely applicable. The second topic area of the project concerns the inducibility problem, which was posed over forty years ago and is still wide open. Given a fixed graph H, and a large integer n, this problem asks about the maximum number of induced copies of H that an n-vertex graph can contain. A major open question in this area is the case where the graph H is a path or a cycle.

Yet the origins and impact of such contention are poorly understood. Having a better understanding of the factors that drive protest will enhance American economic competitiveness and inform foreign policy. As American public institutions and private firms commonly provide funding and technology for energy ventures abroad, the research is disseminated through targeted publications and a public conference with relevant governmental, industry, financial, and non-governmental stakeholders.

Recently, however, there has been a drive on the part of industry and professional schools in high-resource regions to design assistive devices specifically for people living in low-resource settings. In designing for this new market, engineers and device makers frequently modify standard prototypes by using cheaper materials and simplifying product design to make the final product easier to build, use, and repair. But the intended recipients value more than simplicity and cost when it comes to assistive devices. They use assistive technology to help them develop new social relationships, engage in paid work, function as care-givers, and address the negative impact of disability on their identities. This project seeks to understand how engineers from high-income regions develop new kinds of designs when they build prosthetic legs intended for recipients in low-resource settings. It then asks how people in in low-resource regions accept, reject, or alter assistive devices to better meet their needs for self-efficacy, improved economic prospects, and social relationships. Broader impacts of this research include advancing scholarship about how culture and social relationships influence the ways people living in low-income regions use technology to address disability. It will also promote capacity building by training local research assistants in mixed-methods social science research, uncovering pathways of resource distribution, and publicizing findings about resource adaptation and use to organizations by and for persons with disabilities. <br/><br/>This mixed-methods project blends qualitative and quantitative data collection and fieldwork to understand how designers in high-resource regions can best design prosthetics for users in low-resource regions. It begins with participant observation in a high-resource region with a bioengineering group that distributes 3D printers capable of printing prosthetic limbs for children at a pediatric orthopedic hospital in low-resource settings. These observations are then complimented with data from the low-resource region captured by administering semi-structured interviews and distributing quantitative surveys to those who have sustained limb-loss, their family members, and health care providers. The project thus enhances understanding of the assumptions that engineers and prosthetists living in high-resource regions make about the needs of their end-users as they develop devices intended for recipients living in low-resource regions, and how people in low-resource settings accept, reject, or alter assistive devices to better meet their needs. Taken together, project results can help enable the production of more effective prosthetics for low-resource regions. This research advances  Science and Technology Studies by studying how the inequitable distribution of technological innovations in the form of assistive devices influences how individuals and communities in high and low-resource settings perceive ""normal"" and ""disabled"" bodies, navigate health systems, and reorganize social relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional data management strategies will need to be altered to take advantage of the different types of memory in each tier, but doing so faces a number of challenges. The primary goal of this project is to develop software systems and tools that enable better performance and efficiency for emerging memory systems while also reducing barriers that could limit their adoption. This research will develop insights into how to collect and analyze memory behavior, how typical computer applications use memory resources, and how systems with complex memory hardware should manage application data. This will allow other researchers to create and explore new techniques to manage memory more effectively, and has the potential to significantly improve both performance and energy efficiency in these emerging systems. Additionally, this work promises to generate new knowledge in the areas of static analysis, program profiling, and feedback-directed optimization for the purposes of predicting and guiding memory management. The results of this research will also be integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework to advance curriculum and student knowledge of the latest software systems and memory technologies. <br/><br/>A key concept driving this research is that the distribution and usage of memory resources depend upon activities that occur in different layers of the vertical execution stack, including the applications, operating system, and hardware. By increasing coordination among these activities, this research will reduce inefficiencies that arise from making data management decisions with limited information and enable fine-grained, flexible, and efficient data management. To achieve this objective, a collaborative data management framework will be created where: 1) the application runtime will use automated program profiling and analysis to partition data objects into separate heap regions according to their expected usage behavior and will convey this information to the OS, and 2) the OS will incorporate and use this information to direct physical memory allocation and recycling across the memory tier hierarchy.<br/><br/>All of the generated data, code, and results related to this project will be made available through public git repositories.

In these applications, the collected data are usually associated with a network structure, and the network structure may correspond to communication links in wireless networks, information flows in social networks, and causal relationships between the network nodes. Compared to individual entities, network data, by their interconnected nature, contain rich causal and correlation information, and present both complication and opportunity for statistical inference. Timely detection of dynamic events as soon as they occur is a problem of great interest, especially as false alarms are possible in networks of really large sizes, and measurements taken from one part of the network may not accurately capture events in another part of the network. This project addresses this challenge and develops a comprehensive framework for dynamic event detection in networks with time-series data. The developed methodology in this project can benefit a wide range of applications, e.g., intrusion detection in computer networks, epidemic detection, seismic event detection, and fake news detection in social networks. This project will substantially advance the understanding of how to accurately model and sequentially detect an event with a dynamic nature, and how to exploit network topology for reliable and computationally efficient detection in networks. <br/><br/>In the project, the following two thrusts will be explored: (i) detection of dynamics at a single node; and (ii) detection of dynamics in the network.

It has a variety of important applications, including disaster management, supply chain design, health care, and harvest planning. Most real-world problems are complicated enough to generate a very large-size SP model, which is difficult to solve. Quickly finding the optimal solutions of these models is critical for decision-making when facing uncertainties. Existing optimization algorithms have a limited capability of solving large-scale SP problems. Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning can give computers the ability to ""learn"" with data by using statistical techniques. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning-based computational framework to solve large-scale stochastic programming problems effectively and efficiently by integrating machine learning techniques into optimization algorithms. The project will broaden the scope and applicability of machine learning in operations research. Furthermore, this research will support the cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in engineering and computer sciences, as well as the development of new curricula in the interface of machine learning and optimization algorithms.<br/><br/>The project will be the pioneering study of applying machine learning into stochastic programming, while existing works usually focus on using stochastic programming to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Motivated by the challenges from practices and limitations of current optimization algorithms, two research objectives are proposed: efficient sample generation and convergence acceleration, by taking sample average approximation and L-shaped algorithm as examples. The first research objective is to design a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on solution information to efficiently generate samples for sample average approximation. The second research objective is to develop a supervised learning algorithm to estimate a tight upper bound for expediting convergence of L-shaped method. The two research objectives will be achieved through five tasks: (1) semi-supervised learning-based scenario grouping; (2) supervised learning based representative scenario selection; (3) performance analysis for sample generation; (4) supervised learning based upper bound prediction; and (5) performance analysis for the machine learning-based L-shaped method.

They can offer unprecedented properties beyond those currently studied and used. The goal of this fellowship proposal is to augment the advantages of a multilayered design in a metal-ceramic nanocomposite that is hypothesized to exhibit tunable strength and toughness, by the selective activation of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale. The metal-ceramic multilayered nanocomposite is composed of alternating metallic and MAX phase layers with a lamellar thickness reduced to the nanoscale. Because of the ideal, highly oriented structure that prevails across the film, each film contains thousands of ""like layers"", and a high density of interfaces. MAX phases are a family of ceramic materials consisting of laminated ternary carbide or nitride materials, and they represent a novel class of layered solids, where Mn+1Xn layers are interleaved with pure A-group element layers. These metal-MAX multilayered nanocomposite thin films show uniform interface spacing (~2 to 100?s of nm apart) and uniform interface plane and crystallography throughout the film. MAX phases have applications in multiple technological fields, including high temperature structural applications, protective coatings, sensors, tunable damping films for microelectromechanical systems, etc., along with potential applications in cladding materials for nuclear use. The ability to have a strong yet ductile metal-MAX composite with improved mechanical behavior to satisfy the demands of such applications will provide considerable technological and economic benefits. This research is an integrated collaboration planned between the principal investigator (PI) and the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Sandia National Laboratories (CINT-SNL), which will support a postdoctoral researcher, and enable extended collaborative visits and infrastructure development opportunities at the nation?s premier national laboratory at CINT-SNL. Undergraduate education in the capstone senior design projects in the Materials department at the PI?s university will particularly benefit from this collaboration by having mentors (and possible visitations to CINT-SNL) from both national laboratory and university. <br/><br/>The objectives of this fellowship project are to leverage a fundamental understanding of the activation and confinement of deformation mechanisms directly linked to the hierarchical structure at the nanoscale in multilayered nanocomposite materials, to potentially enable tunable strength and toughness. Unlike other various multilayered systems that have been pursued in the past, the metal-MAX nanocomposites studied here are composed of a unique hierarchical topology - as interfaces between the layers are in direct competition with the internal interfaces within the MAX layers to drive the tunable macroscopic mechanical behavior. Guided by experimental synthesis and novel nanomechanical testing capabilities of the PI, computational modeling at CINT-SNL will complement the experimental component to study the fundamental mechanisms (e.g., dislocations and ripplocations) within the metal-MAX hierarchical structure. Outcomes from the fellowship project will include the development of correlations between the metal-MAX hierarchical structure, its fundamental deformation mechanisms and the resulting mechanical properties, namely strength and toughness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approaches are developed to remove unwanted noise, but unfortunately, they do not perform well in many real environments. Subsequently, the noise-removal approaches often provide low quality and unintelligible listening experiences, which results in dissatisfied and frustrated users. This Faculty Early Carrer Development project will develop noise-reduction and assessment approaches that address these issues, resulting in improved listening experiences for users. Individuals and companies that regularly use digital means (e.g. voice conferencing and hearing aids) for person-to-person communication will be major beneficiaries of this work. The data and algorithms that result from this research will be made available to benefit scientists and researchers from diverse and interdisciplinary fields. Additionally, educational activities based on this research will be integrated into various efforts to increase the number of underrepresented participants in these research areas.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop user-guided machine-learning algorithms that result in improved listening experiences in real-world noisy environments. In environments that contain many competing talkers, noise-reduction systems inadvertently remove or retain unintended speech signals. The proposed research activities will address this by (1) developing multi-modal computational approaches that identify the speech signal that a specific user wants to hear. Computational assessment metrics are generally used by researchers to assess performance, but they do not always correlate with individual user sentiment, meaning investigators have inaccurate assessment results. This project will (2) develop an effective interface for capturing and predicting short-time user assessment of quality and intelligibility. Simulated and real-world speech data differ in terms of speaker, noise and environmental characteristics, but current noise-reduction approaches are incapable of adapting to these differences on the fly. This is a major shortcoming as deployed noise-reduction systems will encounter unknown speakers and noises. The investigator will (3) develop a novel class of user-guided machine learning algorithms that utilize true and predicted user assessment in near-real time for system optimization. Successfully completing these tasks will help better understand speech perception and increase the usability of noise-reduction systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how changes in the continents depend on processes at depth relies on detailed seismic images of the earth?s interior. With great seismic data coverage, North America is a perfect site for studying continental modification in diverse settings. Although it is one of the most extensively imaged continents, the details of the underlying processes of its evolution are still elusive, largely due to the discrepancies between existing seismic images. The goal of this project is to improve the seismic image resolution of the lithosphere of the North America from the surface to its root. The models will be developed using advanced seismic imaging techniques and complementary seismic data sets that can provide more complete information about the physical properties and features of the continental lithosphere. The results of this project will contribute to the understanding of how the North American continent is built, modified and destroyed.

This project will also enhance the onsite science experience of the participants through analyzing, modeling, and visualizing the environmental seismic data collected by Raspberry Shake 3D seismometers deployed on the Michigan State University campus. <br/><br/>This project aims at accurately imaging the lithosphere of North America by mapping 3D variations of both wave speeds and the internal interfaces, including sediment base, Moho, and the lithosphere and asthenosphere boundary. With the more robust seismological constraints of lithospheric structures, the following three key scientific goals can be achieved: (1) understand how the lateral gradients of lithospheric structure control the deformation of the plate margins through thinning, rifting, thickening, and foundering; (2) systematically investigate how asthenosphere interacts with lithosphere across different tectonic environments; (3) investigate the seismic signatures within sedimentary basins and the crust corresponding to underlying lithospheric and asthenospheric processes. Complementary seismic data sets, including ambient-noise-derived Empirical Green?s Functions, and regional and teleseismic data recorded by EarthScope Transportable Array, will be assimilated with different full waveform inversion techniques.

However, excessive N applications on land have profoundly impacted aquatic ecosystems, leading to eutrophication, hypoxia (dead zones), and harmful algal blooms (HABs) in estuarine and near-shore seas. Despite great progress in understanding N transport in hydrologic systems, challenges still exist in effectively managing water quality under hydroclimate extremes (mainly drought and floods). This project addresses a fundamental issue in hydrology and Earth system science: How varied are river N loads in response to climate extremes, and why? The project focuses on the Upper Mississippi-Ohio River Basin (UMORB), a region contributing over 50% of the U.S. corn and soybean production, and 45% of the N flux from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin to the Gulf of Mexico. Research outcomes from this project will improve understanding of how the fate of N is altered by natural perturbation and human management in upstream land ecosystems and will bring new insights for reducing N loads from land to rivers to coastal oceans under more frequent climate extremes in the future. It will result in the development of novel Earth system models and lay a solid foundation for ?climate-smart? water management. The project will bridge a gap between science and practice and disseminate the most current knowledge of Earth system modeling to the public. The team will develop a Monitoring-to-Modeling (M2M) learning platform, featuring an online watershed game of ?choice and chance,? to make the complex concept of watershed management more concrete for the next-generation of scientists, land managers, policy makers, and voters.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research is to understand, quantify and predict how land-to-aquatic N loadings respond to hydroclimate extremes.

The investigators will synthesize extensive high-frequency water quality monitoring data, remote sensing images, as well as the time-series geospatial data of land use and management history in the Midwestern U.S. to unravel the mechanisms underlying N flow resilience to various extreme events. The hybrid deep learning-process based modeling framework will build up our predictive capability for the dynamics of hydrological N movement in a coupled human and natural system. The hybrid model will then be applied to assess how effective watershed management practices are, what is a reasonable N load reduction goal to be sought in the field to reach the goal of reducing hypoxia extent in the Gulf with consideration of extreme climate events, and where are holes in ?the leaky bucket.?<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Hydrologic Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research goals include constraining the thermal evolution of the free troposphere during a time period that includes several episodes of abrupt climate change; testing modeled free-troposphere responses to orbital and greenhouse-gas forcing; and testing stratosphere-to- troposphere exchange dynamics across major climate transitions. This combined measurement-modeling study will constrain the paleoclimate at altitude during the most recent major episode of global change, when circulation patterns shifted under different climatic boundary conditions. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include developing a new temperature record of the free troposphere during the last deglaciation. The application of a new isotopic tracer to investigate the dynamics of stratosphere-troposphere exchange is potentially transformative for paleoclimate research. Other broader impacts include participation of the researchers in STEM outreach events as part of their ongoing activities, including participation in the department?s annual Earth Day at Rice University with the Girl Scouts. The project will train one undergraduate and two graduate students, and support two early career researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process has a wide range of applications in night vision, thermography, remote sensing, medical imaging, and building monitoring. Despite extensive efforts, true innovations are sought to meet the needs of the rapidly advancing modern society. IR imaging is a two-step process. Power is radiated from a hot surface and then converted to an electrical signal by an IR camera. Current efforts to improve thermal imaging sensitivity focus on improving the camera, because the radiated power is believed to be limited by a physical law that dictates the amount of IR power radiated from the object at given temperature. Consequently, the temperature sensitivity for IR imaging is limited to ~ 0.04 degree C. However, this sensitivity is not fine enough, and prevents some critical applications of IR imaging. The PI will advance IR imaging by overcoming the physical law that limits radiated power. The PI will develop a coating material that drastically boosts the radiated IR power within a selected temperature range. This will effectively amplify the effective temperature variation of the object into large variation of IR imaged temperature. As a result, the temperature sensitivity of IR imaging with a conventional camera is improved by a factor of over 15, to below 0.003 degree C. Such an improvement enables sensitive detection of weak defects in integrated circuits, early diagnosis of sub-skin tumors, and inspection of sub-surface building cracks. The coating material can also be used to implement switchable radiative cooling to cool a surface when its temperature is higher than the preset temperature. The new devices to be developed and deployed will push the boundary of thermal imaging and radiative cooling much beyond the state-of-the-arts, promising great values for potential commercialization. Integrated with the research effort, the PI also proposes an educational program that will stimulate and prepare pre-college students for careers in engineering pertaining to infrared technologies.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this project is to demonstrate smart, previously non-existing thermal IR regulation devices for ultra-sensitive sub-surface IR imaging and switchable radiative cooling. The PI plans to accomplish the goal by re-imagining the Stefan-Boltzmann law of thermal radiation by lifting its limitation, to achieve orders of magnitude enhancement in IR imaging sensitivity. Materials with metal-insulator transition integrated with plasmonic resonance enable a large switching in thermal radiation, a property not found in any conventional materials. The metal-insulator transition is engineered with doping and plasmonic resonance to achieve unprecedented physical properties of temperature-dependent emissivity, which are the key innovations in this proposal. Tungsten-doping substantially expands the working temperature range of vanadium dioxide, while micro-patterned metaphotonic design reverses and amplifies the contrast in IR radiation across the transition. The resultant switching in surface emissivity at tunable and preset temperatures lays the materials foundation to smart regulation of thermal IR radiation: drastic enhancement in IR imaging sensitivity, and switchability in radiative cooling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A widespread view among brain scientists is that brains are essentially large complex networks, with each node and edge of the network itself being a complex object. Thus, to understand ourselves and to fight disorders including depression (the world?s leading burden of disease) and suicide (a current epidemic), the scientist on this project will develop mathematical and statistical tools to study networks and apply them to brain networks. This will provide a deeper understanding of human brains and contribute to preventing dysfunction and restoring function.

Their approach, ?connectal coding,? will enable brain scientists to (1) infer latent structure from individual connectomes, (2) identify meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detect relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes. The methods they develop will naturally overcome the challenges inherent in connectomics: high-dimensional non-Euclidean data with multi-level nonlinear interactions. Their procedures will extend the current state-of-the-art in terms of theoretical guarantees, computational scalability, empirical performance, and interpretability of results. The efficacy of the methods will be demonstrated on datasets spanning experimental modalities, scales, and taxa, in collaboration with domain experts who acquired the data.

Multiphase flow in porous media is mainly governed by the rheological properties of pore fluids and the gas-fluid-mineral interactions. These processes can be substantially altered by adding active suspensions, which are self-propelling objects that can inject energy, generate mechanical stress, or create flows within fluids. Active particles are revolutionizing many industrial and scientific fields, such as ferromagnetic particles for dynamic sealing, micro-robots for targeted delivery of drugs, molecular motors to facilitate cell locomotion, and motile bacteria to tune water into superfluids. Studying active fluids in porous media can renovate commercial techniques in geosystems infrastructure and subsurface energy that will increase the economic and technological competitiveness of the United States. Particularly, translating the technology of using active suspensions into the practical improvement of resource recovery and reliable waste disposal can transform and benefit society. Knowledge gained from this award can also provide insights into microbial infection, bio-microrobots design, and targeted delivery that are relevant to many environmental and health issues pertaining to the well-being of individuals in society. Research and education activities of this CAREER grant will be integrated to foster a cross-disciplinary community in energy geotechnics, inspire the interests of diverse student groups in geotechnics and STEM subjects, and broaden dissemination to the public of the critical role of geotechnical engineering in addressing global challenges related to sustainability and energy. This grant will also facilitate long-term mentoring relationships between the PI and participants, which will strengthen and diversify the underrepresented minority STEM pipeline.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER grant is to understand and model the interactions between motile bacteria and gas-liquid-mineral interfaces. Combined experimental, numerical and analytical modeling will be performed to investigate the effects of three strains of Escherichia coli with different motility (1) at the gas-liquid interface, (2) in pendant and sessile droplets, (3) as bacteria-laden interface migrating through pore space, and (4) during wetting and drying processes in porous media. This research will ultimate (1) quantify the gas-liquid interfacial tension with suspended active particles, (2) understand the role of motility on the hydrodynamic dispersion of bacteria in a pendant droplet, (3) evaluate bacteria motility to pin or depin sessile droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic mineral surfaces, (4) measure the capillary signature as active-particle-laden interfaces migrating through pore throats, and (5) model the macroscopic spreading dynamics of motile and nonmotile Escherichia coli during the wetting and drying processes in porous media. Active pore fluids are non-equilibrium systems, present novel features that are interesting scientifically in their own rights. This grant supports the fundamental understanding of the non-linear behavior of active-particle-laden interfaces, which exhibit unique capillarity signatures and buckling mechanisms as they migrate through irregular pore spaces. Research findings of how microbial motility alters multiphase flow patterns provide innovative approaches to subsurface flow management, enhanced resource recovery, adaptive control and targeted delivery of fluids (and associated heat, nutrients, and mass) transfer in porous media. The new knowledge and techniques obtained through this project can be used to develop disruptive technologies of using man-made active particles to alter many fundamental soil phenomena, such as seepage, drainage, consolidation, and liquefaction. Integrated educational objectives of this CAREER grant are to engage a cross-disciplinary community in energy geotechnics and generate greater awareness amongst the public about the geotechnical role in addressing global challenges related to sustainable and energy-viable society. To achieve these objectives, a Vertically Integrated Program on subsurface energy involving K-12 STEM students (through the Research, Experiment, Analyze, Learn REAL program), undergraduate and graduate research assistants, and high school teachers (through the Georgia Intern Fellowship for Teacher GIFT program) will be established to engage a cross-disciplinary community in active fluids through porous media. The research and educational outcomes will be disseminated through increasing scientific literacy, designing classroom challenge problems related to subsurface flow for Atlanta K-12 schools and summer camps, and developing a mobile app that students and public users can select different natural or man-made porous materials to visualize the flow of various fluids and the impacts of added active particles.

The geomagnetic field is dynamic: it shows a nearly steady westward movement; it can exhibit so-called excursions in which the magnetic north and south poles move toward the equator; and, on timescales ranging from hundreds of thousands of years to millions of years, it can undergo polarity reversals in which the magnetic poles swap positions entirely. Although these observations are well-known, the physics that controls them remains poorly understood. Massive winds present in the molten iron outer core of the Earth are responsible for the generation of the geomagnetic field, yet direct observation of these fluid motions is not possible. Instead, much of our understanding of the core and associated magnetic field, known as the geodynamo, is derived from computer models. While these models continue to provide valuable insight into the geodynamo, they cannot accurately represent the extreme conditions that characterize it. This project will address this limitation by using a combination of mathematical analysis and high-performance computer simulations to examine how fluid in the Earth?s outer core is pushed and pulled by different forces, and how these forces influence the resulting dynamics. The outcome of this work will be an improved understanding of the forces that control the evolution of the geomagnetic field, and the potential for building better models of it in the future. Additionally, most of the planets within the Solar System also have global-scale magnetic fields that are created through the same mechanism that creates the geomagnetic field; this work will also be of direct relevance for improving understanding of these planetary magnetic fields. In conjunction with the proposed research, a set of publicly available educational videos will be created with both undergraduate students and graduate students that highlights the underlying physics of planetary magnetics fields.<br/><br/>Observations suggest that planetary and stellar dynamos are common throughout the universe. Progress on understanding these systems is made difficult due to the intrinsic nonlinearity and disparate spatiotemporal scales that characterize their dynamics. Current models utilize dynamical parameters that are many orders of magnitude different than those of planetary dynamos. However, the flows within the electrically conducting interiors of planets are thought to be balanced in the sense that two or more forces are dominant. The concept of balanced flows has been exploited with great success to efficiently model fluid flow in the Earth's atmosphere, oceans and sub-solidus mantle; such reduced models provide simplified physical understanding and substantially reduced computational cost in comparison to the un-approximated governing equations. No analogous model currently exists for understanding the spherical dynamo regions of planets. Moreover, the force balance that controls planetary dynamos is still debated. This project outlines a detailed investigation using both numerical modeling and perturbation theory that will systematically unravel the dynamical behavior of planetary dynamos by examining balances on multiple length scales. The work is based on the hypotheses that planetary dynamo physics is intrinsically multiscale, that three dominant length scales control their dynamics, and that distinct balances on these three scales exist. Preliminary results point to an alternative theory of planetary dynamo physics that has the potential to reconcile the current divergent viewpoints on planetary dynamo physics. To link the education and research activities of the principal investigator in a synergistic manner, a set of educational videos related to the proposed work will be developed with a team of undergraduate research students and graduate students and made available through the world wide web.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The process by which this transition occurs is through subduction initiation along continental margins. However, modern examples and numerical models of subduction initiation remain highly contentious. The late Paleozoic (ca. 450?300 million years ago) conversion of northwestern North America from a passive to an active margin is often cited as a classic example of this fundamental plate tectonic process, but very little is known about the nature and timing of key events in northern Alaska and Yukon, Canada, that led to this subduction initiation event. This study promotes collaboration between academic researchers at three U.S. institutions and government researchers at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to better inform our understanding of late Paleozoic tectonic events in a remote and understudied region of North America. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will participate in research initiatives at each institution. In addition, the research team will collaborate with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the USGS to disseminate geologic knowledge of Arctic Alaska to the public, to enhance the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and facilitate the training of the next generation of Arctic Earth scientists.<br/><br/>Recent models for the middle Paleozoic tectonic evolution of North America (Laurentia) highlight margin-parallel transport of circum-Arctic terranes followed by widespread continental subduction initiation from the Yukon to Nevada.

The research consists of three major components: 1) the examination of synorogenic rocks coupled with the development of a regional provenance dataset; 2) a petrological, geochemical, and geochronological examination of regional Middle to Upper Devonian igneous rocks; and 3) a field-based structural study integrated with regional seismic datasets to reconstruct the style of Devonian?Carboniferous deformation in Arctic Alaska.

The process by which this transition occurs is through subduction initiation along continental margins. However, modern examples and numerical models of subduction initiation remain highly contentious. The late Paleozoic (ca. 450?300 million years ago) conversion of northwestern North America from a passive to an active margin is often cited as a classic example of this fundamental plate tectonic process, but very little is known about the nature and timing of key events in northern Alaska and Yukon, Canada, that led to this subduction initiation event. This study promotes collaboration between academic researchers at three U.S. institutions and government researchers at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to better inform our understanding of late Paleozoic tectonic events in a remote and understudied region of North America. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will participate in research initiatives at each institution. In addition, the research team will collaborate with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the USGS to disseminate geologic knowledge of Arctic Alaska to the public, to enhance the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and facilitate the training of the next generation of Arctic Earth scientists.<br/><br/>Recent models for the middle Paleozoic tectonic evolution of North America (Laurentia) highlight margin-parallel transport of circum-Arctic terranes followed by widespread continental subduction initiation from the Yukon to Nevada. However, the timing, nature, and duration of middle Paleozoic orogenic events remain ambiguous. This project will focus on key structural relationships and unique Devonian?Carboniferous synorogenic sedimentary and magmatic rocks within the Arctic Alaska terrane of northern Alaska. The research consists of three major components: 1) the examination of synorogenic rocks coupled with the development of a regional provenance dataset; 2) a petrological, geochemical, and geochronological examination of regional Middle to Upper Devonian igneous rocks; and 3) a field-based structural study integrated with regional seismic datasets to reconstruct the style of Devonian?Carboniferous deformation in Arctic Alaska. This work will provide critical new insights into the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of northwestern North America and the greater circum-Arctic region to assess the viability of several subduction initiation mechanisms.

All-solid-state battery is one of the promising candidates as the next generation energy storage technology beyond Li-ion batteries. It uses solid electrolytes eliminating the use of the flammable liquid electrolyte and is expected to improve safety as well as the energy density. However, the solid nature of the electrolyte causes several issues such as slow ionic conductance and mechanical fractures leading to the premature failure of the device, in particular at the electrochemical interfaces where complex interactions between chemical reactions and mechanical deformations take place. The fundamental insights obtained in this study can be strategically utilized to design the solid electrolyte composition and the interfacial structure to significantly improve the ionic conduction and the mechanical stability for enhancing the performance and the cycle lifetime. It will contribute to develop advanced energy storage devices beyond current Li-ion battery technologies leading to a more sustainable society and economy in the country and the world overall. The research will also incorporate educational and outreach programs to train undergraduate/graduate students and attract K-12 students to STEM fields. In addition, the project organizes an exchange program with an international automobile company contributing to the development of the industry and produce next generation scientists/engineers who have both industrial and academic experience. <br/><br/>This project aims to discover the underlying science and the unit processes of the failures in all-solid-state lithium batteries at the electrochemical interfaces.

Research examining education and intergenerational mobility has concentrated on analyzing how social class, race, and ethnicity shape educational trajectories. While parental incarceration is another characteristic that may shape educational inequality, it has been widely been ignored. This project will consider whether and how the stigma of parental incarceration contributes to inequality through differential teacher expectations and treatment. Teacher expectations and behaviors in school have implications for educational achievement and attainment, which structure the opportunities and trajectories of youth as they move into adulthood and the labor market. These implications have long-term consequences for income, social class, wellbeing, and health. Understanding how stigma affects teachers? assessments of students of incarcerated parents and evaluations of student school work will advance research by incorporating parental incarceration into analysis of the key determinants of educational inequality. Findings from the project will inform interventions in schools and influence training of teachers, so as to support educational equality and upward mobility, thus advancing American prosperity.<br/><br/>Educational inequality limits upward mobility, and the stigma of parental incarceration may influence teachers? expectations and behaviors, which in turn influence student achievement and attainment. To explore the role of stigma in teachers? assessments of youth and their work, this project will employ an experimental design. Eight hundred and fifty high school teachers will receive a student biography with randomly assigned parental incarceration status: paternal, maternal, or none. Then they will complete a series of tasks that relate to student academic skills and behaviors. Participants will grade and provide feedback on the student?s writing sample and evaluate the student?s competency. Then, participants will respond to questions about student behavioral incidents and create behavioral management plans. Finally, participants will respond to a series of questions about themselves and the experiment. This experiment will create qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. The quantitative data, including the writing score, length of feedback, assessment of student competency, and behavioral response questions, will be analyzed using t-tests and regression to compare the intervention groups, paternal and maternal incarceration, to the control group of no parental incarceration. The qualitative data will be analyzed using a general inductive method to explore differences in the tone, texture, and style between the intervention groups and control group. Findings from the project will inform social psychological theories of stigma, and inform sociological theories related to educational inequality and social mobility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The terrestrial or land component of water, energy and carbon cycles are strongly linked and operate in a harmonized manner. For example, an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide modifies the amount of vegetation biomass, thus altering ecosystem photosynthesis and transpiration (hence, heat exchange) rates. Land Surface Models used in hydrologic, ecological and climate models require accurate representation of the links between terrestrial cycles. The lack of direct observation of key variables that can quantify these linkages result in uncertain projections from these models. Using satellite information on land surface state measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature and vegetation index, this project applies a novel observation-driven approach to diagnose and map the linkages at regional scale. Mapping the linkages across different seasons, ecological and environmental conditions advances understanding of how the terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles are linked and operate in the real world. The educational goal of this CAREER proposal is to enhance environmental knowledge and promote scientific discovery on the part of graduate, undergraduate and 6-12th precollege students in the Washington DC area. This education effort includes engaging minority students from local schools in STEM fields with a focus on climate and land-atmosphere interaction. <br/><br/>This research addresses the current knowledge gap in understanding the spatio-temporal variations of land-atmosphere interactions/couplings. The research plan includes (i) developing a state of the art framework based on a variational methodology to diagnose and map the linkages between the terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycles across a range of temporal and spatial scales from the implicit information contained in land surface state observations; (ii) testing the methodology at point scale (field site, synthetic simulations) and at large scale (Continental US) (iii) and expanding our fundamental understanding of the coupling between the terrestrial cycles by mapping and studying the linkages across different biomes, echo hydrological regions, seasons and environmental conditions.  The observation-driven form of the linkages between the cycles can be used to guide improvements in the predictive capabilities of Land Surface/Earth System models and hence improve simulation of regional land surface fluxes, climate and climate projections. The research method and the low order inverse modeling techniques developed in this proposal is of interest to a broad community, including physicists, applied mathematicians, meteorologists, climate scientists and hydrologists. The educational plan leverages the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) framework to engage 6-12 students from the DC metro area in STEM by engaging them in activities that will enhance their understanding of land atmosphere interaction.  We will ensure long-term sustainability of this program by developing a network of participating teachers, online resources, and program assessment and evaluation tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research program will use computed tomography (CT) scans to create anatomically accurate 3D models of healing bones.  These models will be used to measure how much healing has occurred.  The models can also detect if healing has failed. This approach uses engineering simulation tools to carry out virtual mechanical tests, which will measure the mechanical strength of the healing bone.  This will assess healing without the need for direct physical interaction with an animal or human patient.  The bone models will adapt to load-bearing just like bones behave in the body - a novel feature of this work.  These results will advance a new paradigm of non-invasive biomechanics-driven methods for measuring bone fracture healing and have impact on both science and society. The long-term benefit to society will be to develop similar tools to detect problems with bone healing much earlier than is currently possible, which may ultimately lead to better care at lower cost. The research is closely integrated with an educational outreach plan.  Outreach activities are aimed at improving the retention of women in mechanical engineering, both locally and nationally. The combined outcomes of the research and education plans will support the investigator's career in non-invasive mechanical properties measurement of bone.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to characterize the structural mechanics of bone fracture callus, an important but under-studied musculoskeletal tissue. The specific technical objectives are: (1) define and validate a scaling law for modeling the density-dependent mechanical properties of fracture callus, (2) develop a collection of multiaxial virtual mechanical tests for detecting failed bone healing (nonunion) based on organ-level rigidity and tissue-level stress concentrations, and (3) characterize the structural organization of fracture callus and measure remodeling at the bone-callus boundary as quantitative indicators of healing speed. This work will be accomplished using new image analysis algorithms, structural finite-element modeling, and high-performance computing (HPC) enabled optimization methods. In this project, we will show how routine clinical imaging can be used to quantify the mechanics, organization, and remodeling stage of a healing fracture. The methods developed through this program will have a transformative impact on the interdisciplinary community of researchers studying bone healing by enabling quantitative in vivo assessment of structural healing and definitive diagnosis of failed healing when it occurs.

On the contrary, synthetic analogs of tissues (i.e. polymeric gels) are currently not capable to control the amount of water without affecting their mechanics.  A new class of polymeric materials based on bottlebrush-macromolecular architectures is proposed here to enable independent and programmable control over gel composition and mechanical properties.  In contrast to traditional linear polymers, the bottlebrush architecture introduces a myriad of side chains or ?bristles? that afford additional molecular parameters to tune softness without changing the water fraction. Furthermore, tailoring the chemistry of side-chain ends will empower novel applications such as programmable and injectable materials for additive manufacturing of tissue-mimetic devices. The proposed novel class of polymeric gels will provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary research through integration of cutting-edge polymer chemistry, soft-matter physics, and emerging technologies that may lead to breakthroughs in many applications such as biomedical devices, tissue-engineering scaffolds, and soft robotics. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The project will address three fundamental challenges. First, the equilibrium swelling ratio and gel?s mechanical properties will be separately correlated with architectural parameters of brush-like networks such as the side chain length and grafting density. Triangulation of architecture-swelling-mechanics correlations will afford independent control over swelling, softness, and non-linear mechanical response. For example, this will create an unprecedented series of synthetic gels with the same solvent fraction, but widely different moduli varying within several orders of magnitude. The second goal is to design brush-like mesoblocks that enable solvent-free injection of tissue-mimetic elastomers. The challenge is to control curing time from seconds to days separate from mechanical properties of fully cured polymer networks. Lastly, successful implementation of goals 1 and 2 will enable a new class of bioink materials based on thermosensitive hydrogels that can inject and 3D-print objects with well-defined solvent fractions and mechanical properties. The main challenge here is to integrate controlled-temperature gelation of printed materials with the design-by-architecture objectives pursued in goals 1 and 2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we are still not able to predict the paths that water follows from precipitation to streamflow in a river, nor how long this process takes. A deeper understanding is crucial to anticipate overall water quality and supply. This is particularly true for headwater streams because their input controls the water quantity and quality of larger freshwater systems. While it is widely recognized that the flow paths water can take depend on the available catchment storage, i.e., the size of the underground ?bucket?, it is not yet possible to measure how large this storage is. This project will investigate the relationship between geology, geomorphology, and topography and storage availability, as derived from hydrologic tracers such as water stable isotopes. This investigation will enhance societal ability to adapt and ensure sustainable supply of clean water under modified hydrologic conditions, likely to occur as consequences of human activities (forest harvesting, urbanization) and climate change. Through this project a relationship with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry will be established to develop hands-on activities and to teach the general public about water availability in the context of climate change. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the temporal-spatial variability of rainfall-runoff generation in headwater streams using LiDAR derived metrics of storage potential and tracer data.

The approach will integrate water stable isotopes and electrical conductivity as tracers, hydrometric data collected by an NSF LTER site, and LiDAR in catchment-scale models to predict event transit times and storage in unmonitored locations.

The project asks three core questions: How do oil infrastructures produce and shape national space? How do infrastructures redistribute agency and imbue political projects with momentum? And how do infrastructures serve as contested sites of capital accumulation? Building on recent contributions to Science and Technology Studies, this project attempts to answer these questions using a diverse array of archival resources to examine six oil infrastructure projects. The researcher plans to publish the results of this project as peer-reviewed articles, and he will use his dissertation as the initial draft of a book monograph for academics, policymakers, and members of the general public. He also plans to use these results to reach out to policy audiences at conferences and in peer-reviewed policy venues.<br/><br/>This research on oil infrastructures promises to make novel contributions to three distinct subfields of Science and Technology Studies: History of Technology, Environmental History, and Infrastructure Studies. It shifts from a conventional focus on commodity production and consumption within environmental history and studies of extractive industries toward an analysis of the flows of energy, commodities, and capital that tie together the oil industry. It intentionally brings material and capital flows into the same analytical frame in order to provide a more complete account of the socio-technical networks that historically constituted the oil industry, and to better understand the materiality of struggles over the distribution of oil wealth. As decarbonization advances worldwide, spaces built around infrastructures designed to transport and refine oil, facilitate petroleum-powered trade, and absorb or direct flows of oil wealth will need to confront the momentum and path dependency that such infrastructures have produced, as well as looming prospects of infrastructural abandonment and capital flight. This research will aid citizens and policymakers in making historically informed decisions about energy policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Langlands program in modern mathematics has been evolving with deeper ideas since its inception. This workshop will provide an overview of recent rapid progress in the relative Langlands program and foster further development by encouraging interactions between senior and junior researchers. Given the recent exciting developments, a workshop on the subject is timely and will encourage young people to enter this very active field. <br/><br/>Langlands's principle of functoriality and the automorphic L-functions are two central themes of the Langlands program and the theory of automorphic forms. Despite more than forty years of progress and numerous breakthroughs, many questions in this program are still open and even deeper questions have arisen. The theory of endoscopy, a special but very important case of functoriality, attracted immense efforts in the past thirty years, leading to breakthroughs such as the proof of the Fundamental Lemma and the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations of classical groups. Going beyond these remarkable achievements requires new techniques and ideas. In recent years, exciting new ideas have emerged, which have the potential to renew our vision of the whole subject. The conference will focus on three main topics: (1) the relative Langlands program, (2) relations between special values of (higher) derivatives of L-functions, and (3) beyond endoscopy and possible new cases of functoriality.

Crossover youth are disproportionately likely to experience social and economic disadvantage, and the dual system involvement may fundamentally shape their adolescence and transition to adulthood. This project investigates how juvenile court institutions characterize and respond to crossover youth, how crossover youth experience their dual status as ?dependent? and ?delinquent,? and how crossover youths? experiences in court influence their well-being as they proceed through adolescence. In addition to investigating the relationship between state institutions and inequality in the United States, the project will show how the state distinguishes between victims and offenders and how it interacts with the families so affected.

There has been significant concern about the mental health of these youth, especially concerning the risk of adverse mental health events, including suicide. However, research shows that when nonconforming adolescents are well-supported, they have similar levels of depression to other adolescents. For such adolescents who seek medical intervention, these support systems may include parents as advocates and/or healthcare professionals who specialize in serving them. In these cases, decisions about steps towards intervention are made between the adolescents, their parents, as well as the physicians. Findings from this in-depth interview study will help inform healthcare professionals about ways in which medical services can improve for these adolescents. This research will also provide information for families and other stakeholders about how to advance the health and wellbeing of adolescents.  This project provides a platform for adolescents to describe their lived experiences, which can benefit the medical field and families that need their expertise.<br/><br/>Studying gender non-conforming adolescents provides researchers with the opportunity to analyze the processes that contribute to the creation of their identities.  This project will explain how non-conforming adolescents who receive medical interventions address the complexity of their identities. Data collection involves 60 in-depth, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with three groups: 20 non-conforming adolescents, 20 parents of such adolescents, and 20 physicians who work with such adolescents.  Participants in this study will be identified through a combination of personal contacts and snowball sampling. Interview questions with physicians include exploring reasons for approving or denying medical services to adolescents, how they help facilitate discussions between parents and adolescents, and ways in which healthcare for these adolescents can be improved. Interviews with the parents focus on their child?s behaviors and interactions with doctors. Questions with the adolescents will probe for reasons behind their decisions to seek information about medical intervention and their experiences with this process. Interview data will be subjected to open coding to derive themes present in the data using NVIVO to manage transcripts and data analysis. This project addresses the gap in our knowledge on the behaviors and beliefs of non-conforming adolescents and will provide insight into medical technologies to support them.

Moments of lethal force by the police remind us of the power, authority, and discretion policymakers and the public grant the police for law enforcement and public security. Those moments also raise questions about the frequency, causes, and consequences of lethal force by the police. Neither policymakers nor the public, however, know how often police o?cers use lethal force, particularly how often they shoot civilians. Media coverage, crowdsourcing, and government reports of police shootings paint an incomplete picture of lethal force in U.S. policing. It often excludes, for example, the majority of police shootings?non-fatal shootings. Furthermore, policymakers and the public know little about the civic and communal e?ects of police shootings. Accordingly, policymakers and the public need more data about incidents of police harm of civilians. They also need data-driven assessments of whether police harm of civilians negatively a?ects civic life, inclusive of public trust and participation. Collecting, cataloging, storing, and sharing comprehensive data about police shootings, fatal and non-fatal, is necessary. Higher-quality data and analyses may contribute to reducing police harm of civilians and bettering relationships between police and communities they are to serve and protect without bias.<br/><br/>    The researchers will collect data on shootings of civilians by police in the U.S. for the period 2000-2019. The primary sources of data will be the police departments of the 285 largest cities (i.e., cities of at least 100,000 residents as of the 2010 Census). The researchers will use each city?s and/or their state?s ?freedom of information? statutes to request public records of every instance of a police o?cer involved in a shooting of a civilian, both fatal and non-fatal. They also will request the dates, times, and locations of the o?cer-involved shootings, along with information about the demographics of the o?cers and civilians. As a supplement, the researchers will collect newspaper stories about the o?cer-involved shootings in the sample cities. They will code them to assess media coverage and content of the shootings. The researchers will use the data they collect to build a public repository for aggregating, hosting, and disseminating data about police shootings. Additionally, they will produce a descriptive analysis of lethal force by police. Finally, they will conduct multivariate analyses to identify whether lethal force by police harms civic engagement, including the propensity of citizen-initiated contact for emergency (911) and non-emergency (311) services from municipalities. Evaluating whether lethal use of force by the police, be it fatal or non-fatal, decreases citizen-initiated contact with local governments will inform theoretical, empirical, and public understandings of police-civilian interactions. The data, inclusive of its public dissemination, and analyses of it will better illuminate the degree to which police use lethal force and suggest how to better balance police discretion to use lethal force for public safety and order while fostering or maintaining public trust in the police, particularly by communities of color.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large amounts of carbon are delivered to inland waters as terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) in headwater streams. The type and amount of DOM in these streams controls whether that carbon is released to the atmosphere (i.e. stream respiration) or removed from the carbon cycle (i.e. transported downstream and buried). This project will determine the role of forest harvesting, and specifically clear cutting, in controlling carbon cycling and stream respiration in headwater streams. The results from this project will be used to develop predictive models that guide future research and inform management of forested headwater systems. This project will provide training for at least 2 PhD and 9 undergraduate student researchers who will gain interdisciplinary expertise in the hydrologic and biogeochemical sciences, solving problems of societal concern. Data and understanding gained in this project will be used as university class examples to discuss the linkages between land management, carbon cycling, and hydrologic response of forested ecosystems. This project will develop educational materials on watershed science that will reach nearly 6,000 K-12 students, 48 science teachers, and 40 pre-service students to enhance understanding of land cover-ecosystem interactions and knowledge of their local watersheds.<br/><br/>Inland waters have recently been highlighted for their importance in global carbon pools and fluxes relative to terrestrial and marine systems. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest fraction of organic carbon transported through stream networks, and much of this DOM enters streams in headwater forest locations. This project answers the call to ?focus on better identifying human impacts on the transport and biogeochemical cycling of carbon by inland waters? as outlined in the Second State of the Carbon Cycle Report, by: 1) Determining the role of forest harvesting in regulating DOM character in headwater streams; 2) Quantifying the influence of DOM character on stream ecosystem respiration; and 3) Identifying how components 1 and 2 interact to regulate spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem respiration across forested headwater stream networks. This information will be used to create predictions that will then be confronted with data to improve models, and expose gaps in understanding to guide future field and lab experimentation. This project will develop a vertically integrated program of mentorship, education, and provide training for undergraduate and PhD students who will gain exposure to research, outreach, and professional development activities. Through collaboration with the College of Natural Science Education and Outreach Center, this project will develop a STEM kit on watershed science specifically targeted at K-12 schools with a high percentage of underrepresented students, and encourage these groups to pursue STEM pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the concepts of red and blue states are familiar to most Americans, we have little understanding of how that patchwork emerges from the everyday processes and interactions of the people who live within it. To understand how local contexts produce the geography of American politics, this project follows three communities through the 2020 presidential campaign. These communities are similar socioeconomically, but have historically voted very differently. The three towns are similar blue-collar, Midwestern towns located in predominately rural counties, and yet they vote for opposing parties in presidential elections: one is staunchly Democratic, another is devoutly Republican, and a third has a voting history that is more mixed. What is it about these communities that influences similar people to vote differently? Findings from the project will be of interest to all political actors who have an interest in understanding and predicting voting patterns in presidential elections, as well as those interested in constructing effective political campaigns.  <br/><br/>To understand why demographically similar small towns vote differently in presidential campaigns, this project uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. Relying on Census and voting records from 1932-2016, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to identify the three cases based on their demographic similarities and their different voting histories from 1964-2016. The qualitative portion of the study will draw on three different types of data: in-depth interviews conducted with 90 voters across the three towns at four different points during the 2020 U.S. presidential election; in-depth interviews with 75 community leaders from churches, non-profits, unions, political parties, and local government; and ethnographic observation of key community organizations? mobilization efforts during the campaign. All qualitative data will be analyzed using the RQDA qualitative analysis package.   Data from the interviews and observation will demonstrate how the meso-level of organizations and community life shape voters? understandings of national politics. In answering this question, this study advances the scholarship on partisanship and polarization in American politics by re-orienting its focus away from individuals? demographics and toward the place-based processes of sense-making that help people understand the complex political world.

Some aggressors select their targets and coordinate on polarized online communities to organize attacks against their victims, inundating them with hateful or disturbing messages, videos, and images. These attacks can cause serious harm to their victims, forcing them to leave social media sites or even to contemplate self-harm. Despite the threat posed by online aggression, the problem has so far not received much attention by the computer security research community. Developing quantitative methods able to identify and mitigate such attacks is however of paramount importance to provide a safe online experience to all Internet users. This project aims to develop tools able to identify online aggression attacks in real time, allowing online services to take the appropriate countermeasures.<br/>    <br/>In this project, the PI aims to achieve four research objectives. First, by leveraging annotation from crowdsourcing workers, this project aims to develop effective corroborating evidence of aggression incidents on social media. De-identified datasets will be released publicly and will help the research community at large to better understand the problem. Second, the PI will develop techniques based on machine learning to identify online accounts that partake in online aggression, and to automatically flag the hateful content that they post, allowing online services to quickly react to such attacks. Third, the project will develop predictive models to establish the likelihood for content that is posted online to receive hate in the future; online services will be able to use these models to proactively allocate moderation resources towards content that is considered at risk. Finally, the PI will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of different mitigation approaches for this problem, from suspending offending online accounts to disabling comments for particularly risky content.

The process by which this transition occurs is through subduction initiation along continental margins. However, modern examples and numerical models of subduction initiation remain highly contentious. The late Paleozoic (ca. 450?300 million years ago) conversion of northwestern North America from a passive to an active margin is often cited as a classic example of this fundamental plate tectonic process, but very little is known about the nature and timing of key events in northern Alaska and Yukon, Canada, that led to this subduction initiation event. This study promotes collaboration between academic researchers at three U.S. institutions and government researchers at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to better inform our understanding of late Paleozoic tectonic events in a remote and understudied region of North America. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students will participate in research initiatives at each institution. In addition, the research team will collaborate with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the USGS to disseminate geologic knowledge of Arctic Alaska to the public, to enhance the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and facilitate the training of the next generation of Arctic Earth scientists.<br/><br/>Recent models for the middle Paleozoic tectonic evolution of North America (Laurentia) highlight margin-parallel transport of circum-Arctic terranes followed by widespread continental subduction initiation from the Yukon to Nevada. However, the timing, nature, and duration of middle Paleozoic orogenic events remain ambiguous. This project will focus on key structural relationships and unique Devonian?Carboniferous synorogenic sedimentary and magmatic rocks within the Arctic Alaska terrane of northern Alaska. The research consists of three major components: 1) the examination of synorogenic rocks coupled with the development of a regional provenance dataset; 2) a petrological, geochemical, and geochronological examination of regional Middle to Upper Devonian igneous rocks; and 3) a field-based structural study integrated with regional seismic datasets to reconstruct the style of Devonian?Carboniferous deformation in Arctic Alaska. This work will provide critical new insights into the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of northwestern North America and the greater circum-Arctic region to assess the viability of several subduction initiation mechanisms. In addition, this project will provide new piercing points for Mesozoic tectonic reconstructions of the Arctic, with relevance to several subdisciplines of the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While we can forecast hurricanes a few days ahead, having predictions with longer lead times is preferable for better preparation against the impending hazards. Currently, seasonal hurricane predictions are skillful at letting us know of the possible hurricane activity over the entire ocean basin. However, such forecast does not pinpoint the coastal vicinity where hurricane may strike. Over the ocean, the large-scale wind pattern consists of gyres around high atmospheric pressure centers in the subtropics (or ?subtropical highs?). This pattern evolves very slowly and can steer hurricanes toward or away from the coast. Here, the project will investigate the evolution of these subtropical highs and their connection to hurricane tracks and landfall. Emerging results may enhance seasonal hurricane forecast and help us mitigate future hurricane hazards. The project also aims to develop a future workforce that can combine weather and climate information to minimize environmental risk and improve decision making.<br/>  <br/>The research goal is to understand the co-variability between subtropical highs and hurricane landfall. The project objectives are to (1) quantify the variability of subtropical highs and hurricane landfalls globally, and (2) assess this relationship with respect to the impact land-sea temperature contrast and sea surface temperature. The investigator will analyze historical data and current climate simulations and conduct new experiments using idealized aqua-planet climate model and realistic climate models. The educational goal is to train citizens to address problems related to weather and climate.

While they have been the subject of much study, we know very little regarding how modern electoral parties emerged in our history.  Focusing on the State of New York, the pivot for the first national party system, this project provides a systematic analysis of the social and political factors that structured the actions of those individuals who built the first parties. The project investigates how they formed networks of political support that spanned across space as well as different levels of government (local, state, federal) and traces how local political elites were pulled into the emerging federal party system. Findings from the project will provide greater insight into the origins of political parties in our democracy, and help to inform our understanding of contemporary political parties through greater detail regarding their evolution. <br/><br/>While political parties were a major concern of scholars across several disciplines, answers to the question of where parties come from are still almost entirely absent. Progress in addressing this question has been stymied in part by the absence of systematic individual-level data.  This project approaches the question of party formation through two analyses that include these data. First, because in America the organization of parties was intrinsically bound up with the organization of the state and because creating a state involves office-creation, this project will first reconstruct the structure of the larger system of offices that political elites had to navigate. The project will construct a novel database of all civil, judicial, and military offices from the federal to the state and local level from 1777 to 1821 in the state of New York. Using mobility tables, vacancy chain and sequence analysis, the project investigates the emergence of political careers as meaningful sequences of offices held by individuals. This forms the backdrop for the second analysis. For a subset of 730 political elites who were active during the crucial years between the Constitutional Convention and the election of 1800, the project adds information on party affiliation, socio-demographic characteristics, and the multiple social networks in which they were embedded. Using this comprehensive dataset, the project employs a regression framework to study the factors that determined which political elites affiliated with which party.  Findings from this project will inform theories of democracy and its evolution, as well as provide an important historical portrait of individual political careers at a critical time in the development of our nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this system, credit is offered through online platforms?often unregulated? and distributed via mobile money. In economies where exchange leans heavily on close social ties, such impersonal and socially invisible sources of digital credit represent a radical break with the bases of social order. How should we understand this juncture of digital financial circuits with household economies? How do individuals come to adopt, avoid, or use digital credit amidst a dense network of socially negotiated economic relations? And, in turn, how does the introduction of technocratic relations of debt and credit reshape existing social and economic relations? This technological expansion is often framed in terms of democratized access to the global economy, and is supported by research that examines the effect of financial-technology interventions on standard economic measures such as income. While empirically valuable, such research neglects questions of how mundane technological interventions may have broader social and political consequences. This project examines how new digital infrastructures: 1) present occasions to re-arrange existing relations of exchange and negotiation in the market; and 2) enable or constrain processes of valuation, and therefore value creation, in the market. This process-oriented approach sheds light not only on current developments but also on what a technologically-mediated economic future may look like. In the way that 20th century road infrastructure still shapes collective life, how digital financial infrastructures are laid down today is likely to have far-reaching consequences. This project presents an early opportunity to examine such futures, thus providing guidance for policy-makers looking to help societies adapt to this important technological change.   <br/><br/>This project studies the case of changing relations of personal credit and debt amidst a booming digital market for household and personal finance. The project adopts a mixed methods approach using nationally representative survey data, qualitative interviews, and ethnographic observation in sequence to: 1) establish statistical findings about the current state of the digital economy, 2) examine how cultural narratives frame the deployment and adoption of digital finance, and 3) offer a processual account of how digital finance infrastructure re-orders exchange in everyday life. In partnership with local research organizations, the project first collects both self-reported data on social and economic behavior as well as digital trace data such as mobile money transaction logs from a nationally representative sample of 1,800 smartphone users. The project uses regression analysis and computational cluster analysis to identify key axes of variation along which the use of digital finance is patterned. The project then conducts up to 100 semi-structured interviews with developers and users of the new economy to examine how different cultural narratives and practices shape how digital finance is both designed and integrated into everyday life. Finally, the project conducts ethnographic observations in key urban and peri-urban sites to gather the evidence of people?s lives.  Findings from the project will contribute to sociological theories regarding the operation of financial markets and the effects of technological change on exchange relationships within the context of a changing global economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cutting edge research in cognitive science and artificial intelligence requires interdisciplinary training that is not available at all universities, especially those that serve minorities typically under-represented in research. The Language, Cognition, and Computation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Stanford University aims to address this challenge. It provides talented undergraduates from diverse backgrounds with an opportunity to do mentored cognitive science research in top laboratories, paired with a supportive program framework that includes technical training, professional development, and academic discussion. The goals of this program are to: 1. Train the next generation of researchers in the study of language, computation, and cognition; 2. Help promising students discover the excitement and value of research; 3. Develop new, innovative, ambitious student-led projects in member labs; and 4. Support the interdisciplinary cognitive science research community at Stanford and beyond.<br/><br/>Cognitive science and its core disciplines ? psychology, linguistics, and computer science ? are seeing a major convergence around themes of uncertainty and learning. As psychology and linguistics are becoming more computational, computation is returning to its cognitive roots. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the recent artificial intelligence boom: AI techniques developed in psychology decades ago have undergone a resurgence in machine learning. Students in the REU program will contribute to research in these areas through mentored research via cognitive experiments with adults and children, theoretical development, use of artificial intelligence models, and statistical analysis of pre-existing datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond the tragic health toll of this outbreak, there has been increased targeting of minority groups of U.S. residents.  The Coronavirus outbreak has refueled stereotypes (e.g., eating ?strange? foods, having unsanitary lifestyles, being disease-ridden) that are veiled under health-related fears. Racial discrimination significantly decreases well-being and increases psychological distress as well as mental and physical health. Most studies on the effects of racism on identity, resilience, and parental socialization, have focused on discrimination among adolescents and emerging adults. This innovative interdisciplinary study will significantly advance our understanding of risk and resilience in response to acute social stress among families with children in three different age groups, early childhood (4-7 years), middle childhood (8-11 years) and early-to-mid adolescence (12-15 years). Findings will identify key developmental and social processes that influence how identities of racial minority parents and their children are formed. The influence of an acute but prolonged threat to their social identities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak may provide insight into the general nature of this process as well. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary team comprising a cultural developmental scientist, a school psychologist, and a computer scientist will study multiple forms of COVID-19 racial discrimination and the subsequent impact on the identity development and adjustment of minority parents and children. The study will focus on how parents socialize their children about issues of race and identity in reaction to this event at the early part of 2020 and again 6-9 months later. Protective factors for adjustment in parents and children will also be identified. In addition, large scale texts of outbreak-related social media (Twitter) posts will be analyzed to account for how public opinion, anxiety, and discriminatory attitudes evolve with the peaking and fading of this epidemic and provide objective indicators of the larger public social discourse climate across the year.  Infectious diseases will continue to emerge and re-emerge globally, and their negative impact on psychological and social health is understudied but highly significant, leading to both significant social and economic consequences. Knowledge from this research may help inform the types of services and education that can promote well-being in targeted marginalized groups and the larger public during future similar events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An organism?s DNA can be separated into two categories: coding DNA, which has the directions for how to build proteins ? the molecular machines of the cell, and non-coding DNA, which has many functions including the instructions for when, where, and how much protein should be built. The majority of the human genome is non-coding DNA, and its proper functioning is essential for life. This project aims to decipher some of the rules that govern function of non-coding DNA in the innate immune response to infection and to compare these rules to non-coding DNA needed for other biological processes. Success will give scientists specific information about how non-coding DNA orchestrates the immune response and a deeper understanding about how a large part of the genome functions in general. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate and be trained in the work. This project also includes a broader impacts plan to improve quantitative literacy among biology undergraduate and graduate students, which will better equip them for modern jobs that increasingly require quantitative skills.<br/><br/>Virtually every biological process, from development to immunity, is controlled by a gene regulatory network (GRN), a network of signaling molecules and transcription factors that control gene expression. Years of work have uncovered how the sequence of regulatory DNA, e.g. promoters and enhancers, can specify a GRN?s function. This work largely has focused on developmental GRNs, which are uniquely constrained by evolution: selection favors GRNs that drive a stereotyped developmental program in spite of perturbations. To decipher which principles of developmental GRNs translate to lesser studied non-developmental GRNs, which have diverse functions and are subject to different evolutionary pressures, this project will study the Drosophila innate immunity GRN. In Aim 1, allele-specific RNA-seq will be used to characterize the natural variation in transcriptional response to infection between D. melanogaster lines. These data will allow the identification of genes whose expression variation is driven by changes in regulatory DNA. Comparisons of the pattern of expression variation using different infection conditions will be made. In Aim 2, in vivo and in vitro functional genomics assays will be used to identify immune-responsive enhancers and to generate sequence-to-function models of these enhancers. Additional experiments will validate and refine the models of enhancer function. The project also includes a plan to implement problem-based learning of numerical literacy components into a large, undergraduate class, which will improve the quantitive skills of biology students and be disseminated for use by others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical approach of representing data as blocks of information bits falls short of addressing diverse requirements, including scalability, efficiency, and reliability, of the next generation storage, computation, and communication systems. This project develops an alternative paradigm for transmission of data across massively connected wireless networks by proposing methods to embed the information into mathematical constructs called subspaces (i.e., linear-algebraic objects in a vector space), via a technique called subspace coding. While these structures capture the essence of gathered data in a wide range of signal processing applications, fundamental limits of compression as well as practical and universal techniques to attain these limits are not understood. This project characterizes a natural duality between error correction and compression in the subspace domain and proposes to leverage this connection in order to develop explicit and efficient compression mechanisms for massive data sets that exhibit certain properties. This interdisciplinary project is tied with an education plan and provides a stimulating and innovative research environment for students at all levels. Furthermore, workshops are developed as part of an active outreach program in order to introduce high school students to concepts in fields related to data science and communications, exposing them to careers essential to tomorrow?s workforce.<br/><br/>Wireless networks are rapidly growing in size, are becoming more hierarchical, and are becoming increasingly distributed. Conventional methods including channel estimation of point-to-point links and block coding do not properly scale with the size of such massive networks. This project proposes that subspace coding in the analog domain becomes relevant for conveying information across networks in such a scenario. Furthermore, the dual problem in the compression domain is central to a wide range of applications involving large-scale raw data, often exhibiting low-dimensional structures, which require techniques for low-dimensional subspace recovery and dimensionality reduction. The specific objectives of this project are summarized as follows: (1) Provide a comprehensive framework, including a certain metric space and an analog operator channel, to study coding for wireless networks in a non-coherent fashion; (2) Construct subspace codes for analog operator channels and characterize their performance; (3) Develop techniques for low-rank subspace recovery given constrained observations; (4) Characterize fundamental limits on compression of low-rank matrices and leverage the duality with subspace codes to design explicit compression mechanisms; (5) Develop schemes for subspace-coded distributed computation to efficiently compute the outcome of algorithms operating over matrices and subspaces while minimizing the delay.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While migration scholarship has proliferated in attempt to better understand these dynamics, the field has overlooked one of the major factors reshaping landscapes: wildfires. The first aim of this project is to describe how wildfires affect migration patterns in the United States. The second aim is to examine the role of the built environment in mediating whether and how wildfire damage impacts migration patterns. It is well-established that housing access plays a crucial role in determining disaster recovery; initial damage to homes influences whether or not a household is displaced, and reconstruction or the availability of alternative housing is a major factor that affects longer-term return migration. Greater attention to the built environment can therefore improve scholars? understanding of not just whether fires may influence migration, but how they may do so. The core topics investigated by this research ? disaster displacement and post-disaster housing access - are immediately relevant to policymakers working in emergency management settings and to municipal and state officials working in regions at high fire risk, thus providing important input into policy and preparedness in these jurisdictions.  <br/><br/>This study utilizes mixed-methods to examine questions of disaster preparedness from wildfires at multiple scales, and will involve three primary components. First, difference-in-difference econometric and network approaches will be used to analyze the relationships between fire damage and mobility patterns at a national scale. Data sources include the Internal Revenue Service?s County-to-County Migration Data, Arizona State University?s Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States, and the U.S. National Incident Management System. Second, qualitative fieldwork in Butte County, California - including 50 semi-structured interviews and participant observation - will be used to illustrate from the ground-level how individuals and families navigated post-disaster housing access in the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire. This fieldwork will further examine what factors facilitated and what factors prevented return migration and post-fire reconstruction. Third, geospatial analysis of satellite imagery will be used to describe and quantify post-fire building reconstruction rates, which will in turn be compared between four major fire sites. Data sources include Microsoft?s U.S. Building Footprint Data, the multi-agency Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database, and remote sensing images from DigitalGlobe. This research will contribute to a growing body of sociological theory on threats to the built environment by blending social and environmental data, incorporating spatial methods, and drawing from literatures on migration and urban environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This prevents the effective imaging, diagnosis and treatment of deadly brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s disease and brain cancer. As such, there is a tremendous demand for delivery systems which can solve these problems and effectively treat brain disease. Natural materials such as ferritin proteins have been shown to self-assemble into nanocages and cross the blood-brain barrier. However, a complete understanding of how these nanocages move across the barrier into the brain as well as their structure-function relationships has remained elusive. This research project will combine bioengineering and chemical approaches to understand how these nanostructures interact with the blood-brain barrier and to  rationally design nanocages which have the capability to cross blood-brain barriers and to achieve cellular delivery. The project will provide a robust nanoparticle tool to study nanomaterial-biological barrier interactions and will advance the science for the development of next generation brain drug delivery and imaging platforms and techniques. This project brings together several key technology areas, including nanomaterials, chemical engineering, cell biology and biomedical engineering, providing interdisciplinary training for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students as well as exposing students from local high schools to cutting-edge research. <br/><br/>The central goal of the research project is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of protein based nanocage/blood-brain barrier interactions using ferritin as a model protein and subsequently to use this knowledge to develop a novel family of protein nanocages as brain targeted, modular delivery platforms with additional functionalities available on demand. The central hypothesis is that with rational design, the engineered ferritin protein can maintain its ability to assemble into nanocages, cross the biological interface of the blood-brain barrier, and also be conferred with new abilities for targeted delivery, loading of therapeutics and/or imaging agents. The research project seeks to: 1) design and genetically introduce targeting domains to ferritin proteins, assemble the ferritin proteins into ferritin nanocages, 2) investigate the nanocages? blood-brain barrier traversing and cellular targeting capabilities using cellular models; and 3) study the nanocage structure-biological function relationship. The scope of the project includes probing protein nanocage interactions with biological systems to elucidate the genetically-directed nanoscale modular design and providing theragnostic data on the potential treatment of many brain diseases. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a genetically designed and chemically engineered nanoscale delivery system which can deliver therapeutic and diagnostic agents across the impenetrable blood-brain barrier.  Overall, the experiments will probe nanoscale transport mechanisms and explore the interactions between engineered nanocages and biological systems, therefore laying the foundation for design and production of a new paradigm of protein-based theranostic systems. The educational components of this proposal will involve youth from underrepresented groups with a goal to attract, inspire and train the next generation of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental social and biological fact about human beings is that where people live shapes who they become, and their health and economic prospects in particular. The reasons for this are still not fully understood but one key reason is that people do not live on their own; relationships to others give rise to face-to-face social networks, and these social connections generally occupy the same places. Research has established the connections between networks and place, and between networks and health, but this doctoral dissertation research project explores the intersection of all three (people in networks in places).  Results may help practitioners and decision makers create new ways of thinking about geographically contextualized networks and new ways of addressing important public health concerns.<br/><br/>This research uses extremely detailed data on 24,812 individuals in 176 communities in a setting in which people live in close proximity to members of their social networks.  Statistical methods such as multilevel models are employed to answer a variety of questions related to networks, geography, and health. The researcher investigates the following questions: 1) Is network centrality associated with geographic centrality and how do these locations impact health? 2) Are negative ties between individuals spatially patterned such that individuals ?keep their enemies closer? than their friends, and how does this proximity influence health? 3) Using the ecological concept of ?ecotones,? do individuals in particular locations experience higher variability in health outcomes?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will bring together a wide range of researchers in the field from across both continents and highlight a number of exciting directions in representation theory, an active area of research with deep connections to geometry, number theory and physics. The organizers have invited fifteen leaders in the field to give lectures that will be shown at both sites simultaneously, live on one continent and on the other by video conferencing. Due to the time difference, the morning in Europe and afternoon in North America are not suitable for shared talks, and during this time, there will be local talks given by junior researchers and time for discussion and collaboration.  The double location format is designed to lower the travel costs and carbon footprint of the conference while still encouraging international collaboration.  NSF funds will be used to support ten to fifteen researchers who are early-career or from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences to attend the conference at the North American site.<br/><br/>The invited speakers represent a wide range of areas falling within the topic of geometric representation theory and the conference will aim to facilitate interaction between these groups and between the two locations.

Policy analysts and donor organizations have portrayed microcredit as an inclusive solution to poverty.

Diagnostic tests are imperfect and treatments are sometimes ineffective.  As a result, avoidance of exposure to the infected ticks that transmit the disease-causing bacteria is critical to protecting the public from this insidious disease.  Avoidance of Lyme disease, in turn, requires knowing where and when infected ticks are expected to be abundant and risk therefore high.  The continuation of these studies will allow researchers to better understand the effects of predators as well as environmental variation on mice populations, in order to predict long-term changes in risk of exposure to tick-borne diseases. The research will predict disease risk and will communicate this to the public, through multiple media outlets. The research team will continue to serve on relevant public policy boards at the local, state, and federal levels. <br/><br/>	Previous research has revealed that high abundance of acorns in the fall stimulates population growth of white-footed mice, resulting in high mouse density the following summer. Newly hatched larval ticks feed more successfully, and acquire pathogens more efficiently, from mice than from other hosts. Larval ticks feeding from abundant mice the summer following a high acorn year molt into nymphs one year later, resulting in high density of infected nymphs, and therefore high risk of Lyme disease, two summers following mast production.  The investigators propose to continue research at six core study sites to maintain long-term data on: 1. Acorn and other tree seed production; 2. Population dynamics of mice, chipmunks, squirrels, and deer; 3. Population dynamics of larval, nymphal, and adult blacklegged ticks; 4. Infection prevalence of ticks with zoonotic pathogens; 5. Tick responses to specific climatic variables; and 6. Occurrence of predators and dilution hosts.  Despite the predictability of Lyme-disease risk from past acorn production, new patterns and questions have recently emerged.  Thus, five central objectives will be pursued: 1. Integrating host-seeking and attached tick subpopulations to develop full models of tick population dynamics under conditions of environmental variability;  2. Establishing a mechanistic basis for modeling climate effects on Lyme disease risk;  3. Determining long-term trends in tree seed production as a consequence of changes in climate, ontogeny, and the relative abundance of species;  4. Understanding top-down effects of mouse predators on rodent-tick interactions; and 5. Develop and iteratively evaluate forecasts for Lyme disease risk from the component parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet job quality in these occupations remains low, with median wages stagnating near $11 per hour and worker rights violations commonplace. Such work conditions exacerbate a mounting home health care labor shortage and deepen gender and racial inequality, given that women and people of color are disproportionately employed in this sector. The labor shortage, in turn, hinders labor force participation among those, particularly women, who provide care to elderly and the young. As governmental and non-governmental actors seek to improve these conditions, one key challenge they confront is that of implementing labor standards?a difficult task in the context of atomized workplaces, intimate labor processes, and ambiguous employer-employee relations. This study examines regulatory efforts to overcome those challenges and translate labor standards on paper into improved working conditions. The findings will provide evidence of when and how such efforts impact worker outcomes and will inform policymakers as they work to address this unfolding crisis in paid care work.<br/><br/>This study focuses on two regulatory forces in the U.S.?labor unions and government-civil society collaborations?and their impacts on employer compliance, workers? ability to claim their rights, and resulting work conditions in home-based care work. The research involves an individual-level analysis of original survey data, and a comparative analysis of New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Survey data provide indicators of worker outcomes across cities, with participants recruited primarily through targeted digital advertisements. Variations in these outcomes will be explained through analysis of public records, administrative data, and 120 qualitative interviews with workers, employers, and policy actors. In addition to the cross-city comparison, outcomes will be measured at two points in time in Seattle, before and after the initial implementation of new domestic worker regulations. Findings will demonstrate whether and how unions and government-civil society partnerships affect labor standards enforcement in the context of in-home care work. In doing so, the project informs sociological theories of paid care work and workplace regulation, advancing knowledge about the conditions under which policy change translates into substantive change in worker outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to build a better understanding of the barriers that women face when they experience harassment. Specifically, it tests whether women who speak out against harassment are negatively stereotyped and therefore disadvantaged at work.  A better understanding of these barriers can help women strategize how to best navigate existing biases when they wish to speak out against harassment. Findings can also be used by organizations to craft policies that take into account the barriers to speaking out against harassment. Finally, this research can be used to educate the general public about the subtle biases that women face when they confront or speak out against harassment in order to influence cultural beliefs about harassment and erode biases. <br/><br/>Some individuals experience harassment at work, and we know little about how speaking out against harassment can exacerbate workplace inequality.  This project uses two online survey experiments to test for possible discrimination against women who speak out against harassment. In Study 1, (run on YouGov, N=1,000) the project will use a conjoint experiment to test whether a woman who does not fit the cultural archetype of the ?ideal? harassment target in various ways ? for example, a Black or Latina woman, or a woman who had previously been in a relationship with her harasser ? may be negatively stereotyped and therefore viewed as less employable. The project will use statistical tests, including t-tests and regression analyses, to determine whether variations in a harassment target?s identity and story influence her perceived employability, and will use formal mediation analysis to test whether any differences are mediated by perceptions of her. In Study 2 (run on Amazon Mechanical Turk, N=580), the project will examine how a different form of speaking out against harassment ? confronting the person who instigated unwanted behavior ? may also cause women to be negatively stereotyped and penalized on employment outcomes. This project will analyze the double bind that women who experience harassment may face when they consider speaking out against it. Although speaking out may help to limit the harassing behavior, it may simultaneously damage the employment outcomes of many women who do so.  This project advances sociological theories of labor market inequality by linking harassment to perceptions of employability. It also contributes  more broadly to theories regarding gender inequality at work and in society more generally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results will provide information about how microplastics get transported from their sources to the ocean and how fast they accumulate in sediments. With a better understanding of microplastic accumulation, more reliable computer models can be constructed to predict how sediment layers are generated as well as the future distribution of microplastics and their impact in the coastal environment.

Microplastics will be identified through fluorescence microscopy after staining with a lipid soluble fluorescent dye. Chronostratigraphic data already available on these cores will be used to constrain age estimates and allow quantitative comparison of microplastic accumulation during the last century.  In particular, the following hypotheses will be tested: a) vertically-integrated concentrations of microplastics differ for samples collected nearby large urban environments (e.g., cities) vs. those collected in open ocean, with concentrations increasing as we get closer to cities; and b) microplastic concentrations began accumulating around 1950 and have been increasing at an exponential rate over the past few decades.

This project will examine how suicide survivors construct cultural narratives to make meaning of their suicide experiences in order to inform suicide prevention strategies, clinical approaches to working with suicidal populations, and post-suicide social supports. We know that variation in social statuses, such as social class, gender and race, are related to increases in suicide risk. This project will analyze such variations in survivors? cultural narratives. The identification of social mechanisms underlying suicidality will help policy makers: 1) create and refine suicide prevention by understanding the unique circumstances that precede survivors? suicide experiences; 2) design policy to help those who have suicidal experiences transition back to life and society by identifying their unique circumstances and needs following suicide experiences; and 3) refine clinicians? approaches to suicidal populations by explaining variation within the suicidal population across social identities. If, as evidence suggests, suicide survivors? experiences and cultural narratives vary across social positions then these findings will have the potential to contribute to tailored suicide prevention policy and post-suicide programming, which could both save lives from suicide and improve survivors? quality of life post-suicide experience. <br/> <br/>Understanding how people experience surviving suicide is critical to enhance suicide prevention efforts as well as to proving support to suicide survivors. Using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 120 suicide survivors, this project will examine how individuals? social identities?and the salience of those identities?affect how they make sense of their suicide experiences and how these framings relate to their transitions back to life after periods of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt(s). Interview data will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach with Max QDA, a software program that allows for sorting, coding, and organizing narrative interview data. Given the paucity of qualitative work on suicide, this project is both methodologically and theoretically novel. The qualitative approach will advance contemporary sociological theory about suicide and provide information about the social mechanisms through which social categories relate to suicide experiences. More broadly the project contributes to sociological theories related to health disparities that vary by social status.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Soil is an important structural, living, and dynamic substrate supporting human activities and natural processes worldwide. Current systems in place for monitoring and documenting soil conditions do not provide an accurate picture of how soil is changing over time with respect to degradation, erosion, fertility, capacity for retaining water, and other properties. Nor do our current monitoring systems capture the interactions of soil with natural (weather, climate, and fire) and anthropogenic forces, such as land management. To achieve a better understanding of those interactions and outcomes, a robust, longitudinal, multi-location dataset is needed that records chemical, physical, and biological soil attributes, and that is coupled to data on environmental and climatic conditions as well as land use activities. Conceiving of such a broad and diverse dataset requires thoughtful consideration of methods for collecting uniform data and appropriate indicators for different soil attributes and the forces that interact with soils. Also necessary is a practical consideration of the specific requirements of potential users of such a database who are likely to include scientists from many disciplines, from microbiologists to ecosystem modelers, as well as practical users, like farmers.  <br/><br/>A steering committee will be appointed by the National Academies to identify appropriate experts and stakeholders to participate in the workshop. To explore the requirements of a dynamic information system, workshop discussions will be organized around several topics, including: defining appropriate, measurable indicators of chemical, physical, and especially biological soil properties; identifying the availability of complementary datasets [including those provided by the NSF National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)] that reflect environmental conditions and land management activities to overlay soil data; available technologies and methods to facilitate the timely and cost-effective collection of soil and environmental data; conceptual and practical considerations for database design, data storage, and data stewardship; and, tools to deliver information at different scales of resolution to meet the needs of a diversity of users, including land managers, farmers, academic, state and federal scientists, and policymakers.  The workshop reflects several of the science and technology priorities identified in the 2016 Framework for a Federal Strategic Plan for Soil Science and addresses information gaps noted by the 2015 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Status of the World Soils report with respect to information about changes in soil characteristics over time in North America (and particularly in the United States).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These complex traits include multiple components, so they are unlikely to be shaped by a single gene.  Recent evidence from insects, birds, plants, and fungi suggests that many different complex traits may be controlled by common genetic structures called supergenes, which lock together two or more genes with coordinated actions so that beneficial combinations are transmitted together to offspring.  In this study, the researchers will investigate characteristics of a supergene that controls social organization in a group of ants.  The project will specifically ask about how an ancient supergene changes in form and function in a group of related species.  In addition to expanding the current knowledge of how complex traits emerge and persist, this study will also provide new insights into the causes and consequences of alternative social strategies in ants.  Students will participate in every aspect of this study, and the research team will participate in outreach events to raise community awareness about entomology.  Undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience in contemporary genomics techniques, both in the classroom and as research assistants.  Graduate students will compile existing knowledge about the causes and consequences of alternative social strategies across all social organisms, which will broaden the scope of the discoveries from this project.<br/><br/>Social organization involving cooperation among non-relatives has originated repeatedly in social insects, yet the proximate and ultimate drivers of this transition remain enigmatic.  The proposed research will build upon the recent discovery of an ancestral supergene composed of about 500 linked genes that underlies social structure in multiple socially polymorphic Formica ant species. Emerging evidence suggests that supergenes commonly control complex traits, from mimetic coloration in butterflies to mating strategies in birds, but scientists are only beginning to understand the characteristics and dynamics of these genomic structures.  This project will address in parallel two major questions: how do autosomal supergenes evolve and persist, and how and why do societies composed of non-relatives repeatedly evolve.  Aim 1 will investigate whether alternative supergene variants undergo changes in gene content, gene order, and protein coding sequence as they persist in speciating lineages.  Undergraduate researchers will be trained in genomics and bioinformatics techniques and will lead intraspecific analyses of their own Formica species.  In complement, aim 2 will examine how supergene genotype influences individual- and colony-level traits.  Students in introductory biology classes will participate in data collection for this aim.  Finally, aim 3 will determine whether the distribution of social organization and genetic control varies along biogeographic axes.  A graduate student seminar will broaden discoveries from this aim by conducting a meta-analysis of ecological drivers of social polymorphism across social insects. This project will provide excellent learning opportunities for students at all levels and is poised to expand the understanding of social evolution and the genetics of complex traits.<br/><br/>This work is being funded jointly by the Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are several limitations of the current cybersecurity risk analysis methods. First, cyber risk is often treated as an information technology problem rather than a vital part of enterprise risk management. Another deficiency of the cyber risk analysis methods is the insufficiency of the utilized metrics to support investment decisions. Qualitative metrics and operational terms are often used as cyber risk indicators rather than quantified financial measures that guide investment decisions. Besides these, the lack of quantification of how investments in specific controls change risk level is another limitation of the current cyber risk analysis methods. This project aims to develop a probabilistic quantitative cybersecurity risk analysis model to relate asset-level risk to organizational-level risk and supply chain level risk to respond to the aforementioned deficiencies of the current cyber risk analysis methods. The results from this research enables effective and accurate supply-chain cyber risk assessment, which, in turn, increases economic competitiveness by enabling more effective and efficient mitigation of cyber risks and well-informed cybersecurity investments. The project provides training opportunities for students at different levels and from under-represented groups. Education materials developed in the project will be shared nationally through the National Security Agency supported CLARK repository of cybersecurity learning objects.<br/><br/>The main research problem of this study is what kind of a probabilistic quantitative cybersecurity risk analysis model can be developed to relate asset-level risk to organizational-level risk and supply chain level risk. This project employs probabilistic attack graphs, which are based on known vulnerabilities in computer software and network topologies. The dynamic risk assessment capabilities are augmented in the attack graph using Bayesian Belief Networks. A graph-theoretical functional dependency model is also developed to model the ripple effects of cyber-attacks on enterprise missions to failures in supply-chains.

For example, with 360-degree videos, users can view the scene from any orientation; with volumetric videos, users can control not only the view orientation but also the camera position. Such highly immersive content has applications in entertainment, medicine, education, manufacturing, and e-commerce, to name just a few areas. However, current video streaming infrastructure cannot fully support these emerging formats? high bandwidth, low latency, and high storage requirements. This project aims to address challenges in efficient transmission and storage of immersive video streams by proposing new, efficient representations of this content. These representations can both be adapted to fit users? viewing behaviors and can be generated at the low-latencies required for real-time streaming applications. If successful, the proposed research will enable higher quality immersive streaming than is possible with current systems, further enabling useful immersive streaming experiences. <br/><br/>This project investigates techniques for improving efficiency of two specific immersive streaming applications. For real-time 360-degree video, the project will build a system to generate area-of-focus projections in real-time. These area-of-focus projections are selected to align the high-quality focus area with a predicted user view. Low-latency generation is achieved using graphics processing units at nearby edge or cloud servers. For volumetric video streaming, this project aims to create both a storage- and bandwidth-efficient representation of the video. The representation consists of both area-of-focus versions of the video at a selected set of points within the volume as well as patches to cover dis-occluded pixels, allowing high-quality video to be delivered to users positioned anywhere in the scene. The proposed system further uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2) transmission approach to support bandwidth-efficient delivery of this representation. To more precisely measure the user?s true experience of immersive streams, this project will also create immersive video streaming datasets and investigate a new quality metric. This new metric will use novel approaches to correlate user-perceived qualities with visual artifacts introduced due to encoding and network transmission. <br/><br/>Artifacts produced as a result of this project, including publications, code, and datasets, will be made publicly available at http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~yaoliu/ImmersiveStreaming/.

For decades, scholars assumed the access to justice crisis was created by a shortage of lawyers or lawyers' unaffordability, but more recent research shows that the main reason people seek no assistance is that they do not think of their problems as ?legal.? The failure to seek solutions to civil justice problems has long-term consequences, including income loss, stress, damage to relationships, and tolls on mental and physical well-being.  While we know quite a bit about which Americans experience which civil justice problems, we know less about why this is so, and do not yet understand the social processes that underlie various groups? approaches to these problems.  Investigating civil justice problems from the perspective of people who are experiencing them will allow us to design more effective solutions to common justice problems?solutions tailored to how different groups actually think about law. <br/> <br/>This project will shed new light on the United States access to justice crisis by uniting theoretical questions at the core of socio-legal studies and applied questions at the core of access to justice research.  Two data collection components will be used to understand how people approach seven common justice problems.  The first phase will use a survey design to understand the connections between demographic characteristics such as race, class, and gender and the problem-solving routes people consider.  The second phase will use a series of in-depth interviews with a broad cross-section of people over time in a medium-sized U.S. city who are currently experiencing, or have recently experienced, one of these key justice problems.

These identities can be used to empower or disenfranchise individuals and communities based on social milieu. Disruptions to social environments initiated by changing demographics (migration) or political upheaval can transform the social significance of these identities. Within this broad context and under the supervision of Dr. Margaret Judd of the University of Pittsburgh, doctoral candidate Deborah Neidich will investigate the impact of human mobility on identity construction following a period sociopolitical turmoil. This project contributes to the body of research regarding material signifiers of identity and the relationship between cultural processes and biology; it may also point to the origins of historically recognized groups that emerged during sociopolitical change. This is particularly important as it may serve as a historical analogy to modern sociopolitical issues regarding contemporary migration by highlighting a diverse history that was forged by migrations and migrants. The information obtained through this research will be the foundation for Ms Neidich?s dissertation and available electronically as well as in a series of academic publications.<br/><br/>Ms. Neidich will use a range of sources including the skeletal biological profile (age, sex, and chemical markers of mobility) and skeletal evidence for biological stress and diet. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen adds a dietary signature, while grave goods analysis provides information concerning status and gender. Combined, the data can identify salient social categories to answer the following three questions: (1) Which aspects of a person?s identity were important for a community to mark at a person?s burial? (2) Were social disparities expressed as differences in health, trauma and diet, related to identity in the past? (3) Was there a shift in the perception of these categories during political change and periods of stability?

The realm of DL applications constantly expands, now including autonomous vehicles, robotic-assisted surgery, medical imaging, and many others. A wide societal acceptance of such technologies relies on the ability of humans to understand and trust them. Unfortunately, the exceptional practical effectiveness of DL systems is not coupled with a comprehensive theory to explain how they operate and why they are so successful on real-world data. This state of affairs obstructs a wider deployment of AI for the applications described above. To alleviate this impasse, this project seeks to open the hood of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that enable DL and elucidate how information is processed in these systems. Doing so would make the decisions of AI mechanisms more transparent to end users and other stakeholders, thus contributing to their understanding. Via rigorous performance guarantees, this project also aims to characterize the circumstances under which deep learning system are warranted not to fail. These advances will set the stage for the integration of high-performance AI systems in our daily lives, unlocking their invaluable potential impact.<br/>  <br/>The project tackles key challenges in DL theory via a novel information-theoretic approach. The main objective is to shed light on the process by which DNNs progressively build representations --- from crude and over-redundant representations in shallow layers, to highly-clustered and interpretable ones in deeper layers --- and to give the designer more control over that process. To that end, three synergistic thrusts are pursued. First is developing novel complexity measures of internal representations by quantifying the flow of information through the DNN. Crucially, these measures are designed for efficient computation over layer dimensionalities typical to state-of-the-art networks for computer vision, speech, and text processing. The second thrust focuses on relating the developed complexity measures to the generalization capability of the network via new instance-dependent generalization bounds. The goal here is to provide performance guarantees for a given DNN in terms of efficiently computable figures of merit. Lastly, the developed machinery is further leveraged to construct tools for pruning redundant neurons/layers, visualizing the DNN's operation, and progressing DNN interpretability. Altogether, this research strives to progress the current uncertain trial-and-error process of DNN design towards the domain of deterministic engineering practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geologic faults can be saturated by fluids like water which affect the frictional resistance to sliding, hence the size and timing of earthquakes. Fluid pressure within the fault zone, an important parameter, is controlled by the production and migration of that fluid.  It is critical to quantify the effects of fluids on fault sliding to better assess earthquake hazards. Here, the researchers use and develop state-of-the-art computer simulations to model earthquakes on faults that are thought to have active fluid flow along them, like the San Andreas fault.  The project focuses on fluid migration and changes in pressure and frictional resistance.  Its outcomes have relevance to naturally occurring earthquakes, as well as to induced seismicity; these latter earthquakes are triggered by human activities that involve injection or extraction of fluids from the Earth. The project also provides support to a female graduate student and training to undergraduate students. The developed modeling software will be released with an open-source license for use by the scientific community.<br/><br/>Earthquake sequence simulations capture the slow tectonic loading, aseismic slip, earthquake nucleation, and rupture propagation. They are becoming major tools to study earthquake processes and interpret observations. Fault strength is the product of a rate-and-state friction coefficient and the effective normal stress (total normal stress minus pore pressure). In this project, pore pressure is determined using a fault-zone fluid-transport model, rather that set a priori as is typically done. Fluids ascend through the crust in a fault zone whose permeability varies in time; it decreases interseismically from healing and sealing processes and increases from cracking and dilatancy during fault slip.  This behavior is called ""fault valving."" Preliminary simulations reveal fault valving behavior with earthquake recurrence influenced by cyclic overpressure build-up and release. The fluids model is here merged into a thermomechanical earthquake sequence framework. It accounts for the transition from localized frictional sliding to distributed viscous flow at depth using a temperature-dependent power law. Temperature obeys the heat equation with frictional and viscous shear heating that create a thermal anomaly along the fault and its viscous root. The model is generalized to a poroviscoelastic framework that accounts for creep closure of pores, thermal expansion of fluids (and pores), and fluid pressurization. The system behavior is quantified in terms of dimensionless ratios of relevant time scales, such as earthquake recurrence interval, healing/sealing time scale, and pore pressure diffusion time across the seismogenic depth. Outcomes of the simulations predict crustal deformations, seismic and aseismic slip patterns, heat flow, stress profiles, and other features which can be compared to geophysical data and geological observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It features a large number of presentations by graduate students and female mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>While modern mathematics now encompasses a vast range of topics, dynamical systems and differential equations have retained their central role because of the wide variety of applications ranging from the traditional areas of physics and engineering to the more recently developed and growing applications in biology, chemistry, ecology, physiology, economics and finance. Thus, the study of differential equations and dynamical systems has been a core component in our understanding of many natural phenomena. The program includes over 90 special sessions, that cover a variety of topics such as: data science, Navier-Stokes equations and fluid mechanics, topological and variational methods, mathematics of chemotaxis, biological systems analysis, progress on the n-body problem, and stochastic partial differential equations, among others.

The shortage of computer science instruction in rural schools is a serious gap in the STEM education pipeline.  To help fill this gap, this project seeks to define the skills and knowledge that teachers need so they can provide students with effective computer science learning experiences.  It will also identify local resources that can help achieve this goal.  In addition, it will collect data about challenges that must be overcome to increase the number and diversity of middle- and high-school computer science teachers.  The leadership potential of rural, high-need school systems will also be assessed. The project intends to use the results of this capacity building project to design a computer science master teacher endorsement track within an existing Master of Education degree program. <br/><br/>This project at Mercer University includes partnerships with Wiregrass Georgia Technical College and these rural county school districts:  Ben Hill, Bleckley, Evans, Jeff Davis, Tattnall, Treutlen, and Wheeler.  Additional partners are Rural Education Service Agencies (RESA):  Coastal Plains RESA, Heart of Georgia RESA, and Okefenokee RESA.  Project goals include the following:  1. Conduct a needs assessment to determine the infrastructure needed to support computer science instruction in rural school systems.  The needs assessment will also collect data about the interest among exemplary and certified grades 6-12 STEM teachers to pursue computer science teaching and leadership opportunities. 2. Investigate recruitment, preparation, and support processes pertinent to computer science teaching and leadership.  3. Design a computer science master teacher endorsement track within an existing Master of Education degree program.  This endorsement track will be based on understandings developed through activities aligned with the project?s first two project goals. Data will be collected via interviews and publicly available documents.  The data will be analyzed using grounded theory to identify the infrastructure needed to support computer science teacher and leader development.  The data analysis also aims to determine teacher interest and recruitment capacity for a computer science teacher leader endorsement program, computer science teacher leader preparation, and ongoing support. The intellectual merit of the project resides in the process of evidence-based decision making that will be used to design a model computer science teacher endorsement track. The project?s broader impacts include its potential to increase computer science learning opportunities for students in South Georgia rural, high-need school systems. Dissemination of project findings will occur via: paper presentations at state and national conferences; reports to the state RESA directors and school superintendents; a written summary sent to state legislators, the State Superintendent of Education, and the Offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor; and manuscripts submitted to journals for publication. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A multisided platform facilitates interactions between two or more groups of participants. For example, a firm that sells auction services is connecting sellers with buyers. This project will develop new economic theory and will test the theory using data from auction sales of used heavy-duty trucks in the United States. The data analysis will examine the effects of a specific previous merger in this industry to see if and how the merger reduced competition. The methods developed in this project can also be used to examine other markets with competition between between multisided platform firms. Policymakers in the US are asked to evaluate proposed mergers to determine whether the merger might reduce competition. This is a difficult task for these types of merger, since the evaluation has to take into account both how the platforms interact and how the merger might change interactions. This project will develop and demonstrate one way to evaluate these factors. Preserving and strengthening competition strengthens the U.S. economy as a whole.<br/><br/>The project will extend the existing theoretical models of multisided platforms by including both horizontal differentiation between platforms and vertical differentiation among goods. According to the model constructed in the project, the higher fees charged by the platforms along with the merger have a heterogeneous impact on sellers with goods at different quality levels. When there are different indirect network effects among the groups on these platforms, it can trigger a change of quality structure across platforms. This structural change is more significant if there is less horizontal differentiation between platforms, which can make the number of participants more elastic to the fees and the indirect network effect. These findings are consistent with transaction data collected from the U.S. used heavy-duty truck auction market. According to the data, the high-quality trucks sold on the offline platform are valued more than the ones sold on the online platform. After the merger of the leading offline and online auction platforms, the offline platform charges a higher fee and uses a cross-platform information policy to reduce the search friction across the two platforms. These policy changes affect the decisions of buyers and sellers, resulting in a quality structure change on these two platforms: low-quality trucks are more likely to be transacted on the online platform, and high-quality trucks tend to be transacted on the offline platform. The difference in transaction prices on these platforms becomes more significant than before. The project will focus on this possible market evolution caused by the merger. After performing a structural estimation based on the model, the project will investigate the welfare implication of the merger on different groups and show several ways to improve the platform's revenue or social welfare. The method and results used in this project are especially useful when the markets have vertically differentiated goods, such as the health insurance market and the peer-to-peer lending market. The project can help us to understand the potential heterogeneous impact of mergers on different groups in those markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Do non-human animals have a rich representation of the flow of past events? Can they replay episodic memories after incidental encoding in an unexpected assessment of memory? Can they replay episodic memories forward and backward in time? Can they ""remember to remember"" episodic memories? Evidence of this type is critical to develop an animal model that recapitulates critical aspects of human episodic memory mechanisms to effectively use the causal techniques developed in animals to begin to provide insights about specific cognitive mechanisms that occur in people.

Workshop participants will focus on four key areas: Science communication (including public-facing events, writing, and social media), science education (including engaging with students and with educators about science), informal science education and outreach (such as through museums and libraries), and scientific work with communities (such as citizen science and community-based research). Workshop participants will identify and promote more meaningful broader impacts for philosophical research that includes public outreach and science education. The workshop will also serve to meet institutional goals for the University of Cincinnati's newly founded Center for Public Engagement with Science to strengthen connections with its community partners. The primary concrete deliverables from this workshop are four white papers, one on each of the indicated areas of public engagement; they will be submitted for presentation at pertinent conferences and professional society meetings. <br/><br/>The workshop will serve to enhance the capacity for socially engaged philosophy of science. That capacity includes conducting philosophical research with broader social relevance, developing the practical implications of philosophical research (such as advancing public policy), and involving philosophy of science in public engagement with broader science endeavors including science education, science communication, and citizen science. The workshop will work towards the overarching goal by fortifying existing bridges with other disciplines relevant to public engagement with science including science communication, science education, and science and technology studies. The first two days of the workshop will consist in morning and early-afternoon lectures from experts on each of the four key areas indicated above, followed by interactive breakout sessions in the late afternoon on each topic. The third day will focus on developing philosophy of science's potential to contribute to these areas of public engagement with science. Some of the core questions to be addressed are the following. What do philosophers of science have to contribute to this area of public engagement? What are some ways in which that contribution be realized? What resources or discussions in other disciplines already exist? What research do philosophers need to do public engagement? What are potential challenges? The end goal of this workshop is the development of new research networks between philosophers of science and other communities that focus on public engagement with science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will create algorithms and systematic methods to compute a collection of candidate trajectories or paths that will transfer an autonomous system to a corresponding collection of destinations instead of computing a single trajectory or path to a single destination. Having multiple alternative paths and corresponding destinations provides significant flexibility to the user. The latter point is consistent with every-day experience regarding the use of car navigation systems which often provide alternative routes with different times and traffic conditions in lieu of a single route. This paradigm shift in trajectory generation problems is motivated by the fact that in practice, it is hard for the user to accurately predict the future conditions at which a system will be operating (e.g., weather and traffic conditions) and thus committing to a single trajectory may not be ideal. One of the main bottlenecks in this class of problems is dealing with uncertainty in real-time (for instance, change in weather conditions may render certain candidate trajectories less suitable than others). The research team will create tractable model-based and data-driven algorithms which can be executed in real-time without compromising their ability to handle uncertainty. Finally, participation of undergraduate and underrepresented students will be encouraged through an array of research and teaching activities. The research will also have ramifications to other classes of control problems, including computational neuroscience and medicine and stochastic thermodynamical systems.<br/><br/>This research effort will create scalable and real-time implementable trajectory generation algorithms for uncertain dynamical systems based on both model-based and data-driven stochastic optimal control methods. In this research, the boundary conditions correspond to probability distributions rather than fixed states. This class of stochastic trajectory generation problems admits in the most general case an infinite dimensional representation, which is computationally intractable. This research relies instead on finite dimensional representations in which the uncertainty is either represented explicitly using the framework of stochastic differential equations or indirectly by using generalized polynomial chaos theory. Variational integrators for both representations will be developed to achieve real time optimization and provide robustness to discretization errors. This research will also create data-driven (i.e., model-free) trajectory optimization algorithms, in which the time-evolution of the first two moments of the uncertain state of the system is described in terms of machine learning methods (i.e., Gaussian processes) which leverage data collected along the system?s ensuing trajectory. The theory and algorithms of this research will be validated by means of extensive simulations and experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have sharp edges and flat faces. They are polyhedra. However, molecular crystals that twist as they grow are remarkably common, albeit little known. More than one third of simple molecular crystals are capable of forming twisted morphologies. As a largely unexplored phenomenon, crystal twisting introduces a new dimension to materials design. Plastic electronic devices, e.g. foldable LCD screens, smart phones, computers, and solar panels, depend on the shapes of tiny crystals that carry electricity. This collaborative project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, uncovers at a fundamental science level the effect of twisted morphologies on the propagation of electrical current and light through crystals comprising organic semiconductors in order to usher in the next age of personal consumer electronic devices as well as critical technologies associated with renewable energy. Early results show that twisting  boosts conductivity. Outreach activities embracing literature, art, history, and education reflect the themes of crystals and chirality (items that can be distinguished from their mirror image are chiral, for example a hand) that undergird these scientific efforts, with a focus on using intriguing aspects of twisted crystals as a platform to engage K-12 students in STEM-related activities in the NY metro area. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Helicoidal crystals with pitches from 1-500 microns can carry charge when grown from molecules that form traditional organic semiconductors. At the level of devices, twisting on these length scales can have critical consequences on light propagation and charge injection, extraction and hopping. To elucidate the general effect of twisting on such processes, a series of semiconducting compounds are induced to twist as they crystallize from the melt into thin films as part of this collaborative research, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF. Conductive and photoconductive atomic force microscopy and charge mobility measurements using a field-effect transistor platform are performed on these helicoidal crystals as a function of pitch to determine the modulation of electric field- and photo-induced charge transport locally along and perpendicular to the twisting axes. As optoelectronic devices typically require specific crystal orientations within active layers for optimal performance, electrocrystallization is applied to molten organic conductors to collimate twisted crystals on electrode surfaces. Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy measurements, in conjunction with complete imaging polarimetry unique to the PIs' laboratories, are actualized in the search for chiral defects introduced via twisting. In doing so, this research uncovers fundamental mechanisms of crystal growth while addressing inherent limitations in the field of organic electronics, including large charge transport anisotropies along less accessible crystallographic directions and difficulties in tuning molecular interactions independent of molecular structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Critical among such effects are the ways in which algorithms mediate various social practices and processes, and shape the ways we understand ourselves and our lived realities; the researcher refers to the capacity of algorithms to bring about such effects as algorithmic power. More specifically, the research project will explore critical algorithmic literacy, defined as the social practices and processes of ""reading"" and ""writing"" what algorithms say and mean, and it will investigate the possibility of knowledge-building and meaning-making processes as a bottom-up tool of governance that can be used to confront algorithmic power. Better understanding algorithmic literacy, particularly as it intersects with algorithmic power, can assist us in optimally managing the societal impacts of algorithms. The project is fundamentally concerned with ensuring algorithms work fairly and justly for all. Specifically, the insights produced from this research can inform how policymakers approach governing algorithms, how activist and advocacy organizations engage and educate their (potential) supporters, how educational institutions help students learn about algorithms, and how technology developers design their systems.<br/><br/>This research project on algorithmic literacy has three key goals. First, it strives to broaden visions of knowledge-building and meaning-making processes around algorithms will open up new avenues of inquiry on algorithmic knowledge and literacy. By rejecting normative hierarchies of knowledge, algorithm designers and users can begin to consider a wider range of knowledge practices. Second, the project attempts to move beyond narratives of knowledge and literacy that imply certain ""ignorant"" individuals, whose knowledge must be corrected in order for them to succeed in the world. In doing so, the research challenges existing approaches to consider what it might mean to view algorithmic literacy as transformative of both the individual and the world. Finally, the project adopts a novel approach to algorithmic power, premised on individual and collective confrontations with it. This approach will improve our understanding of the experience of algorithmic power and of the factors that stifle or facilitate repertoires of action in response. The results of the project promise to advance the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Ethics and Values in Science and Technology, and Information and Communication Technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent and widespread declines in milkweed plant populations are causing alarm, in large part because milkweeds are a critical food source for vulnerable populations of the iconic monarch butterfly. Milkweed restoration efforts have been initiated; however, the influence of seed source on subsequent plant growth and survival is unknown. For example, if milkweeds are locally adapted to specific climates or soil types, then moving them from one region to another could be problematic. This project will engage educators and their students from across the range of common milkweed in investigations to document patterns of local adaptation and to identify the environmental factors influencing the evolution of the species. The data gathered through this project should improve recommendations for how to select seeds for milkweed restoration projects. At the same time, researchers will document the impact of participation in this project on student learning and motivation in science. The collaboration between researchers, educators, and students will allow scientists to sample more populations than they could otherwise study while engaging students in authentic research experiences.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers will use a variety of methods to investigate biotic and abiotic factors that affect the patterns of local adaptation in common milkweed.  First, they will support educators and students at about 30 different institutions to study patterns of adaptation in experimental gardens planted at each site, and they will work to expand this network to engage more educators and students in relevant observational data collection. Educators will meet to improve and share lesson plans and to integrate new protocols into the curriculum.  Second, they will plant three large experimental gardens at sites in Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia to identify which milkweed traits most affect fitness in each environment at different life stages. At these three sites, they will not only study soil and climate related factors, but they will also observe pollinators and manipulate access to plants by herbivores to better understand the relative importance of these different factors on the evolution of milkweed traits across populations.  Third, they will gather genetic data for plants from each population to compare the patterns of natural selection on traits to the patterns of genetic diversity. In addition to integrating these approaches for studying local adaptation, researchers will assess the impact of engaging educators and students in the research process, including evaluating student learning of important scientific skills and concepts and measuring student motivation to study science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SEDI meetings are particularly conducive for beginning investigators as the meetings are small but cross-disciplinary, and they provide ample time for discussion of the pressing scientific questions. The objective of this proposal is to support the next generation of deep Earth scientists. Applications will be broadly solicited through the SEDI listserve, and applicants will be supported based on their abstracts and a statement of their situation. This workshop will contribute to the interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI and its meetings is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth.<br/><br/>SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth?s Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth?s deep interior, and of the effect that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The ?deep interior? includes the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth?s deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2021 and 2022 it will alternate between different colleges and universities in the Carolinas and Georgia; the location is determined at the previous conference. The topics of the conference are in the modern theory of dynamical systems. This is an area of mathematics that has had applications in computer science, cryptography, data analysis, physics, and biology and uses a variety of different branches of mathematics including analysis, topology, combinatorics, graph theory, and rigorous computation. This conference is important because it is the basis of much of the dynamical systems community in the Southeast. Many attendees come each year to continue ongoing collaborations, begin new projects, and hear from experts in the field. In addition to the traditional lively interaction among mathematicians from the Southeast there have been hour talks by invited leaders in the field from outside the region. The Carolina Dynamics Symposia feature one participant who will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins, as well as about three hour-long plenary participants giving lectures during the conference weekend. All meetings will also have twenty-minute to thirty-minute contributed talks, and invited talks. A significant number of talks are given by (graduate) students and young researchers. The conferences have led to successful research projects and publications in the past.

The unique aspect of this new approach is that rather than measuring scattering at different angles at the tissue surface, instead a single, multimode fiber will be used to collect all of the angular scattering and then computational methods will be used to reconstruct the angular distribution.  The approach will permit simplified measurements and analysis by using knowledgeof the distribution of scattering from cell nuclei, specifically that it forms ringed patterns.  A key proposed advance of this work will be to enable use of the fiber even when it is moved, for example during an endoscopy procedure, by leveraging the simplified measurements and introducing a real time calibration method.

Despite the potential importance of this soil feedback, there is incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that affect the temperature response of organic matter decomposition. This project is quantifying the soil and ecosystem-level responses to nearly three decades of experimental soil warming and documenting the magnitude of soil carbon feedback to global environmental processes. Extensive training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be another feature of this project.  Data analysis from the study will also be incorporated into courses taught by the project leaders, and will be used to refine terrestrial ecosystem model projections.<br/><br/>This project is investigating the mechanisms underlying feedback from forest ecosystems to the climate system resulting from more than two decades of in situ soil warming. Specifically, we are quantifying the biogeochemical and microbial responses to chronic soil warming, with an emphasis on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. This research is testing the hypothesis that long-term warming causes cycles of SOM decay punctuated by periods of structural and functional changes in the soil microbial community. Three ongoing warming experiments at the Harvard Forest Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site have experienced 5 degrees C above ambient soil temperatures for 13, 16 and 28 years. Together, these sites represent a dynamic time-series based on a common perturbation in a single ecosystem type. Research activities to complete the decadal plan of this LTREB project are organized around four targeted research questions which are being addressed through (1) continuation of core data measurements; (2) temperature manipulations both in situ and under laboratory conditions to examine the underlying mechanistic basis for the observed pattern of temporal non-linearity in the soil respiration response to long-term warming; (3) measurements of SOM chemistry and microbial community dynamics to determine if long-term warming enables and accelerates decay of recalcitrant soil carbon due to a fundamental shift in the structure and/or function of the microbial community; (4) measurements of N mineralization and above-ground carbon storage to determine if long-term warming will continue to accelerate the N cycle and stimulate carbon storage in trees; and (5) data integration activities, including cross-site data syntheses and microbial trait-based and ecosystem modeling efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students with strong teacher relationships perform better academically. However, minority students experience more negative and less caring relationships with teachers than majority peers. This project addresses the social processes producing these racial disparities in teacher-student relationships. A growing body of research suggests the race and class composition of schools plays a role: schools with more majority and higher SES students have stronger teacher-student relationships overall but also wider achievement gaps between majority and minority students while schools with more minority and lower SES students have weaker relationships overall but also less disparity. Current approaches cannot explain 1) how predominantly minority and majority schools differ in developing teacher-student relationships overall and 2) how majority and minority students? relationships with teachers vary within these differing environments. This project addresses these crucial factors through a comparative ethnography of a predominantly majority high school and a predominantly minority high school. This study will expand knowledge of inequality by showing how relationships are formed, maintained, and given meaning in school environments with varying outcomes for majority and minority students. The project will inform the design and implementation of educational reforms through identifying specific school-and classroom-level mechanisms that either support or constrain the development of teacher-student relationships. While focusing on relational cultures and inequality in schools, this project also has implications for youth-adult relationships in other organizational settings, such as in the criminal justice system and the workplace, thus implicating policies in these settings, as well. <br/><br/><br/>This project argues that schools have a relational culture, encompassing shared expectations and practices shaping interactions between teachers and students. The project analyzes how seemingly equivalent relationships between teachers and students can take varying forms in different schools with important implications for student outcomes. Through comparing across schools, this project analyzes: 1) how relational cultures are racialized and differentiated by social class, 2) how relational cultures produce differences in majority and minority students? relationships with teachers, and 3) how students' relationships with teachers impact their school experience and outcomes. To address these questions, this project utilizes eight months of daily observations and in-depth interviews with teachers (N=40), students (N=96), and administrators (N=20) at one majority white high school and one majority-minority high school. Data are analyzed using Atlas.TI to derive coding and themes capturing the similarities and differences across and within the cases.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding relational cultures, inequality regimes, and organizational processes, particularly for organizations varying in majority-minority concentration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will create algorithms and systematic methods to compute a collection of candidate trajectories or paths that will transfer an autonomous system to a corresponding collection of destinations instead of computing a single trajectory or path to a single destination. Having multiple alternative paths and corresponding destinations provides significant flexibility to the user. The latter point is consistent with every-day experience regarding the use of car navigation systems which often provide alternative routes with different times and traffic conditions in lieu of a single route. This paradigm shift in trajectory generation problems is motivated by the fact that in practice, it is hard for the user to accurately predict the future conditions at which a system will be operating (e.g., weather and traffic conditions) and thus committing to a single trajectory may not be ideal. One of the main bottlenecks in this class of problems is dealing with uncertainty in real-time (for instance, change in weather conditions may render certain candidate trajectories less suitable than others). The research team will create tractable model-based and data-driven algorithms which can be executed in real-time without compromising their ability to handle uncertainty. Finally, participation of undergraduate and underrepresented students will be encouraged through an array of research and teaching activities. The research will also have ramifications to other classes of control problems, including computational neuroscience and medicine and stochastic thermodynamical systems.<br/><br/>This research effort will create scalable and real-time implementable trajectory generation algorithms for uncertain dynamical systems based on both model-based and data-driven stochastic optimal control methods. In this research, the boundary conditions correspond to probability distributions rather than fixed states. This class of stochastic trajectory generation problems admits in the most general case an infinite dimensional representation, which is computationally intractable. This research relies instead on finite dimensional representations in which the uncertainty is either represented explicitly using the framework of stochastic differential equations or indirectly by using generalized polynomial chaos theory. Variational integrators for both representations will be developed to achieve real time optimization and provide robustness to discretization errors. This research will also create data-driven (i.e., model-free) trajectory optimization algorithms, in which the time-evolution of the first two moments of the uncertain state of the system is described in terms of machine learning methods (i.e., Gaussian processes) which leverage data collected along the system?s ensuing trajectory.

Rational-choice theory, despite successes in accounting for some aspects of human decision making under uncertainty, fails to capture certain recurrent patterns observed in behavior, such as biases and apparent randomness in choices. Some of these deviations from optimal behavior suggest that information is processed in the brain in a way that introduces imprecision, similar to the imprecision in sensory perception. A growing literature on perceptual judgments argues that in sensory contexts, these imprecisions often actually represent efficient adaptations, given constraints on the available cognitive resources. This raises a question as to whether patterns of imprecision in the case of higher-level cognitive processing (comparisons of numerical magnitudes, estimates of the average values of fluctuating series, and inference about unknown variables) cannot be understood in a similar way. We investigate this hypothesis through an array of experiments in which human subjects are asked to make decisions on the basis of multiple pieces of information, presented sequentially. Decisions made on the basis of sequential evidence are not only important in actual economic life, but also have the advantage as an object of study that they allow us to investigate how each piece of information is separately taken into account in the decision. This reveals the relative allocation of cognitive resources to the processing of each piece of evidence, which in turn sheds light on the underlying constraints faced by the brain. Overall, the main goal of our research is to provide an account of human judgments and economic decisions that is founded on normative principles, and that can be generalized to many problems of human decision-making.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, we investigate, in the context of economic decisions, the neurocognitive hypothesis that the brain faces a problem of constrained optimization: that of allocating its limited information-processing resources to achieve the best possible decisions. From this general principle, we derive testable quantitative models of cognitive processing and decision making that make specific predictions regarding the bias and randomness in human choices. In particular, these suboptimal patterns are predicted to depend on prior beliefs about the probability distribution from which the presented evidence is drawn, and on the rewards associated with different responses in a given context. To test this hypothesis, we design six experiments, in which we manipulate both the prior and the reward structure, and we examine the degree to which our proposed models of constrained information processing capture the behavioral patterns found in experimental data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have sharp edges and flat faces. They are polyhedra. However, molecular crystals that twist as they grow are remarkably common, albeit little known. More than one third of simple molecular crystals are capable of forming twisted morphologies. As a largely unexplored phenomenon, crystal twisting introduces a new dimension to materials design. Plastic electronic devices, e.g. foldable LCD screens, smart phones, computers, and solar panels, depend on the shapes of tiny crystals that carry electricity. This collaborative project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, uncovers at a fundamental science level the effect of twisted morphologies on the propagation of electrical current and light through crystals comprising organic semiconductors in order to usher in the next age of personal consumer electronic devices as well as critical technologies associated with renewable energy. Early results show that twisting  boosts conductivity. Outreach activities embracing literature, art, history, and education reflect the themes of crystals and chirality (items that can be distinguished from their mirror image are chiral, for example a hand) that undergird these scientific efforts, with a focus on using intriguing aspects of twisted crystals as a platform to engage K-12 students in STEM-related activities in the NY metro area. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Helicoidal crystals with pitches from 1-500 microns can carry charge when grown from molecules that form traditional organic semiconductors. At the level of devices, twisting on these length scales can have critical consequences on light propagation and charge injection, extraction and hopping. To elucidate the general effect of twisting on such processes, a series of semiconducting compounds are induced to twist as they crystallize from the melt into thin films as part of this collaborative research, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF. Conductive and photoconductive atomic force microscopy and charge mobility measurements using a field-effect transistor platform are performed on these helicoidal crystals as a function of pitch to determine the modulation of electric field- and photo-induced charge transport locally along and perpendicular to the twisting axes. As optoelectronic devices typically require specific crystal orientations within active layers for optimal performance, electrocrystallization is applied to molten organic conductors to collimate twisted crystals on electrode surfaces. Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy measurements, in conjunction with complete imaging polarimetry unique to the PIs' laboratories, are actualized in the search for chiral defects introduced via twisting. In doing so, this research uncovers fundamental mechanisms of crystal growth while addressing inherent limitations in the field of organic electronics, including large charge transport anisotropies along less accessible crystallographic directions and difficulties in tuning molecular interactions independent of molecular structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The AWM Workshops at the JMM and SIAM annual meetings increase the visibility of women in mathematics by providing an opportunity for early-career women to present their work at a national conference.  In particular, this award focuses on supporting participation of graduate students in these events. Increasing the participation of women and other under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences is of critical importance to the health of our society and changing the institutional norms of what a research mathematician looks like. By promoting the research of early-career women mathematicians, and by creating a tightly-knit  intellectual community centered on shared research interests, these events will generate new mentoring relationships, new research collaborations, and increased scientific output in featured research areas.  <br/><br/>Each meeting's Workshop has a research focus reflecting a previously held AWM Research Collaboration Workshop, a week-long event where participants work together on open research problems.  At a particular meeting's Workshop, leaders in each research field present their research with the intention of  introducing early-career mathematicians (primarily graduate students) to the current state-of-the-art in their field.   Graduate students, in turn, share their research during poster sessions and small group interactions.  The research topics of the next two workshops include Mathematics of Materials (SIAM 2020) and Analysis (JMM 2021). These topics span a broad spectrum of current mathematical problems, and will correspondingly enhance the future careers of a broad swath of early-career women mathematicians. The Intellectual Merit of the proposed workshops are inherited from each AWM Workshop: a tailored research event that brings together mathematicians working in a current, active, and relevant areas of research. Junior researchers in these areas will particularly benefit from collaborative events where they are exposed to the most recent advances in the area, helping accelerate the pace of breakthrough in that field.

Most of the known regulatory mechanisms occur at the outset of gene expression, when the synthesis of the protein is just being initiated. Thanks to the researchers' studies on how uniquely a small protein protects honeybees from bacterial infections, they realized that gene expression can also be modulated at the end of the road, when the synthesis of the encoded protein has already been completed. In this project, the researchers will investigate how widespread is this formerly unknown mechanism of gene expression regulation and will further explore the elements in the cell that guard it from working properly. The research activities will contribute to training students from high school, college, and graduate programs, as well as postdoctoral researchers. The results will be incorporated in the teaching and community service activities that the researchers conduct. The findings of the project will be communicated to the scientific community through presentations in national and international meetings and by publications in peer-reviewed journals. <br/><br/>It has formerly been assumed that once a protein is fully synthesized, it freely diffuses from the ribosome that has produced it. However, evidence has been gathered that this is not always the case: certain proteins, whose synthesis has been thoroughly completed, linger in and interact with the ribosome, and influence the behavior of ribosomes at the translation termination stage. The behavior of proteins during their release from the ribosome may impact the expression of genes encoding other proteins. During this project, ribosome profiling (Ribo- Seq), an approach that reveals the position of translating ribosomes genome wide, will help identify the Escherichia coli genes where the end of protein synthesis is sluggish. Biochemical approaches in combination with structural studies will help elucidate the lingering interactions of the completed protein with the ?mother? ribosome that modulate the termination phase of gene expression. The proposed research will advance our understanding of a previously unknown layer of translation regulation controlled by interactions between the nascent protein and the ribosome. The findings of the project may spark new ideas to control gene expression in response to variable biotic and abiotic conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information can shed light on the processes that both drive and respond to changes in Earth?s climate. Cold-water corals are found across the global ocean and can be dated with decadal precision, offering spatial and temporal records of the N cycle in the past. In addition, a single skeleton can be used to reconstruct both surface and deep ocean composition. Despite the promise of cold-water corals, we don?t fully understand how they record changes in the marine N cycle. We must strengthen this understanding before we use cold-water corals to produce reliable records of marine N cycling across space and time, across different coral species, and under different lifestyle and feeding patterns. This project examines how the isotopic composition of organic N trapped in coral skeletons is linked to marine N cycle properties. The study includes a series of lab experiments, measurements of live corals sampled from the natural environment, and measurements of coral skeletal material from different ocean regions and depth horizons archived in museums. The project involves undergraduates at St. Olaf College, Pomona College and Mt. San Antonio College, one of the largest community colleges in Southern California. These students will conduct the research with scientists and peers in collaborating labs. Participation in the project will build student research skills and scientific knowledge for advanced study and prepare students for the scientific workforce. The project will also develop educational materials, including YouTube videos, to promote interest in marine science and awareness of how climate change influences global oceans. These educational materials will be created in collaboration with high school students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The main tool used to investigate marine N cycle history is the isotope composition of particulate organic nitrogen (?15N-PON) exported from the euphotic zone, which can be accessed using sedimentary archives such as foraminiferal tests, anoxic sediments and soft corals. Recently, the ?15N of organic N trapped within asymbiotic scleractinian cold-water coral (CWC) skeletons has been shown to record the ?15N-PON exported from the surface ocean (Wang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2017). In order to reliably apply CWC ?15N as a proxy, however, we must explain a ~8.5? offset between the ?15N of organic nitrogen within the CWC skeleton and the exported ?15N-PON in regions of coral growth (Wang et al. 2014). The nature of the ?15N offset must be accounted for to be confident that CWC records marine N cycle history consistently across space and time, across different coral species, and for corals with different lifestyle conditions. Through coral culture experiments, measurements of live corals samples from the natural environment, and archives of corals skeletal material from different ocean regions and depth horizons, this research will test whether the offset arises from: (1) a biosynthetic isotope offset between CWC tissue and skeleton, (2) an unusual trophic transfer between CWC tissue and diet, and/or (3) coral feeding on material with elevated ?15N relative to exported ?15N-PON. This work will also provide estimates of N turnover time in CWC, which are scant, and will inform trophic ecology of CWC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project helps develop archaeologically visible indicators of when a food type recovered in relatively low abundance might relate to human nutritional demands. In the American Southwest, it has long been assumed that fish were unimportant in the diet of Ancestral Pueblo groups. Yet, small numbers of fish remains are consistently recovered from late prehispanic archaeological sites in New Mexico, and they are rare during earlier time periods. The end of drought conditions may have impacted how people made different decisions about the foods they ate. In addition, prehispanic fishing in desert ecosystems is of interest to both archaeologists and ecologists. Understanding more about the ecology of prehispanic fish communities will provide a new source of paleoenvironmental information in a region where fish remains are thought to be insignificant. Desert streams are of critical conservation concern given modern anthropogenic impacts and current drought forecasts. The results of this project will be of interest not only to scholars, but to agencies charged with the management of plants and animals in desert ecosystems. This research will also support the work of a young scholar earning his PhD and will provide hands-on training and funding for one undergraduate research assistant.<br/><br/>Dombrosky, under the supervision of Dr. Jones, will use theory rooted in behavioral ecology to understand how fishing might have become an optimal food-getting strategy for Ancestral Pueblo farmers. Three lines of evidence will test this question: 1) radiocarbon dates of fish bones, to establish the timing and tempo of fishing; 2) body size estimations of fishes from archaeological sites, to assess whether they were unusually large; and 3) analysis of the stable isotopic composition of fish bones recovered from these sites, to determine if fishes had more variable diets during the late prehispanic period.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increases in extremes are to be expected given that warmer air typically contains more moisture.  But the moisture-temperature relationship does not by itself provide a theory to predict increases in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation in a warming climate.  Moreover, a satisfactory theoretical framework would address changes in the frequency of occurrence of precipitation events of all magnitudes, from weak to moderate to unprecedented.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to develop such a theoretical framework by treating convective precipitation as a random process and applying the tools of statistical mechanics (the emphasis on convective precipitation is reasonable given that convective clouds are the source of most intense precipitation).  The goal is to understand how the probability of occurrence of convective precipitation events of a given magnitude or intensity, referred to as the probability distribution, depends on temperature, moisture, and other environmental factors.  Earlier work by the PI and others shows initiation and rapid intensification in convective precipitation as atmospheric moisture increases beyond a temperature-dependent threshold, a sort of threshold value of bulk column relative humidity. <br/><br/>Research supported here extends earlier results by incorporating considerations of thermodynamic energy, atmospheric stability, and the probability distribution of the column moisture responsible for threshold behavior in precipitation.  One novelty of the work is the use of collocated data from the Global Precipitation Mission and Radio Occultation receivers on the COSMIC and COSMIC-2 satellites to explore the high moisture/heavy precipitation regime.  Additional work uses these ideas to develop representations of convective precipitation for use in models of the interaction of precipitation and atmospheric circulation. Results of the research are used to evaluate simulations from state-of-the-art climate models, attempting to connect extreme precipitation behaviors in present-day simulations to future increases.  If robust connections can be found the present-day simulations can be evaluated against relevant observations, and the success of models in reproducing observed connections can be used as a benchmark to assess the validity of their simulations of the response to anthropogenic forcing.<br/><br/>The project has societal relevance due to the connection between warming temperatures and increases in extreme event frequency and severity. Concerns over increasing damage from extreme precipitation have prompted considerable effort in generating and analyzing future climate simulations from global climate models and higher resolution regional models.  But results of this ""brute force"" approach come with substantial uncertainty regarding the degree, geographical distribution, and other characteristics of the increases.  A solid theoretical framework would thus be quite valuable in guiding the effort and interpreting its results.  This project makes a direct connection between the development of new theory and its application to the analysis of climate model behaviors, thereby establishing an immediate connection to the larger enterprise of climate change impacts assessment.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, and results of the work are used to develop classroom teaching materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Forearc basins develop oceanward of the magmatic arc of a convergent margin and trap sediment in deep troughs. These basins can exist for tens to hundreds of millions of years, serving as a long-term record of past Earth environments, processes, climate regimes, and life. They also host natural resources such as oil and gas. The goal of this research is to determine the origin of forearc basins by investigating the relationship between the types of rocks that underlie the basin and the sedimentary rocks preserved within the basin. The research and education components of this project focus on increasing diversity in, and accessibility to, the geosciences through sustained engagement with underrepresented undergraduate students and middle school girls from rural communities in Montana. Students will participate in research design, field and laboratory work, and national conferences. Students also will help lead a STEM workshop for middle school girls focused on rocks and minerals from the western U.S. and Tibet. The project will resolve critical questions in the evolution of Earth and offer opportunities to students who traditionally have limited participation in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The mechanisms of forearc basin formation are not well understood because of poor preservation in the rock record or overprinting of primary tectonic and stratigraphic relationships by subsequent deformation. This research will test the hypothesis that extension of the underlying basement in a forearc region provides a mechanism to trap sediment and initiate basin subsidence as a precursor to forearc basin formation. The hypothesis will be tested by applying chronologic and geochemical methods to describe the tectonic setting of basement formation, timing and rates of basement-forearc development, and subsequent geologic history. The research will combine field mapping and sedimentology with sandstone petrography, biostratigraphy, geochronology, paleomagnetism, and low-temperature thermochronology. Field areas include the Great Valley forearc, California and the Xigaze forearc, Tibet. Each field area preserves primary relationships between basement and basin stratigraphy in similar, but not identical tectonic settings.

The centromere is an essential chromosomal structure with multiple functional roles necessary for faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells. This project will provide new insights into molecular mechanisms that lead to formation and maintenance of centromeres. In addition, the project will provide research and training opportunities to postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the San Antonio area, many of whom are under-represented minorities and underprivileged.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to determine the factors and steps responsible for centromere formation and maintenance. Ubiquitylation of CENP-A protein is essential for CENP-A centromere deposition and assembly; hence, the hypothesis is that identification of ubiquitin-dependent CENP-A interactors will provide crucial information about mechanisms that control centromere assembly and maintenance. The following specific aims test this hypothesis: (1) determine the role of RAD50 (and the MRN complex) in CENP-A deposition at the centromere and its stability in centromeric nucleosomes (preliminary data implicate these proteins in ubiquitylation-dependent interactions with CENP-A); and (2) determine the role of R-loops in CENP-A deposition at the centromere (preliminary data implicate RNA helicase A, which is involved in R-loop formation and resolution, in ubiquitylation-dependent interactions with CENP-A).

This is one of the longest-running GRCs; the first took place in 1955. The 2020 meeting provides a forum to address the latest advances and discoveries in high pressure research, with emphasis on the ways in which the combination of theory, advanced computational methods and experiment are shaping the future of high pressure research. The conference attracts many young researchers as well as pioneers of the field. This meeting has a distinct place among high pressure conferences for its unique format that maximizes scientific discussions. One of the major goals is creating a highly interactive environment where new ideas are presented and are brainstormed by exceptionally talented young researchers and internationally recognized leaders in the field. The collegial atmosphere motivates new directions and promotes mentoring. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The 2020 meeting covers the most recent discoveries in high pressure research such as novel binary compounds under pressure (super-hydrides, He compounds, N-rich compounds, and ices in planetary interiors). These discoveries have led to remarkable achievements such as record superconducting temperatures and capacities for storage of chemical energy. An upcoming challenge of the field is to explore the stability of ternary and quaternary compounds, requiring novel experimental and computational strategies. For this reason, a novelty of the 2020 program is a prospective session focusing on first steps to tackle complexity at extreme thermodynamic conditions, and on how big-data and machine-learning based approaches may be adapted to the research strategy, both in treating the big data output of large facilities and by optimizing the exploration of the phase space of multicomponent materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project will use laboratory experiments to test whether increasing the size of reward or punishment (stakes henceforth) while considering how others will react affect the effort one puts into studying the environment before s/he makes the decision.  The research will answer the following questions: (i) does the size of stakes affect people?s choices and beliefs? (ii) does higher stakes lead to better responses? (iii) do beliefs become more accurate as stakes increase?, and (iv) do these effects depend on how complex the problem is?  In spite of the importance of these questions to economic science, economists have not been able to test them because there is a feedback effect among stakes, beliefs, and actions---changing stakes for one person will change their beliefs and actions, accordingly, thus making it impossible to determine how the size of reward or punishment affects effort.  The laboratory experiments, which allows the researcher to get around these problems, are designed to allow the researcher to change the size of the reward while allowing people to play the role of decision maker as well as observers.  This allows the researcher to study how people form beliefs about others as well as react to changes in stakes at the same time.  The results of this research will help improve decision making, especially when interacting with other people, and in the process, increase productivity and economic growth.     <br/><br/>An individual facing a decision takes into account possible courses of action as well as what is at stake. In addition, if the outcome of such a decision depends on what others do, a decision maker may spend some time to understand how her own action and those of others interact.  This research analyzes the following questions: Do stakes affect choices and belief formation? Do higher stakes lead to higher best-response rates? Do beliefs become more accurate as stakes increase? Do these effects depend on how complex the game is?  Current literature does not provide answers to these questions and this research aims to fill this gap.   This project test how changing the stakes in a strategic environment affect both the choices of the individual and the beliefs formed on others? likely strategy. A fundamental challenge of testing these hypotheses is that there exists interaction effects among incentives, beliefs, and actions: changing the incentives of one subject will not only affect that particular individual but also on others who will change their behavior.  The research project overcomes this issue through an experimental design where subjects act  as  both players and observers. In the latter, their own payoff changes but they make choices in an environment where choices have already been made by other actors with  different incentives.   The research design is able to isolate the effect of scaling up the stakes on choices and beliefs from equilibrium. Furthermore, the design will allow the researchers to provide new insights on cross-game comparisons.  It also presents a new class of games spanning those requiring multiple steps of iterative deletion of dominated strategies to those without pure-strategy equilibria. This class of games has various desirable properties in terms of their connection to level-k and random utility models.  The results of this research will help improve decision making, especially when interacting with other people and in the process increase productivity and economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working with specialists in Human-Computer Interaction, the principal investigators ethnographically investigate how computer scientists seek to translate data visualizations into other sensory modes for visually impaired users. Through historical research, this project documents how the science and technology studies can inform the development of communication technologies for people with disabilities, which will also be the foundation for developing a set of best practices for integrating social analysis into the technical research process.<br/><br/>This project follows a tradition of technically-engaged Science and Technology Studies projects that takes scientific collaboration as a working method and a site of investigation. Using insights from critical disability studies, the history of computing, and sensory studies, the principle investigators explore how discourses of ?accessibility? as a design ideal in Human-Computer Interaction always involve implicit ideas about physical, perceptual, and cognitive ability. By using historical and ethnographic methods to make those ideas explicit, this project seeks to improve approaches to conceptualizing and designing communication technologies for people with disabilities. The historical case study of tactile reading systems like braille and haptic computer interfaces serves as an empirical basis for understanding how ideas about ability become embedded in the design of computer interfaces. This project thus draws on the long history of these systems to investigate, inform, and critique the current practice of making multisensory data visualizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information can shed light on the processes that both drive and respond to changes in Earth?s climate. Cold-water corals are found across the global ocean and can be dated with decadal precision, offering spatial and temporal records of the N cycle in the past. In addition, a single skeleton can be used to reconstruct both surface and deep ocean composition. Despite the promise of cold-water corals, we don?t fully understand how they record changes in the marine N cycle. We must strengthen this understanding before we use cold-water corals to produce reliable records of marine N cycling across space and time, across different coral species, and under different lifestyle and feeding patterns. This project examines how the isotopic composition of organic N trapped in coral skeletons is linked to marine N cycle properties. The study includes a series of lab experiments, measurements of live corals sampled from the natural environment, and measurements of coral skeletal material from different ocean regions and depth horizons archived in museums. The project involves undergraduates at St. Olaf College, Pomona College and Mt. San Antonio College, one of the largest community colleges in Southern California. These students will conduct the research with scientists and peers in collaborating labs. Participation in the project will build student research skills and scientific knowledge for advanced study and prepare students for the scientific workforce. The project will also develop educational materials, including YouTube videos, to promote interest in marine science and awareness of how climate change influences global oceans. These educational materials will be created in collaboration with high school students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The main tool used to investigate marine N cycle history is the isotope composition of particulate organic nitrogen (?15N-PON) exported from the euphotic zone, which can be accessed using sedimentary archives such as foraminiferal tests, anoxic sediments and soft corals. Recently, the ?15N of organic N trapped within asymbiotic scleractinian cold-water coral (CWC) skeletons has been shown to record the ?15N-PON exported from the surface ocean (Wang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2017). In order to reliably apply CWC ?15N as a proxy, however, we must explain a ~8.5? offset between the ?15N of organic nitrogen within the CWC skeleton and the exported ?15N-PON in regions of coral growth (Wang et al. 2014). The nature of the ?15N offset must be accounted for to be confident that CWC records marine N cycle history consistently across space and time, across different coral species, and for corals with different lifestyle conditions. Through coral culture experiments, measurements of live corals samples from the natural environment, and archives of corals skeletal material from different ocean regions and depth horizons, this research will test whether the offset arises from: (1) a biosynthetic isotope offset between CWC tissue and skeleton, (2) an unusual trophic transfer between CWC tissue and diet, and/or (3) coral feeding on material with elevated ?15N relative to exported ?15N-PON. This work will also provide estimates of N turnover time in CWC, which are scant, and will inform trophic ecology of CWC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These waves can be recorded at a safe distance from volcanoes and used to constrain eruptive processes that are otherwise obscured from study. This project will develop computer simulations of magma ascent through volcanic conduits in the solid Earth and eruption into the atmosphere that also capture sound and seismic waves. Most current eruption simulations are based on simplifying approximations, like incompressible fluids and rigid solids, that eliminate waves. Simulation results from the project can be used to improve volcano monitoring, data interpretation, and hazard assessment. The project will provide training for a PhD student and postdoctoral scholar, and outreach activities for the general public include volcano-related demos at local elementary school science nights, STEMTaught articles for an elementary-school-level textbook meeting the Next Generation Science Standards, and a Stanford Ask A Scientist webpage.<br/><br/>The eruption simulations will utilize a state-of-the-art aeroacoustics code originally designed to study sound radiation by turbulent jets and shocks created by discharge of high pressure gas from jet engines. The code will be modified to study volcanic eruptions by coupling to an unsteady conduit flow code that models the ascent, depressurization, and fragmentation of magma. Simulations of vulcanian and strombolian eruptions will be used to 1.) assess the validity of commonly used acoustic source models like the point monopole and linear acoustics; 2.) quantify the effects of turbulent entrainment on infrasound generation (facilitating joint interpretation of visual and infrasound data); and 3.) probe subsurface eruptive processes like the rate of depressurization of shallow reservoirs, providing insight into how gas and magma are temporarily stored, pressurized, and released near the vent; also, identify signatures of the descent of the fragmentation surface down the conduit in large vulcanian explosions. Seismic representation theory will be used to convert pressure and momentum changes within the conduit to equivalent seismic moment tensor and force sources in the elastic wave equation. Seismic constraints on eruptive processes like fragmentation will be derived to complement infrasound constraints.

In a remarkably short period of time, this energy-intensive machine has spread to many places where it previously did not exist. Adoption of this device, however, involves more than coping with heat. In places where it has become commonplace, it not only produces expectations of comfort, but shapes everyday routines. Furthermore, technologies are not simply adopted; they also are adapted and re-designed when manufactured in different places. This project investigates how air-conditioning affects and becomes integrated into new places and cultures and is also altered by them. This research thus contributes to efforts to regulate air-conditioning use by offering a better understanding of its social and cultural dimensions. In doing so, it contributes to understanding of how key technologies are made operational in new contexts, and of the practical and conceptual labor by which technologies are re-designed for new social and environmental contexts. Findings will be disseminated at academic conferences and in scholarly journals, and the project?s broader outcomes include delivering lectures and holding workshops with grassroots organizations interested in urban environmental issues, and graduate student mentorship and training. <br/><br/>Over the past few years, air-conditioning use and load have increased dramatically in arid environments.  These regions are not only consumers of air-conditioning, but also producers who manufacture machines for local and international markets. The local reliance on air-conditioning in these environments, coupled with their hot climate and active manufacturing of air conditioners, make them an ideal context to investigate the reciprocal processes by which technology transforms places and people, and is in turn transformed by them. This project will examine three processes through historical research and field methods: (1) The introduction of air-conditioning and its effect on architecture and daily routines, (2) The manufacture of air-conditioning and the management of the electric grid that sustains its operation, and (3) Everyday experiences of cooling and heat exposure among low, middle, and high-income families. This study will also contribute to academic and policy discussions on the growing consumption of air-conditioning by demonstrating how not only affordability and discomfort shape its use; it is also intertwined with the development of specific cultural values. This brings the project into dialogue with broader concerns related to energy sustainability and the future of thermal comfort in urban centers worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also develop educational materials, including YouTube videos, to promote interest in marine science and awareness of how climate change influences global oceans. These educational materials will be created in collaboration with high school students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The main tool used to investigate marine N cycle history is the isotope composition of particulate organic nitrogen (?15N-PON) exported from the euphotic zone, which can be accessed using sedimentary archives such as foraminiferal tests, anoxic sediments and soft corals. Recently, the ?15N of organic N trapped within asymbiotic scleractinian cold-water coral (CWC) skeletons has been shown to record the ?15N-PON exported from the surface ocean (Wang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2017). In order to reliably apply CWC ?15N as a proxy, however, we must explain a ~8.5? offset between the ?15N of organic nitrogen within the CWC skeleton and the exported ?15N-PON in regions of coral growth (Wang et al. 2014). The nature of the ?15N offset must be accounted for to be confident that CWC records marine N cycle history consistently across space and time, across different coral species, and for corals with different lifestyle conditions. Through coral culture experiments, measurements of live corals samples from the natural environment, and archives of corals skeletal material from different ocean regions and depth horizons, this research will test whether the offset arises from: (1) a biosynthetic isotope offset between CWC tissue and skeleton, (2) an unusual trophic transfer between CWC tissue and diet, and/or (3) coral feeding on material with elevated ?15N relative to exported ?15N-PON. This work will also provide estimates of N turnover time in CWC, which are scant, and will inform trophic ecology of CWC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells are highly selective in where they begin (initiate) transcription of their genes.  The mechanism of locating the starting positions of transcription is shared by most eukaryotic organisms such as humans, plants, and fungi. Yet, a distinct way of transcription initiation has been found in a few fungal species including Baker?s yeast. This project aims to determine when and how the mechanisms of transcription initiation have diverged. Success of this project will advance basic understandings of the evolution and genetic mechanisms of transcription initiation, a first step in harnessing the power of biology for the bioeconomy.  This project also develops new software and generates a large collection of mRNA sequences, which will benefit the research community. In addition, this project will build a user-friendly database that can serve as a portal for improving public literacy in genomics and facilitate teaching in K-12 schools and colleges. This project also contributes to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce by training a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.<br/><br/>In most eukaryotes, transcription is initiated by a large enzyme preinitiation complex at about 30 nucleotides downstream of a short sequence element known as the TATA box, where the preinitiation complex is assembled. In contrast, the preinitiation complex scans DNA sequences further downstream of the TATA box for favorable transcription start sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  This project aims to elucidate when the transcription initiation mechanisms have diverged and to identify key genetic changes associated with this process. This project applies a combination of computational and experimental approaches to determine the initiation mechanism of 68 fungal species. Aim 1 of this project will develop novel bioinformatics tools for accurate mapping of transcription start sites based on high throughput sequencing data. In Aim 2, this project will capture the first nucleotide of RNA molecules and sequence these transcripts to generate transcription start site maps for 68 species representing all major fungal lineages. The initiation mechanism for each species will be determined based on the distribution of the TATA box relative to the transcription start site on a genomic scale. A detailed evolutionary history of initiation mechanisms will be depicted to pinpoint the occurrence of divergence. The third project aim will identify the key genes associated with the divergence of transcription initiation mechanisms based on their evolutionary history and expression profiles. Important genetic changes in these genes are also expected to be determined through comparative sequence analyses. These results will lay a solid foundation for future interrogation of the specific functions of preinitiation complex components in transcription initiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The amount of oxygen consumed per mole of respired organic carbon, the respiration quotient, is key for accurately predicting ocean oxygen concentrations and how ocean oxygen levels will respond to climate change. Despite this importance, the respiration quotient has rarely been measured directly. The aim of this research is to estimate the respiration quotient and its variability across ocean regions and depth. This will be done through an integration of direct chemical measurements of particulate organic matter collected from multiple ocean regions and indirectly by using an ocean circulation model to analyze a global database of dissolved oxygen and carbon concentration with a circulation model. In addition to advancing the understanding of the ocean oxygen cycle in the scientific community, this project will provide research training for researchers and students. The project will also improve awareness and understanding in the general public about possible future changes to marine oxygen concentrations.<br/><br/>One of the main uncertainties in predicting current and future oxygen levels is the regulation of the biological respiration demand. The respiration quotient describes the amount of oxygen needed during the consumption of one mole of organic carbon and thus is a key link between the carbon and oxygen cycles. Here, we propose to measure the amount of oxygen consumed per mole of respired organic carbon, the respiration quotient, in particulate organic matter (POM) from the surface and thermocline using a newly developed chemical technique. Thus, we aim to obtain new direct chemical measurements of the respiration quotient across distinct oceanic regimes and depths. Subsequently, we propose to incorporate these observations into a seasonally-resolved inverse model using global hydrographic tracer concentration data. This combined approach will provide the first global-scale estimates (and uncertainties) of the mean and regional variability of the respiration quotient in the POM stock and export flux. Different parameterizations linking the respiration quotient to regions or environmental variables will be applied to test how they impact and replicate global oxygen concentrations and the extent of the oxygen minimum zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop a new approach to analyze how people make decisions between trying new experiences or continuing with long standing choices. The new approach applies to many real world situations that are not well explained with existing models. For instance, an investor might invest in one stock while gathering information on the returns to a different investment. A policymaker might explore new alternatives while implementing existing policy. An employee might search for a new job while continuing her current employment. The model applies to these situations where an individual chooses between multiple projects with unknown rewards and can invest in one to earn a reward while also observing the rewards of different projects. The new model is an alternative to a large class of models from economics and statistics that has studied a different kind of experimentation problem, often referred to as the bandit problem. In a bandit problem, the decision maker can only learn through investing. She gains information only about the project that she chooses: what she learns is linked to what she earns. The result is a well-known trade-off between exploration and exploitation: the decision - maker may desire investment in a low reward project because it offers valuable learning. The existing group of bandit models have been widely applied. The new research funded by this grant could result in deeper understanding of a similarly wide range of applications, including applications that could enhance national security and strengthen the US economy.<br/> <br/><br/>The research team will consider three environments that offer a particularly stark contrast with the classical experimentation framework. First, when experimentation is conducted by individuals, the optimal alternative is always eventually discovered. This contrasts with the classical result of incomplete learning in classical experimentation with discounting. However, behavior is more complex than in standard experimentation environments since a simple index (such as the Gittins index,which characterizes solutions in the classical framework) need not exist. Second, teams composed of similar members are no longer subject to free-rider problems: when observation and exploitation are separated, teams achieve efficient experimentation. The team will also analyze questions that cannot be addressed in the standard setting. Specifically, the project explores a delegation environment in which there are two agents: the executive (Doer), who chooses the project to be implemented, and the intelligence agency (Observer), who chooses what project to look at. Because the objectives of these two agents may be misaligned, delegated choices may yield either minimal or maximal experimentation depending on the nature of contact between the doer and the observer. Ultimately, the project has the potential to uncover novel features of experimentation that can be applied to various applications and tested against data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will investigate and identify the thermal transport mechanisms leading to the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, to allow design of effective thermal management for reliable performance. Moreover, this project will encompass educational tasks designed to bridge the gap between thermal sciences and electronic device physics and to lower the entry barrier for undergraduate students to study nanoscale heat transfer principles. The educational activities will also expose underrepresented students to industry-driven academic research and inspire K-12 students to pursue STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to experimentally identify and probe nanoscopic, non-Fourier thermal transport mechanisms that are responsible for the amplified heating within gallium nitride transistors simultaneously subjected to extreme electric field and heat flux conditions. It is hypothesized that the observed amplified heating is a combined result of nanoscale heat source size effects, electric field induced deformation of the gallium nitride crystal, and thermal non-equilibrium among energy carriers, all of which are caused by a nanoscale electric field spike. A deep ultraviolet thermal imaging capability which offers the highest spatial resolution among commercial thermal imaging systems will be developed in order to test this hypothesis and to study the fundamental physics in gallium nitride transistors. The developed deep ultraviolet thermal imaging technique will be used together with Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and a novel multi-scale electro-thermal modeling scheme to study the physical origins of the amplified heating in high voltage-biased gallium nitride transistors.

As discovered worldwide, fault damage zones around major faults accommodate a significant portion of plate motion through seismic and aseismic deformation. However, the poorly understood link between fault damage zones and earthquake source processes remains a fundamental issue that hinders the advancement of earthquake physics research and seismic hazard mitigation. Using a combination of new fault zone imaging methods and fully dynamic earthquake cycle models, the project aims to understand how fault damage zones impact the generation of earthquakes that occur within seconds and how the structure of fault damage zones involves over hundreds of years under the influence of earthquakes and interseismic slip. The project will also promote and enrich the learning experiences of a wide range of students and increase the diversity of students majoring in geophysics. The research lies on the interface of seismic data analysis, earthquake modeling, and fault zone geology, providing a unique opportunity to synergize various research facets and promote communication between different research communities.<br/><br/>The current understanding of earthquake source physics is limited by the lack of constraints on the spatial distribution of fault damage zones and their effects on seismicity and interseismic deformation. Previous fault zone studies have relied on near-fault seismic arrays to obtain a cross-sectional view at the array location. The project will image the along-strike variation of fault damage zones and characterize site effects using broadband seismic networks to investigate whether fault damage zones strongly affect seismicity patterns. The project will also improve the understanding of stress drop variation by considering the effects of fault zone waves on earthquake source spectra. Moreover, previous simulations of earthquakes in fault zones have modeled either single earthquakes using arbitrary stress conditions or earthquake cycles without dynamic waves. The project will model earthquakes and interseismic deformation by considering damage rheology and dynamic effects of the fault zone wavefield. The seismic observations and earthquake cycle simulations together will unveil how fault damage zones influence earthquake source processes and how earthquakes and interseismic deformation contribute to the formation of fault damage zones. Additionally, the project will involve graduate students to design and lead hands-on geophysical activities related to the research for Earth Camp, a UM outreach program that provides week-long experiences to educate underrepresented high school students.

Although they are gestural/visual rather than auditory, signed languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL), are full languages with equal expressive complexity. This has only been recently recognized, however, so ASL research is in its infancy. Comparing signed and spoken languages can reveal the basic cognitive principles that underlie human language. The present study focuses on iconicity, which means that a word or sign resembles its meaning. For example, the sounds in the English word 'pop' mimic a popping noise, and the arrangement of the arm and fingers in the ASL sign 'tree' resemble a tree trunk and branches. Most spoken words are not iconic, but iconic signs are the norm rather than the exception in ASL. This study asks whether iconicity impacts the grammatical patterns of ASL. Do iconic and non-iconic signs function differently? Answering this question will help us better understand how the physical form of a language (speech or sign) impacts its mental organization.<br/><br/>To answer this question, grammatical patterns that occur in natural, everyday signing are compared in how they apply to iconic and non-iconic signs. Deaf adult participants are video recorded responding to open-ended prompts about Deaf cultural events. They then watch video clips of ASL signs and sentences in which specific grammatical patterns apply to iconic and non-iconic signs. They respond to each clip, indicating whether the ASL they saw is grammatically correct. If participants apply grammatical patterns differently to iconic versus non-iconic signs, this is evidence that iconicity is part of the grammatical structure of ASL, not just of individual signs, suggesting a fundamental difference from the structure of spoken languages. But if grammatical patterns apply in the same way to iconic and non-iconic signs, this suggests that even though individual signs are more iconic than spoken language words, this property does not impact the language?s grammatical structure. These findings will deepen our understanding of human language beyond what we can learn through spoken language research alone. This knowledge can inform a wide range of applications, such as language acquisition for Deaf babies and training for ASL interpreters. The video narratives collected in the study will be made publicly available and can also serve research in language teaching, interpretation, and Deaf cultural studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although energy sector and agricultural sources are major contributors, natural microbiological sources account for roughly half of total global methane emissions.  Microbial methane production has long been assumed to be an anoxic process, carried out only under conditions of extremely low to zero oxygen. Recent research has demonstrated the potential for microbial methane production to occur in oxygenated upper waters of lakes and oceans through a previously unappreciated metabolic pathway present in microorganisms.  Under conditions of phosphorus deficiency, certain bacteria can utilize otherwise unreactive organic molecules known as methylphosphonates to meet their phosphorus requirements, releasing methane in the process.  The extent to which this mechanism supports the out-gassing of methane from lakes to the atmosphere is unknown, as are the consequences of changing environmental conditions upon it.  This project will address this knowledge gap by investigating the distributions, rates of and controls on aerobic methane production in Flathead Lake and 18 other Montana lakes of varying phosphorus deficiency status.  Because atmospheric deposition of pollutant nitrogen and deliberate measures to curtail phosphorus inputs to lakes can both lead to phosphorus deficiency, it is crucial that we know whether these factors may have the unexpected consequence of enhancing methane emissions.  This research will also directly support the education, field and laboratory experiences of graduate and undergraduate students and will provide training to local high school teachers from Native American (Kootenai and Salish) tribal lands.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate temporal and spatial variability in microbially-mediated, oxic methane production across lakes with varying phosphorus availability in western Montana. It is guided by the overarching hypothesis: diffusive effluxes of methane from oxic freshwater lakes are directly influenced by the nature and severity of ecosystem nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) deficiencies. A combination of observational and experimental approaches employing chemical, stable isotopic, metagenomic and PCR-based gene analyses will be used to examine: 1) time and space variability in the concentration, stable isotope composition, and net production of methane in freshwater lakes in Montana, focusing on Flathead Lake; 2) The extent to which microbial methylphosphonate degradation results in net production of methane in these lakes; 3) The functional diversity, abundances, and transcriptional activities of microorganisms involved in both phosphonate and methane cycling; and 4) How the stoichiometry (specifically nitrogen:phosphorus ratios) of aquatic nutrient (inorganic and total) pools influences oxic methane production and expression of methane cycling functional genes. The study will provide a systematic evaluation of microbial methane sources and the potential contribution of methylphosphonate degradation as a source of methane in oxic freshwater lakes. Results from this project will provide new insights and advance current understanding of coupled interactions between carbon and phosphorus cycling in freshwater lake habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data will be valuable in understanding slow slip and seismic fault motion in relation to each other, understanding event nucleation and fault slip. The slow slip earthquake persisted for a month causing the North Anatolian fault to slip significantly. The Mw 6.8 earthquake ruptured an 80km segment of the East Anatolian fault. The broader impacts of the work include collaboration with researchers at the Kandilli Observatory in Instanbul, improved understanding of earthquake hazards and rapid data availability to the US research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.<br/><br/>Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inequality is an intrinsic element of large-scale human societies but understanding how disparities in wealth and power differentially impacted the human condition in the past is not well studied. With its long-term perspective, archaeology is poised to make significant contributions to examining the impacts of permanent institutionalized inequality on the everyday lives of past people. This project will analyze disparities in household wealth, social well-being, and health within an ancient community to develop a more detailed understanding of how increasing political power impacted socioeconomic disparities over the span of about 2000 years. Understanding how ancient societies responded and adapted to political instability and socioeconomic differences in the past can provide important lessons as one confronts similar challenges today. This research is designed to improve quality of life concerns for local communities near the field site and project laboratory as well as provide educational opportunities for students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Studying the distribution of wealth and well-being in ancient societies requires a large dataset that is representative of the range of socioeconomic differences that were present in the past. Combining new archaeological investigations with analyses of legacy data that spans an approximately two thousand year period, this large-scale excavation project will sample between 40-50 households identified in recent settlement surveys. Multiple quality of life indices will be calculated using data from burials, domestic artifacts, and residential architecture to investigate the impacts of increasing political power on the distribution of household wealth and well-being disparities over this period. The data generated from this project will facilitate an innovative conceptual framework and methodology to analyze multiple kinds of household inequality, providing an important dataset for future comparative studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These factors include characteristics of the person (e.g., personality, attitudes) and characteristics of the situation (e.g., type of task, nature of the environment). Although these factors have helped to differentiate ?good? decision-makers from ?bad? decision-makers, they cannot explain why a given decision-maker makes good decisions at sometimes and bad decisions at other times. To do so, it is necessary to compare not just one person to another person, but also how and why one person differs from himself or herself from one point in time to the next. In other words, research needs to identify momentary factors (e.g., emotions) that explain why any one person is an effective decision-maker in one context but not in another context. This research aims to improve our ability to explain differences in decision-making effectiveness by examining the combination of momentary and stable factors within a nationally important context: policing. Momentary, or ?within-person? factors include emotions, physiological arousal, and sleep quality, and stable, or ?between-person? factors include personality traits and perceptions of the environment. Gaining a better understanding of when and why a given police officer makes good versus bad decisions not only promotes the progress of science, but it also advances the health, prosperity, and welfare of citizens, ultimately benefitting society.<br/><br/>This project will take a multilevel approach and examine police officer decision-making in the field at the episodic level. By viewing officer decision-making as a multilevel phenomenon, shaped by within- and between-person factors, our goal is to explain more variance in key decisions. The hypothesis is that between-person differences a) influence within-person states, which in turn affect decision-making processes and outcomes, and b) moderate the relationship between within-person states and decision-making processes and outcomes. To test this, we will utilize experience-sampling methodology with a sample of police officers in the field, surveying them twice daily for two-weeks, at two points in time, spaced nine months apart. We will assess police officers? emotions felt during positive and negative interactions with civilians and decisions made during those interactions. During the experience-sampling phase, we also will capture momentary assessments of physiological arousal and sleep quality via wearable sensors. In addition, we will measure stable factors by surveying officers about their personality traits (e.g., conscientiousness, self-monitoring) attitudes (e.g., trust in the public), and perceptions of their agency (e.g., fair culture). The identification of both within- and between-person factors should enhance police officer decision-making and lead to more consistent decisions by identifying event-level, momentary triggers that cause officers to stray from high levels of performance. Findings from this study will help agencies identify the types of encounters that increase officer anxiety or stress and leverage the advantages and disadvantages associated with emotions and, in so doing, may optimally position them to: (a) pinpoint ways to improve de-escalation strategies, (b) increase the self-awareness of officers when it comes to their emotional states, (c) reduce stress and promote officer well-being, and (d) develop training programs that might improve citizen and officer safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of these microbes are bacteria and reside in the gut. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota influences the brain and behavior of adults, and many of these effects are assumed to be due to altered neural development.  However, few studies have actually studied effects of microbes on the developing brain. Because the womb is sterile, mammals first encounter microbes at the moment of birth. The investigators on this project recently reported differences in the brain within the first hours after birth between mice that encountered a normal microbiota versus no microbiota at all. This project will determine whether the effects are due purely to postnatal exposure to microbes, or whether exposure of the mother during pregnancy also plays a role. Specific brain regions affected by the first exposure to microbes will be identified, and the investigators will examine the route by which microbes signal to the brain, as well as how various changes to the microbiota affect brain development. Humans routinely alter the microbiota of infants, either by hygiene practices or antibiotic treatment of the mother. Thus, in addition to addressing basic scientific questions about the relationship between our microbes and our developing brains, this work also has important implications for obstetric practices. <br/><br/>	Striking differences were recently found in developmental neuronal cell death, colonization of the brain by microglia, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines between mice born into a conventional environment versus those born into an environment devoid of microbes (germ-free, GF). Remarkably, these differences were already present 10-14 hours after birth, but were not seen prior to parturition. Effects were also brain region-specific, with the paraventricular and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus showing large effects. By cross-fostering mice that are gestated GF to conventionally colonized mothers within an hour of birth, this project will establish whether the effects are due purely to postnatal microbe exposure, or whether maternal factors also play a role. The impact of selective perturbations to the microbiota on the brain and gut microbiota will be examined by treating dams with non-absorbable antibiotics and, in a complementary approach, by examining the brains of newborn mice colonized with a defined, but markedly reduced microbiota. This project will also use chemical vagotomies of newborns to test the hypothesis that microbes signal the brain at birth via the vagus nerve. Throughout evolutionary history all mammals have been born into an environment replete with micro-organisms. Thus, our brains may be ?microbiota-dependent,? in a similar way that developing sensory systems are ?experience-dependent.? This is a fundamental concept that could change textbooks on neural development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The oldest preserved minerals found on Earth are zircons up to 4.4 billion years old, which is only a few tens of million years younger than the Earth itself. Some geochemists interpret these zircons as evidence that there was already, at that time, crust similar to continents, but it is very unclear how and whether plate tectonics could have started so early. In this work the investigators will explore an alternative series of processes that operated only in this early era of Earth history and determine whether these processes could have led to the formation of continental crust and could explain the zircon evidence. The process to be studied is rapid changes in the Earth?s rotation rate, or length of day. This is motivated by the most successful theories of the origin of the Moon, which all involve a giant impact, perhaps with a Mars-sized object, that left the Earth molten and rapidly spinning and ejected debris that condensed to form a very close-in Moon. It only takes about a million years for the outer shell of the Earth to freeze and become rigid, forming a crust and lithosphere (a crust that would be, at this stage, nothing like continents). It is well-understood that, over the next ten million years or so (and continuing at an ever-decreasing rate all the way to the present), the enormous tides raised by such a close moon cause a gravitational interaction that slows the Earth?s rotation and boosts the Moon to a higher orbit. What has not been studied in detail is the consequence of this for the shape of the Earth itself and for the deformation experienced by the rocky outer shell of the Earth as it changes shape. A rapidly spinning planet flattens significantly into a shape with a large equatorial bulge so that just after the Moon formed, the radius of the Earth through the equator may have been twice as large as that through the poles. As the length of day increases and the equatorial diameter decreases, this puts the entire equatorial region into a state of compressive stress that will thicken the lithosphere, driving possibly water-bearing material (that has interacted with the steam-rich early atmosphere) to depths where it undergoes another stage of melting, the products of which should resemble continental crust. In order to study these phenomena in detail, investigators will create a series of computer codes necessary to describe rapidly rotating planets and the melting and crystallization processes they experience. The team will document and release these codes to the scientific community for use in numerous other studies. They also intend to develop educational and outreach resources based on the unique and dramatic series of events that our planet experienced at its birth. This work will involve advanced scientific and professional training for a postdoctoral scholar as well as undergraduate research experiences.<br/><br/>The numerical models that will be used to explore the consequences of rotational evolution on the early Earth include HERCULES, alphaMELTS, Perple_X, and custom advection-diffusion codes. HERCULES solves the hydrostatic equations of planetary structure in a frame that does not assume spherical symmetry or small perturbations thereto. It is able to accurately describe pressure, density, and gravity in a planet with arbitrarily fast rotation rate up to its stability limit (where angular acceleration at the equator exactly cancels gravity). HERCULES will be improved for this project to incorporate a wider range of equations of state. Extents of melting as a function of latitude and the composition and thickness of proto-crust will then be computed in the structures predicted by HERCULES using the pMELTS calibration, implemented in alphaMELTS for MATLAB or Python (tools developed with NSF geoinformatics support). The next stage is to move from statics to dynamics and calculate deformation rates and mechanisms using tectonophysics codes that incorporate elastic-plastic rheologies, brittle failure and viscous flow.  Knowing the type of faults that are predicted and the amplitude of motion, the investigators can describe the pressure-temperature paths that protocrustal material will experience using advection-diffusion models. Finally, along those P-T paths Perplex_X pseudosections will be utilized to predict where felsic melts will form and whether the resulting crust will be buoyantly stable and likely to survive long enough to be eroded at the surface and create detrital zircons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In English, intonation conveys discourse meaning, marking the distinction between a question and a statement, expressing the speaker's uncertainty or surprise, or highlighting informative words. These meanings are conveyed through complex patterns in pitch and other acoustic features, across the words in the sentence. Understanding how an intonation system works requires a detailed description of the intonation patterns that speakers produce, and an account of the elements that are perceptually salient: Is the pitch pattern of every word in a sentence potentially meaningful, and if not, which intonational features and which regions of the sentence are more (or less) critical for conveying discourse meaning? A further question is whether listeners pay attention to subtle variation in intonational features as marking corresponding distinctions in broad categories like 'question' or 'information focus', or alternatively, whether they attend to coarse-grained distinctions in intonation as cues to the broad meaning categories, while perceiving fine-grained variation as cues to speaker identity or psychological state. Understanding the mapping between intonation and meaning is important for theories of speech communication, cognition, the brain, and language learning. It has applications in clinical domains related to speech, hearing, and the brain, and for enhanced computer speech technologies that can process expressive spoken language.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify the elements of phrasal intonation that are perceived in heard speech and encoded in long-term memory representations. These representations are tapped through tasks where listeners reproduce the intonation of a heard utterance. Experiments will test 24 distinct intonational ""tunes"" proposed for English in the Autosegmental-Metrical theory of English intonation. In eight experiments, the participant's task of reproducing intonation is manipulated in three ways: using model sentences with more complex intonational patterns and variable lexical and syntactic content; introducing a time delay or an intervening speech task between hearing the model sentence and reproducing the intonation pattern; with information about the immediately preceding discourse and social context that support the interpretation of intonational meaning. Analyses of dynamic acoustic measures will test the similarity of reproduced intonation patterns to corresponding stimuli, revealing the phonetic granularity of intonational representations along dimensions related to pitch, loudness, tempo, and voice quality, and whether individuals vary in the intonational features they reproduce. The findings will resolve long-standing questions about intonational representation, informing linguistic theories of intonation and its meaning, and advancing intonation research with a novel experimental paradigm that can be used in studies of other languages, with no requirements on written language or the explicit definition of intonational meaning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although energy sector and agricultural sources are major contributors, natural microbiological sources account for roughly half of total global methane emissions.  Microbial methane production has long been assumed to be an anoxic process, carried out only under conditions of extremely low to zero oxygen. Recent research has demonstrated the potential for microbial methane production to occur in oxygenated upper waters of lakes and oceans through a previously unappreciated metabolic pathway present in microorganisms.  Under conditions of phosphorus deficiency, certain bacteria can utilize otherwise unreactive organic molecules known as methylphosphonates to meet their phosphorus requirements, releasing methane in the process.  The extent to which this mechanism supports the out-gassing of methane from lakes to the atmosphere is unknown, as are the consequences of changing environmental conditions upon it.  This project will address this knowledge gap by investigating the distributions, rates of and controls on aerobic methane production in Flathead Lake and 18 other Montana lakes of varying phosphorus deficiency status.  Because atmospheric deposition of pollutant nitrogen and deliberate measures to curtail phosphorus inputs to lakes can both lead to phosphorus deficiency, it is crucial that we know whether these factors may have the unexpected consequence of enhancing methane emissions.  This research will also directly support the education, field and laboratory experiences of graduate and undergraduate students and will provide training to local high school teachers from Native American (Kootenai and Salish) tribal lands.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate temporal and spatial variability in microbially-mediated, oxic methane production across lakes with varying phosphorus availability in western Montana. It is guided by the overarching hypothesis: diffusive effluxes of methane from oxic freshwater lakes are directly influenced by the nature and severity of ecosystem nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus) deficiencies. A combination of observational and experimental approaches employing chemical, stable isotopic, metagenomic and PCR-based gene analyses will be used to examine: 1) time and space variability in the concentration, stable isotope composition, and net production of methane in freshwater lakes in Montana, focusing on Flathead Lake; 2) The extent to which microbial methylphosphonate degradation results in net production of methane in these lakes; 3) The functional diversity, abundances, and transcriptional activities of microorganisms involved in both phosphonate and methane cycling; and 4) How the stoichiometry (specifically nitrogen:phosphorus ratios) of aquatic nutrient (inorganic and total) pools influences oxic methane production and expression of methane cycling functional genes. The study will provide a systematic evaluation of microbial methane sources and the potential contribution of methylphosphonate degradation as a source of methane in oxic freshwater lakes. Results from this project will provide new insights and advance current understanding of coupled interactions between carbon and phosphorus cycling in freshwater lake habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology is able to track blood-oxygen-level dependent signals over time and serve as a proxy to neural activity. Current approaches have limitations, as they assume that the interdependence between distinct brain regions is constant throughout recording periods. These approaches also assume that the brain is an isolated system that does not consider outside stimulus. To capture the highly complex dynamics and to enable the understanding of the neural basis of human cognition this research project will develop new data analysis methods for processing brain activity to explain the relationships involved in attention, learning, memory, decision-making, and language. This multidisciplinary effort will also enable the training of a new generation of engineers and clinicians, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups, who can use the new data analytics to aid them during decision-making to assess the brain?s health enabling earlier diagnostics. The results of this research will have a great impact on healthcare and benefit the U.S. economy and society.<br/> <br/>To capture the highly complex spatiotemporal brain activity, this grant supports development of a model-based approach that captures the non-stationarity and fractal behavior of the brain dynamics. As a consequence, it will unveil dynamical characteristics that can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively measure how well an individual is doing in a particular task (e.g., attention/memory). Furthermore, the model-based approach in this project lays down the framework to perform control where quantitative measures can be used to establish control objectives regarding success in performing a given task. Unlike currently employed short-range memory models, this project focuses on a generalized mathematical framework that captures the degree of a memory of brain activity. Thus, the research will provide new insights and information about the brain organization and cognition that may fundamentally change the way one examines neuro-related data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three decades of monitoring using GPS has revealed that the southwestern part of Puerto Rico is moving independently from the rest of the island. This work will add to the understanding of how the island is deforming before and after the earthquake sequence in addition to understanding earthquake displacements. The project supports a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and includes significant outreach to the local community related to these seismic events.<br/><br/>Since December 29, 2020,the southwestern region of the Puerto Rico-Virgin Islands microplate has been hit by an extensive earthquake swarm, with several magnitude 5 earthquakes and a mainshock of 6.4 that occurred on January 7, 2020. The region has seen significant devestation, a displaced population and anxiety with the continued sequence. Several faults have been identified in the region. However, the most probable causative fault has been recently discovered, the North Boqueron-Punta Montalva fault. Instrumenting the fault is critical to assess seismic and tsunami risk in the region. This project will re-measure all 18 campaign GPS sites in the PRVI tectonic block and install 6 temporary real-time GNSS sites. The goal is to quantify the motion of the southwestern Puerto Rico block and understand which faults are accommodating motion. The geodetic data that is collected will help researchers to estimate how the recent seismic activity is associated with elastic strain accumulation on the landward extension of the fault.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data are expected to be processed in real-time in many time sensitive IoT applications, which is extremely challenging if not impossible with existing centralized cloud. For example, self-driving cars generate around 10GB of data per mile. Transmitting such massive data from end devices (such as self-driving cars) to the centralized cloud and expecting timely processing are not realistic with limited bandwidth between the end users and the centralized cloud. A distributed computing system, where computationally intensive aspects are distributively and securely processed at the end devices with possible help from edge servers (close to end-devices) and the cloud, might be a better approach to solving this problem. In this context, this award investigates practical distributed computing mechanisms that securely harvest heterogeneous resources including computing power, storage, battery, networking resources, etc., scattered across end devices, edge servers, and cloud.<br/><br/>This project represents a unique attempt to explore the opportunities, as well as the limitations, of the new theory of coded computation, which studies the design of erasure and error-correcting codes through data redundancy, from a practical perspective in future distributed computing systems.

While some fraction of the generated coal ash is recycled, mostly for the cement industry, over half is stored in coal ash impoundments and landfills. Since coal ash contains high concentrations of heavy metals that are easily transported into water, the disposal of coal ash in leaky impoundments can damage the environment and water resources. Hurricane storms and large floods have been shown to cause spills of coal ash into Sutton Lake in eastern North Carolina and contamination of the lake ecological system. This NSF project seeks to detect coal ash contamination in sediments within different lakes throughout North Carolina and to evaluate the possible environmental impacts of coal ash in these lakes. The project will develop novel methods to detect coal ash in the environment. Understanding the potential occurrence of coal ash outside the major disposal sites and the ecological impact in the lakes is important for the communities living near coal ash ponds and the impacted lakes. The use of scientific methods to detect coal ash in the environment is important for an unbiased and scientific-base evaluation of the risks of coal ash to residents living in rural areas of North Carolina.  <br/><br/>The proposed study aims to collect sediments and pore water samples from lakes near major coal ash disposal sites in North Carolina in order to detect the presence of coal ash and its impact on the ecosystem. The study is based on developing novel geochemical and physical methods for tracing coal ash and its contaminants in the environment through integration of independent proxies for the presence of coal ash in the bottom sediments including trace metals distribution, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr), lead stable isotopes (206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/206Pb), radionuclides (228Ra, 226Ra, 210Pb, 137Cs), magnetic susceptibility, and magnetic granulometry. This reconnaissance study will investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of coal ash and contaminants likely introduced during extreme hydrologic events into lakes near coal ash storage impoundments in North Carolina. The study will also evaluate the mobilization of contaminants from coal ash solids into the ecosystem through leaching experiments and measurement of pore water from the lake bottom sediments. The objectives of the study are (1) to develop methods for identification of coal ash in sediments and associated contaminants in pore water extracted from lake bottom sediments; (2) to evaluate the magnitude of unmonitored coal ash spills in the impacted lakes; (3) to determine the residence time of sediments in lakes impacted by coal ash spills; and (4) to evaluate the long-term ecological effects that could result from unmonitored coal ash spills into lakes in North Carolina.  The environmental legacy of coal ash is one of the emerging topics in the southeastern U.S. Leaking of coal ash ponds and spills have shown to have environmental effects on the quality of groundwater and surface water near coal ash disposal sites. The expected decommissioning of the operating coal-fired power plants during the next decade requires permanent solutions for the large volumes of coal ash commonly stored in coal ash impoundments near lakes and streams. The evidence of a coal ash spills to Sutton Lake has further raised public concerns about the environmental and human health safety. This NSF project will establish scientific-based criteria for environmental risks assessment associated with coal ash storage and management. Graduate and undergraduate students from Duke University, and undergraduate students from Appalachian State and Montclair State University will take active roles in the project. The results of the project will be used to construct a module on coal ash pollution to ?Water on the Move?, a K-12 outreach program in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Appalachian State. In addition to publication in scientific journals and presentation in professional conferences, the results of this project will be disseminated to the general public and communities living near coal ash impoundments and impacted lakes through press releases following scientific publication, communications with environmental NGOs working with the local communities, townhall meetings with communities at larger risks with direct dialogue with residents, a designated website and social media, communication and presentation of the results in federal (U.S. EPA, Congress) and state (NC House of Representatives) agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Medical technologies in particular can affect how doctors understand and treat illness, how patients access healthcare, and how societies define healthy bodies. When technologies enter a new context, their use and significance is shaped by the existing political, economic, and cultural conditions in that locale. At the same time, the broader global medical aims of the technology can also impact and change the local culture. This study examines the introduction of a significant new pharmaceutical treatment in reproductive healthcare to ask: how do biomedical technologies affect cultural meanings about bodies, health, and reproduction? Answering this question will provide important data about the interaction of technologies and medical care in new cultural contexts globally. This research will train a graduate student in scientific anthropology and science and technology studies. Findings will be shared with medical professionals, public health administration, and public policy experts in an effort to inform healthcare implementation and policies.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the social, historical, and cultural implications of the use of new medical technologies in women?s healthcare. The research will be focus on populations experiencing recent changes in healthcare law and practice to study how use of a new medical drug affects cultural beliefs about health, reproduction, and healthcare. The researchers will focus on the medical professionals, health and policy administrators, patients, and non-medical social actors who are implementing or experiencing the use of the new medicine. The researchers will visit hospitals and medical clinics, attend meetings of policy and healthcare non-profits, and conduct qualitative interviews across these populations to find out how this new technology is changing the practice of medicine and the culture surrounding reproductive healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference addresses this critically important topic, drawing on researchers from a range of disciplines and literatures. A robust finding across these literatures is that achievement gaps in math exist at preschool and largely persist through high school. Though it is clear that socio-economic status (SES) plays a significant role in producing these gaps, a better understanding of specific causal mechanisms is needed. Moreover, there may be other important home-based factors that could inoculate children, protecting them from lagging behind in mathematics upon school entry. The conference is a unique opportunity for researchers across disciplines to share the results of their cutting-edge work, receive feedback on the translational opportunities, and get a sense of how to move forward. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The conference has three aims: First, discussion around variability in HNE across age and culture; second, the development of a review of the extant literature on HNE (identifying gaps and future directions); and, third, the development of a better survey measure of HNE. The output of the conference will include a working paper that presents a coherent vision for the HNE research community.

While some fraction of the generated coal ash is recycled, mostly for the cement industry, over half is stored in coal ash impoundments and landfills. Since coal ash contains high concentrations of heavy metals that are easily transported into water, the disposal of coal ash in leaky impoundments can damage the environment and water resources. Hurricane storms and large floods have been shown to cause spills of coal ash into Sutton Lake in eastern North Carolina and contamination of the lake ecological system. This NSF project seeks to detect coal ash contamination in sediments within different lakes throughout North Carolina and to evaluate the possible environmental impacts of coal ash in these lakes. The project will develop novel methods to detect coal ash in the environment. Understanding the potential occurrence of coal ash outside the major disposal sites and the ecological impact in the lakes is important for the communities living near coal ash ponds and the impacted lakes. The use of scientific methods to detect coal ash in the environment is important for an unbiased and scientific-base evaluation of the risks of coal ash to residents living in rural areas of North Carolina.  <br/><br/>The proposed study aims to collect sediments and pore water samples from lakes near major coal ash disposal sites in North Carolina in order to detect the presence of coal ash and its impact on the ecosystem. The study is based on developing novel geochemical and physical methods for tracing coal ash and its contaminants in the environment through integration of independent proxies for the presence of coal ash in the bottom sediments including trace metals distribution, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr), lead stable isotopes (206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/206Pb), radionuclides (228Ra, 226Ra, 210Pb, 137Cs), magnetic susceptibility, and magnetic granulometry. This reconnaissance study will investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of coal ash and contaminants likely introduced during extreme hydrologic events into lakes near coal ash storage impoundments in North Carolina. The study will also evaluate the mobilization of contaminants from coal ash solids into the ecosystem through leaching experiments and measurement of pore water from the lake bottom sediments. The objectives of the study are (1) to develop methods for identification of coal ash in sediments and associated contaminants in pore water extracted from lake bottom sediments; (2) to evaluate the magnitude of unmonitored coal ash spills in the impacted lakes; (3) to determine the residence time of sediments in lakes impacted by coal ash spills; and (4) to evaluate the long-term ecological effects that could result from unmonitored coal ash spills into lakes in North Carolina.  The environmental legacy of coal ash is one of the emerging topics in the southeastern U.S. Leaking of coal ash ponds and spills have shown to have environmental effects on the quality of groundwater and surface water near coal ash disposal sites. The expected decommissioning of the operating coal-fired power plants during the next decade requires permanent solutions for the large volumes of coal ash commonly stored in coal ash impoundments near lakes and streams. The evidence of a coal ash spills to Sutton Lake has further raised public concerns about the environmental and human health safety. This NSF project will establish scientific-based criteria for environmental risks assessment associated with coal ash storage and management. Graduate and undergraduate students from Duke University, and undergraduate students from Appalachian State and Montclair State University will take active roles in the project. The results of the project will be used to construct a module on coal ash pollution to ?Water on the Move?, a K-12 outreach program in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Appalachian State. In addition to publication in scientific journals and presentation in professional conferences, the results of this project will be disseminated to the general public and communities living near coal ash impoundments and impacted lakes through press releases following scientific publication, communications with environmental NGOs working with the local communities, townhall meetings with communities at larger risks with direct dialogue with residents, a designated website and social media, communication and presentation of the results in federal (U.S. EPA, Congress) and state (NC House of Representatives) agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, researchers have equated mobility with foraging practices while equating sedentary life, which features permanent or semi-permanent settlement, with agriculture. Recent research, however, suggests that this may be a false dichotomy, that agriculture and sedentism may not necessarily be linked, and that there may exist a diversity of ways in which groups can practice agriculture. Archaeological research is well situated to investigate the relationship between agriculture, sedentism, and food processing because it can document and compare the ways in which different human groups living in different local environments undergo cultural change over long periods. Krista Dotzel and Dr. Kevin McBride will investigate these issues by researching to understand past indigenous foraging and maize farming communities and their relationships to mobility and sedentism in Southern New England, USA. Radiocarbon dates produced for this research will help other researchers better understand the cultural chronology of the region. By disseminating this research at public and academic venues, this work will help public and academic communities to better understand both the variability of agricultural practices of indigenous American societies in pre-contact North America and more generally the diverse ways in which societies adopt and use crops within their communities. <br/><br/>This research will investigate the spread of maize, bean, and squash and the changing role of maize in different communities within a single region by identifying the first appearances of these domesticated crops and by identifying changes in maize cooking and consumption practices. When domesticated crops are introduced into a society does this necessarily cause the society to develop sedentary settlements? If so, how long does it take for sedentism to develop? Do foraging societies that already practice sedentism incorporate domesticates into their societies faster than mobile societies? How do food processing and cooking techniques change over time and how might these relate to mobile or sedentary residence patterns? To investigate these questions, the researchers will analyze microscopic plant remains extracted from ancient food residues on ceramic pots spanning roughly 2,000 years from sites in Southern New England, USA. Societies in this region practiced diverse agricultural strategies and lived in communities that were mobile and sedentary to varying degrees. This cultural diversity will allow the researchers to examine these questions in depth through a comparative study. Using microscopic plant remains, researchers will identify the first appearance of maize, bean, and squash and, through comparing microscopic plant remains to whole plant seeds found at the sites, identify changes in the way that maize was cooked over time in different parts of the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their optical properties can be chemically controlled and they can form single crystals at low temperatures. Single crystals are a highly ordered form of condensed matter and enable high performance electronics and photonics. The aim of this project is to fabricate low-cost, high performance printed devices based on high-quality single crystals and single crystal microarrays of perovskites. The project will focus on direct printing of semiconductor single crystal pixels with chemically-tuned spectral properties on device-ready wafers. The PI will use a co-design strategy to simultaneously tackle single crystal growth and device integration. Direct writing of single crystal transistor and photodetector arrays on wafers will be a crucial step toward next-generation optoelectronic devices and circuits.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This multidisciplinary project seeks to advance the synthesis, processing, and device integration of hybrid metal halide (HMH) semiconductor materials by enabling the direct ink-based growth of single crystal-based optoelectronic devices and arrays thereof. The salt-like nature of HMH materials makes them a unique class of semiconductors with chemical diversity on par with organic semiconductors, crystalline order on par with conventional inorganic semiconductors, and superior transport and optoelectronic properties thanks in part to large spin-orbit coupling. This project will focus on developing synthetic and processing approaches which enable the formation of microscopic single crystals and arrays thereof at pre-determined locations on device-ready substrates using readily available printing and coating technologies. A co-design strategy will simultaneously tackle material formulation, surface chemistry, spectral properties and device performance to successfully and rapidly integrate semiconductor single crystals into (opto)electronic device components and arrays. A direct writing approaches will be developed to produce spectrally-tunable single crystal devices, including field-effect transistors and phototransistors, as well as conventional and polarization-sensitive photodetectors. This will be expanded to demonstrate wafer-scale integration of single crystal device microarrays. The scientific and engineering knowledge developed in this proposal will enable solution-processing to ultimately deliver materials of single crystal caliber without resorting to conventional ultrahigh vacuum techniques or epitaxial growth. The implementation of single crystal microarray fabrication through existing high throughput coating and printing infrastructure designed for traditional thin film coating is pursued for two main reasons: (I) mature platforms which co-integrate materials synthesis and device integration on the same substrate are suitable for co-design, and (II) broad adoption of manufacturing approaches is more likely given the available infrastructure across the nation. The proposed co-design strategy will provide intensification of experiments and assist in verifying scientific and engineering hypotheses crucial to the intended outcomes of this project. The research will raise a new generation of leaders in electronic materials processing and optoelectronic devices. Future career opportunities in these areas will be given to graduate and undergraduate students including women and underrepresented minorities. Dissemination of the research will take place through high impact publications, published datasets, and presentations for the scientific community, as well as through social media and hands-on activities in local K-12 schools, Citizen Science program at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science, and established outreach programs at North Carolina State University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study is focused on gaining a better understanding of how the ocean adjusts to variable winds, with particular focus on climatically important quantities such as ocean heat content and the MOC strength and pathways. A theoretical framework will be developed to better understand how these quantities depend on the controlling parameters, including mean stratification; region, structure, and frequency of wind variability; bottom topography; and mean state (including wind-driven gyres and a mean overturning circulation). The idealized approach adopted will allow for a general understanding of the controlling physics, including how they will vary in different oceans around the world, and in a future climate where the mean state and forcing variability might be different than at present. The results of this study will be  incorporated into graduate level classes and lectures at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)  Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School, and participation will be sought from undergraduate students through the WHOI Summer Student Fellow Program. This will provide training in numerical methods, applied mathematics, climate, and data analysis. Results from this work will be made available through the peer-reviewed literature, national and international meetings, and web page content.<br/> <br/>Despite its known importance for climate, there is currently no analytic theory for how transients in wind-forcing modify ocean heat storage and transport by the overturning circulation. This work will combine known features of the large-scale, low frequency ocean circulation, such as geostrophy, wave transients, and eddy fluxes, in a simple and compact way to represent climatically important integrated quantities such as ocean heat content and mass transports. The primary intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in developing a theoretical framework to connect regions of variable wind stress to remote ocean currents. This inevitably involves understanding how heat is stored and transported on both gyre- and global-scales in the ocean. The starting point is a linear theory based on isopycnal mass budgets in the interior subject to Sverdrup dynamics and Rossby and boundary wave transients. The predictions from the theory, and the importance of such nonlinear processes as outcropping, eddy fluxes, closed potential vorticity contours, and inertial western boundary currents, will be assessed with the use of idealized numerical models and published ocean state estimates from the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) consortium. Diagnostics from these more complete models will also be used to guide revisions to the linear theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These measurements comprise the longest continuous geochemical records of several key atmospheric trace gases and have direct relevance for understanding climate changes and related changes in land and ocean ecosystems at high northern latitudes.  CO2 not only is a critical greenhouse gas but its variations are diagnostic of photosynthesis and respiration of land ecosystems, such as tundra and forests, which support the food-web and health of Arctic ecosystems.  Related measurements of atmospheric species, such as O2 and the isotopes of CO2, complement and expand this knowledge base.  Previous measurements of atmospheric CO2 reveal clearly that dramatic changes have occurred in the cycling of carbon at high latitudes.  Larger changes are likely to occur in the decades ahead and models alone cannot inform our understanding of those outcomes.  Hence, atmospheric measurements comprise a key element of an observing system that will allow understanding of how fast and in what respect these systems are changing.  This project not only continues long-term flask measurements but also initiates new atmospheric measurements through in situ instrumentation to be installed at Utqiagvik, Alaska. <br/><br/>This project supports flask collections at Cold Bay and Utqiagvik, Alaska, and at Alert Station on Ellesmere Island.  The flasks will be returned to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where they will be analyzed for CO2 concentration, the stable isotopes of CO2, and the O2/N2 and Ar/N2 ratios.  The project will also support the installation and operation of an in situ O2/N2 analyzer system at Utqiagvik, Alaska.  This new installation will enable the study of O2 exchanges with the nearby Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas based on the ability to resolve short-term signals of regional origin.  Augmenting these data collection efforts, this project will support data analysis to detect and quantify long-term changes in the measured atmospheric trace gases, with a particular focus on changes in seasonal cycles.

The project stemmed from the need to implement an effective model for research-oriented undergraduate education which meets the needs of both students (from different academic majors, types of institutions - including community colleges, and who have completed from one to three years of undergraduate education) and their eventual employers (or graduate programs) in the emerging and changing nanotechnology sector. It responds to the need to recruit students from diverse populations, including under-represented groups, for enhancing diversity in STEM fields, and the need to enhance engineering education with a focus on emerging technology systems in the context of applications and societal impact.  This is accomplished through an approach which supports self-efficacy, multidisciplinary team-building, understanding broader impacts of technology, and building the skills necessary for research and life-long learning  through a program of faculty-mentored multidisciplinary research, professional development, and exposure to real-world issues which reflect the impact of nanotechnology on society, the business community, human health and the environment. <br/><br/>Over a three year period Stony Brook University will host a ten week, eight intern multidisciplinary nanotechnology REU Site focused on Nanotechnology in Health, Energy and the Environment, involving multiple engineering departments and administered by the University?s Center for Inclusive Education (CIE).  Providing real research experiences for undergraduates is a critical need for the successful education of the next generation of engineers and scientists.  The laboratories involved will provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, batteries, catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, nanoscale surface engineering to enhance recycling and ?green? manufacturing, and development of nanosensors.

They are comprised of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and single-celled eukaryotes. Microbiomes reside in every known ecosystem around the globe, including many plants and animals that also host microbiomes. Microbiome research is an area of deep interest and rapid discovery across multiple institutions in the USA. As a result, microbiome centers have been established at universities, research institutes, and national labs supporting local research and education. Microbiome research is interdisciplinary in nature, cutting across ecosystems and species and scaling from microscopic entities to human health to global cycles. It also encompasses a diversity of disciplines including computer science, chemistry, organismal biology, molecular biology and more, making communication and synthesis challenging.

The hard, calcified exoskeleton provides protection and support, but restricts growth. As a result, these animals must periodically shed the exoskeleton, a process called molting. Upon molting, animals stretch the new exoskeleton before it hardens, providing more space for tissue growth. The entire process is controlled by molting hormone produced by a pair of molting glands. The activity of the molting gland is controlled by environmental signals mediated by the nervous system. Much remains to be known about the signaling genes that control the molting gland, in particular the genes required for (1) committing the animal to molt and (2) repressing the molting gland after the animal molts. Commitment is a ?point of no return? decision that is critical for survival and growth in all crustaceans. Repression prevents molt induction until synthesis and calcification of the exoskeleton is completed. This collaborative project involves a team of investigators from four universities who will use state-of-art DNA and peptide sequencing technologies to identify genes and proteins essential for the activation, commitment, and repression of the molting gland and its regulation by environmental signals. The data generated will be made available to researchers so that they can better understand how to manage fisheries, develop effective aquaculture practices, and mitigate the effects of pollutants and climate change. Three postdoctoral fellows, four graduate students, and 6-8 undergraduates will receive training in advanced molecular techniques and bioinformatics. An educational outreach program for teachers recruited from junior high and high schools in northeastern Colorado will be developed.<br/><br/>In crustaceans, paired molting glands (Y-organs or YOs) produce ecdysteroids necessary for systemic molt cycle control. Molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), produced in the eyestalk ganglia, inhibits the synthesis of ecdysteroids by the YO via a putative G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and cyclic nucleotide second messengers. The project will use transcriptomic and proteomic tools to determine the signaling mechanisms that drive YO phenotypic changes over the molt cycle; these are designated basal in intermolt, activated in early premolt, committed in mid and late premolt, and repressed in postmolt. The specific aims are to: (1) determine how MIH signaling inhibits Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity; (2) determine the role of Transforming Growth Factor beta/Activin signaling in YO commitment; (3) determine the role of ecdysteroids on YO entry into, and exit from, the repressed state; and (4) characterize the MIH receptor. The first three aims will quantify the phenotypic effects of experimental signaling manipulations on YO state transitions. Network analysis of RNA-sequence and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry data will determine the effects of experimental treatments on gene interactions and downstream targets of signaling pathways. Aim #4 uses transcriptomic tools and a luciferase ligand/receptor binding assay with recombinant neuropeptides to characterize candidate GPCRs for receptor function. A thorough understanding of the hormonal regulation of decapod molting and growth is essential to manage fisheries, develop effective aquaculture practices, and mitigate potential effects of pollutants and environmental factors on an economically and ecologically important group of marine organisms.

It is becoming clear that the mechanisms that dictate both coexistence and evolution can influence each other and thus both should be studied together. This project fills a critical gap in our knowledge of such interactions by testing why evolution in response to competition sometimes promotes or sometimes hinders species coexistence leading to a loss of biodiversity. The approach is to combine novel experimental evolution methods with analyses from recent ecological theory. This research is important because it will create a stronger integration between two research fields, bridging evolution and community ecology, by providing a deep understanding of the interactions between processes that dictate both the creation and the maintenance of biodiversity. In addition, this project will provide opportunities to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science as well as create educational research kits, and teacher training workshops, that will be distributed to urban and rural high schools.  <br/><br/>Well known field observations suggest that evolution in response to competition should promote species coexistence, yet, theoretical models find a greater diversity of outcomes including evolution promoting competitive exclusion. To understand why evolution sometimes hinders or promotes coexistence, this research project will fill critical empirical gaps by conducting manipulative field evolution experiments combined with analyses from the modern coexistence theory framework. Using two common species of duckweed, rapidly reproducing floating aquatic plants, this project will test how evolutionary coexistence dynamics are dictated by niche differences (processes that promote stable coexistence), by competitive ability differences (processes that promote competitive exclusion), and their evolutionary potential (genetic variance). Specifically, it will first quantify variation in niche and competitive ability differences and in their genetic variance among natural populations of duckweed. Then using experimental evolution in field mesocosms, it will test how these properties evolve in response to competition in each population. In addition, this research will quantify the relative importance of niche and competitive ability differences in driving evolutionary coexistence dynamics. Together, this project will test the feedback between competition, evolution, and coexistence acting through niche and competitive ability differences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its widespread use, a basic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie successful graft combinations is lacking, making it impossible to precisely predict beneficial graft combinations. Research conducted on this project will help elucidate the mechanisms that underlie communication between grafted root and shoot systems. Progress in this area has the potential to transform the practice of grafting into a more precise science, enabling scientists and farmers to rapidly adapt crops to combat new diseases, handle environmental fluctuations, and restructure growth habits for improved crop productivity. In addition to providing research training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher, the project will emphasize science communication, and students will help design and host public workshops on plant grafting. Related undergraduate training will be offered through the implementation of a novel visual and experiential learning pedagogy, based on 3-dimensional X-ray imaging and other hands-on image capture activities, for Cornell?s introductory undergraduate botany course. <br/><br/>Long-distance signaling is known to play a fundamental role in the growth and stress response mechanisms in plants, as well as related processes including grafting, and thus is critical from an agricultural point of view. Unfortunately, the processes underlying these signaling pathways remain poorly understood, even at the most basic level. A prime example involves the role of mRNAs in long-distance signaling, which until recently were assumed to function almost exclusively within the cells where they are produced. However, new studies that rely on polymorphism-based detection of mobile transcripts between heterografted root and shoot systems demonstrate that a large number of distinct RNA species move across distant organ systems. The potential significance of this plant ?mobileome? is a heavily debated topic, with widespread disagreement over whether mobile RNAs represent a collection of long-distance signals or are simply noise in the vascular system. Much of this controversy is due to the lack of fundamental knowledge about how the plant mobileome works. The research objectives of this proposal are: 1) to resolve the fundamental question of whether mRNAs play a crucial role in long-distance signaling and grafting; 2) to more generally explore the mobility of mRNA in plants; and 3) to further our understanding of the mechanisms of transport as a means to realize the long-term goal of engineering and deploying artificial mRNAs to confer agriculturally desirable traits. These goals will be achieved through the production of novel genomic resources, and the use of temporal sampling, computational genomics, and high-resolution, in vivo RNA imaging, which will ultimately provide insight into the dynamic behavior of long-distance RNA movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The basic earthquake parameters determined in a CMT analysis represent primary observations of the earthquake source process and provide valuable constraints for modeling and interpretation of global and regional tectonic activity. The CMT parameters allow description and prediction of global ground motion due to an earthquake.

This research project will use sea anemones, whose ancestors split off from all other animal lineages over 600 million years ago, to reconstruct the deep evolutionary history of neural development in animals. The resultant knowledge will contribute to the understanding of nervous system evolution in two ways: (1) it will provide fundamental insights into developmental mechanisms that were critical for the origin of nervous systems over 600 million years ago, and 2) it will provide new information about how these mechanisms have diversified in the intervening time period. This project will additionally broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM by actively involving minority undergraduate students directly in research through participation in the Undergraduate Student Mentoring Program of Arkansas INBRE (IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence). Furthermore, the research will strengthen both the research and educational environments at the University of Arkansas by using a unique, non-traditional animal model system that makes it easy give students first-hand experience with cutting-edge biological technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, Next Generation Sequencing, and confocal microscopy. The research will advance fundamental knowledge about the origin and evolution of nervous systems, as well as benefit society through basic science research and education.<br/> <br/>In bilaterian animals (e.g. mice, worms and flies), the class IV POU homeodomain transcription factor (POU-IV or Brn-3) plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating neural subtype differentiation and maintenance. However, it is unclear whether the conservation of POU-IV function extends beyond Bilateria, or whether divergent, novel regulatory mechanisms exist in non-bilaterian animal groups with nervous systems such as Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfish, corals and sea anemones) ? the sister group of Bilateria. To address this problem, the research will dissect the structure and function of the POU-IV gene regulatory network in the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Specifically, this project will focus on 1) defining neural subtypes specified by POU-IV by combining in-depth gene expression analyses with gene function analyses via CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, and 2) dissecting the structure of the POU-IV gene regulatory network underpinning neural fate specification by combining gene function perturbation, ChIP-seq, and transcriptome analyses.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Organization Program of the Neural Systems Cluster, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groundwater is also an indispensable resource for energy production, agricultural and industrial uses. A karst aquifer is a special type of aquifer that is formed in regions underlain by soluble rocks, typically carbonate rocks. Karst aquifers hold 40% of U.S. groundwater. The dissolution of soluble rocks through time creates a complex groundwater flow system in karst aquifers, which is typically characterized by a network of fractures and conduits that connect to the surface water through sinkholes, sinking streams, and springs.  Those characteristics make karst aquifers potentially vulnerable to both climate change and contamination. The proposed research seeks to enhance understanding of the complex network of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in order to advance the prediction of water flow, surface water and groundwater interaction, contaminant transport, nutrient cycle,  and the carbon cycle in many karst aquifers under increased stresses from human activities.  This project will also greatly benefit the economically distressed karst Appalachian region where students are underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This project is jointly funded by the Hydrologic Sciences (HS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This research will be centered on conducting collaborative research using a complementary data fusion approach. The approach fuses data collected from hydraulic tomography, river stage tomography, electrical resistivity tomography, and tracer tests to produce a more reliable map of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in a cost-effective manner. In turn, the results will lead to improved understanding and prediction of flow and solute transport in the karst aquifers.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate an innovative approach for characterizing karst aquifers in detail based on the data fusion concept. To achieve this goal, this research will design two new field surveys: surface and subsurface river stage tomography and electrical resistivity tomography with moving current sources. This research will also explore the feasibility of natural lightning tomography for large-scale resistivity surveys. The data collected from these surveys will be integrated into a geostatistical-based inversion framework to characterize the distribution and morphology of fractures and conduits with great detail. The fusion approach will be tested and validated at the Cane Run Royal Spring Basin in central Kentucky. The validity of the characterized karst aquifers will be evaluated using a separate model with the field-collected water level, water chemistry, tracer, and stable isotope data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By attenuating flow and modulating flow turbulence, SAV promotes sediment stability, provides food and shelter for numerous important species and improves water quality. SAV thus forms a critical link between physical habitat and biological communities. Flexible SAV blades interact with the flow field and with each other in complex, but ecologically significant ways. For example, above a critical flow velocity threshold, continuous SAV canopy motion (monami) occurs, which is associated with the abundance of attached algae on SAV. To date, our understanding of how SAV structure affects flow attenuation and mass transport is still limited, and physical interactions among vegetation blades are not included explicitly in most observational efforts, theoretical analyses or modeling studies. This project will develop an integrated modeling framework supported by field observations and experiments. The new model will support engineers and natural resources managers tasked with developing legally mandated minimum flow requirements for springs restoration. The project supports two PhD students, who will receive interdisciplinary training in hydrodynamic modeling, aquatic ecology, and data analysis. A hands-on outreach activity and K-12 lesson plan will be developed using a portable racetrack flume at the UF Coastal Lab.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this study is to quantify the influence of vegetation structural properties and blade-to-blade interactions on hydrodynamics and characterize the collective behavior of flexible vegetation canopies under different flow conditions. The study develops a structural solver that integrates soft-body dynamics into a finite element model to investigate the deformation of vegetation blades and interactions between multiple blades. The structural model will be coupled with a computational fluid dynamics model to study flow over interacting submerged flexible vegetation. Field observations in multiple Florida springs will be carried out, in which velocimeters and video cameras will collect hydrodynamics and vegetation canopy data (such as effective vegetation heights and monami characteristics). The model will be validated with observational data, and then used to identify different flow regimes based on vegetation structural properties and flow conditions. This project will develop an improved parameterization of the effects of SAV on hydrodynamics on river reach-scale using observation data and model results, which can be implemented in large-scale modeling framework to study the effects of SAV on key ecosystem processes, such as sediment transport and algae growth dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Findings from this work will advance our understanding of robot assisted teamwork. Further the project will develop educational activities that allow children and students to develop the skills necessary to succeed in a work environment that includes robots. <br/><br/>While most work is performed by groups and teams, research on human-robot collaboration has focused predominantly on dyadic interactions, i.e. a single human collaborating with a single robot.

In particular: 1) how a robot's behavior influences both human-robot interactions and human-human interpersonal interactions in a group of people, 2) how robots can deliberately shape human-human interpersonal interactions, and 3) what the consequences of such influence are for a team's overall effectiveness. This project investigates how a robot's resource allocation behavior impacts people's interactions with each other and their ability to perform as a team. Allocation behavior refers to behavior associated with a robot's allocation of resources and tasks between several people (e.g. handing over a tool or building block to a team member, allocating social attention and gaze, or providing assistance). This project will: 1) use lab and field studies to develop basic understanding about allocation behavior exhibited by people and robots and how such behavior affects a group's interaction, 2) use an iterative design approach combined with an online and laboratory based task to develop and evaluate allocation behaviors for robots to shape a group's interaction in desirable ways, and 3) examine how a robot's resource allocation behavior during collaborative tasks affects all dimensions of team effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This roadmap will be focused on the engineering of biology to produce, augment, and improve materials for a broad swath of applications. The roadmap will consist of technical and application challenges, innovative technical goals, and concrete but ambitious milestones for tool and technology development that build a path toward achieving the goals and overcoming the challenges. Creating a successful roadmap consists of a synergistic process of structured scoping, drafting, discussion, review, and revision of material.

These workshops are an invaluable part of achieving a roadmap that represents the diverse views of researchers and those that support future research programs.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>To support the production of a materials roadmap for engineering biology, EBRC seeks financial support for two, 2-day writing workshops. Of particular importance in producing a materials roadmap is the engagement of a diverse group of scientists and engineers from the materials research community, who may or may not have experience or expertise in engineering biology. These individuals encourage a holistic approach to understanding and reporting the unique challenges of producing usable, effective, and functional materials, and will be enlisted as workshop participants, draft contributors, and community reviewers. Past EBRC writing workshops have proven to be incredibly productive in bringing together experts and stakeholders to draft, review, and revise the roadmap content and substance. Financial support will help to cover costs of participant travel, accommodations, meals and expenses and any necessary facility and support fees.

Drawing on two survey experiments, this project examines influences on individuals? perceptions of incivility and whether exposure to incivility encourages individuals to participate. Investigating these phenomena will reveal to what extent the negative outcomes of incivility are overstated, and to what extent there are positive outcomes of incivility. <br/><br/>This study of political incivility advances research in political communication, political psychology, and public opinion. Existing scholarship tends to treat political incivility as some objective phenomena that is responded to in similar manners across different contexts.

Developing next-generation batteries requires a thorough understanding of complex material behavior and failures of the primary constituents, electrodes and their interfaces, to ensure the safety and durability of devices. This research will enable a fundamental understanding of the electro-chemo-mechanical behavior of electrodes and interfaces at multiple scales by developing modeling and simulation capabilities. The effort will lead to the discovery of electrochemical degradation mechanisms in electrodes and guide their design, ultimately enabling the development of high-capacity electrodes and benefitting the US economy. The grant also supports interrelated education and outreach activities that integrate research and innovative teaching approaches. These activities include curriculum development for a new Batteries and Energy Storage Technologies minor program, design of senior capstone projects, and multiple K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach events at the University of Nevada, Reno.<br/><br/>To understand the electro-chemo-mechanics of electrodes and interfaces, the research approach will achieve three specific objectives: 1) identify and characterize the cooperative and competitive roles of heterogeneities in stress-mediated (de)lithiation kinetics with the effect of charge by combining atomistic reaction pathway modeling and molecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field, 2) identify how defects and mechanical stress affect pore formation/annihilation during electrochemical (de)lithiation by accounting for deformation kinematics in amorphous and open material systems and by coupling phase field modeling with finite strain elastoplasticity, 3) evaluate the interaction between the reaction kinetics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces with the chemo-mechanics of electrodes and electrochemical performance at the battery cell level, via a Butler-Volmer type approach that integrates reaction kinetics, ion transport, and the influence of mechanics.

The MedIX REU Site runs for three summers, with ten student participants doing research ten weeks each summer under the supervision of five mentors dedicated to undergraduate research. The REU Site is hosted by two interdisciplinary laboratories: the Medical Informatics Laboratory at DePaul University and the Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago. The research environment offers the students the opportunity to interact with computer scientists, medical physicists, and medical doctors. <br/><br/>All of the projects are inspired by state-of-the-art research questions in medical informatics and will address issues related to the coordinated, workflow-driven acquisition of image data in an electronic medical record environment and the subsequent processing of the image and clinical report text information. Students work as part of faculty-undergraduate teams on new problems ranging from traditional image processing (e.g., computer-aided diagnosis for lung cancer, breast density assessment, age-related macular degeneration prognosis) to structured reporting and natural language processing of radiology reports to visualization and annotation of images from multiple imaging modalities using novel computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science algorithms. Ultimately, this REU site will help support students interested in medical informatics and broaden participation in computer science. In addition, each project has the long-term potential to improve the accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the consumers of this information, notably radiologists.

In particular, the field of education research is experiencing a revolution in methodology due to the increasing digitization of the learning process. The Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) is a key player in effecting this change. This project will support a Doctoral Consortium at the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) 2020 conference, run by SoLAR, to be held in Frankfurt, Germany.  Participating in the consortium will prepare current doctoral students from diverse research backgrounds that make up the interdisciplinary field of Learning Analytics (LA), including computer science, information science, psychology, communication, education, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. It will also allow them to network with each other and with professors and practitioners who are currently engaged in learning analytics research and related work to ensure the continued development of this community. These activities are critical and timely. The upcoming generation of LA researchers will play a vital role in realizing the potential of using data to improve outcomes for elementary, secondary, and post-secondary students in learning, motivation, and perseverance.<br/><br/>LA is an interdisciplinary field whose goal is to advance and apply knowledge about learning sciences and education to improve all aspects of learning. Learning Analytics methods include data visualization, data mining, data science, and mixed methods approaches combining qualitative and quantitative methods (e.g., interviews and back-end, clickstream data analysis). Capacity building is a central concern within the LA community. SoLAR has historically addressed these needs, in part, through specialized workshops held in conjunction with the Society's major conference. The Doctoral Consortium workshops host PhD students who are grappling with their dissertation research. This grant provides travel support to US scholars selected through a competitive application process to participate in this event. They present their work for feedback both in the context of workshop, where they receive advice from a panel of expert mentors, and in a poster session in which they interact with the full conference audience. In addition, their work is published in the proceedings of the conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports participation in GLaMP 2020 to be held June 24-26, 2020 at Oberlin College and GLaMP 2021 to be held June 25-27, 2021 (dates tentative) at Michigan State University. Mathematical physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is very active worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in this country. The GLaMP conferences meet the need for a regular annual meeting in mathematical physics in the US, specifically in the greater Midwest. The main goals of the meetings are: (1) to provide a forum for young researchers in mathematical physics in the US to present their research, as well as to foster their professional development; (2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States; (3) to encourage participation by women and under-represented groups in the field of mathematical physics; and (4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. Besides its location, the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on promoting and showcasing the scientific work of young researchers (graduate and advanced undergraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty) in the field. <br/><br/>The GLaMP 2020 and 2021 conferences each consist of a three-lecture mini-course (one lecture each day) on a topic of current high-profile interest, five invited 50-minute plenary talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, and sessions of short 20-minute contributed talks given primarily by young researchers. To increase the visibility and participation by women and under-represented groups in mathematics, the organizers strive to have at least half of the invited plenary talks (including the mini course) be given by researchers from these under-represented groups. As in the past, the organizers will hold the meetings in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). To further highlight the focus of the meeting on the support of young researchers in their professional development, each GLaMP conference features a roundtable discussion on early-career development. The panel of the round table consists of researchers representing both careers in different types of academic institutions (for instance, private and public research universities, four-year liberal arts colleges), as well as in industry. <br/><br/>Details about the meetings will be posted on the conference websites: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2020 (for GLaMP 2020) and https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2021 (for GLaMP 2021).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their diversity, productivity and abundance have a huge influence on fisheries. For example, seasonal increases in phytoplankton biomass caused by the surge of deep ocean nutrient rich waters into the upper sunlit layers in the Equatorial Indian Ocean lead to an increase in tuna stocks. However, non-periodic increases of sea surface temperatures in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge region in the eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean, a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, weakens deep ocean water surge, which seems to alter phytoplankton community structure and to reduce phytoplankton?s productivity to the detriment of tuna stocks. Yet, the impact from such unpredictable events is not fully understood. This project investigates the impacts of an ongoing Indian Ocean Dipole, one of the most severe on record, on phytoplankton. The broader impacts of the project relate to its value to inform fisheries management plans in that area. Data derived from this study is valuable to understand and predict wider changes in the food web in a region that is coming under increasing pressures of global warming. All the data is made publicly available.<br/><br/>The research team is working with South Korean collaborators to understand how changes in phytoplankton biomass and in deep chlorophyll maxima may be linked to changes in phytoplankton productivity and growth rates due nutrient and/or iron limitation as a result of the weakening of deep-water upwelling. The team is also investigating the impact of the dipole event on cell size of dominating phytoplankton populations. Finally, they are testing if the phytoplankton community rely primarily on recycled as opposed to new nitrogenous nutrients for photosynthesis and growth during dipole events. The hypotheses are tested through extensive biological, hydro-chemical and biogeochemical measurements that include: 1) microscopic, Flow Cytometry, FlowCAM and HPLC pigment based analysis of phytoplankton biomass, community composition and size structure and Fast Repetition Rate based measurements of phytoplankton photosynthetic competency along a cruise  track and different depths in the water column, and 2) on-deck incubation based photosynthesis and nutrient uptake experiments. In situ measurements and sample collection is carried out as part of the Korea-US inDian Ocean Scientific (KUDOS) Research Program cruise (April-May 2020) on board the Korea Institute of Ocean Sciences and Technology Ship R/V Isabu, one of the only multi-disciplinary oceanographic cruises planned for the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge region during the dipole event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After the after the 2018 caldera collapse, there were large lava flow outpourings at the East Rift Zone and a shift to explosive behavior. Researchers see the connection between those events as a trend that occurred in the past and may repeat. Work will include olivine geochemistry and diffusion chronometry to address three questions: 1) what is the role crustal versus mantle inputs in the transition to an explosive phase at Kilauea? 2) what is the effect of caldera collapse on the system on the plumbing feeding subsequent eruptions? 3) over what time scale does the transition from effusive to dominantly explosive eruptions take place? This project will provide an early career researcher with experience managing and running a large research project at an academic institution. Exercises will be developed on effusive vs. explosive eruptions for use during K-12 classroom sessions through the non-profit program Skype a Scientist, bringing STEM enrichment to schools across the country. This project will emphasize advancing scientific understanding of explosive volcanic eruptions to better evaluate hazard potentials for this type of eruptive behavior. Finally, these data will inform on pre-eruptive warning signs for future explosive eruptions in Hawaii, further developing the potential for geochemical methods to be used as monitoring and predictive tools.<br/> <br/>Repeated patterns in mineral and lava geochemistry from 1500 C.E. to present suggest that explosive periods are controlled by fundamentally different crustal processes than effusive periods and are intimately linked to cycles of basaltic caldera collapse. This project will investigate the causes of protracted explosive volcanism at Kilauea by examining the geochemistry of lavas and tephra from the Uwekahuna Ash, a 1200-year period of explosive activity. Mineral compositions and zoning patterns will be used to determine the timescales of magma mixing and storage. Glass major and trace element geochemistry will be used to characterize mantle source composition, partial melting, and the flux of magma into the volcanic system. Combined with existing datasets for eruptions spanning 1500-present day, these analyses will be used to look for ? and evaluate the causes of ? repeating patterns in the geochemical record over the past 2,500 years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the contributions of two major sources of information to decision-making: any available information on the reward that an action will produce, and the history of rewards obtained from taking this action in the past. The extent to which decision makers rely on either of these sources of information is fundamental to understanding commonly observed choice patterns that economize on learning: Present information is often (at least partially) ignored and substituted for by relying on prior experience. Recent advances in economics model this trade-off, but do not typically provide an account of prior experience. Neuroscience and artificial intelligence, however, provide an account of learning from prior experience which is relevant to the formation of habits, for instance. This project aims to combine neuroscientific and economic accounts in one coherent theoretical framework, and to quantify experimentally the extent to which decisions rely on present information and prior experience, respectively. Such a measurement is crucial for understanding the circumstances under which a decision maker reassesses a recurring decision and breaks a habit. It will suggest policies that help incentivize decision makers to make deliberate decisions rather than following persistent habits. This is of great importance given the central role habits play in anxiety disorders, addiction, and arguably also in consumption decisions. <br/><br/>The relative contributions of present information and prior experience are assessed in an experiment that is firmly rooted in the economic theory of rational inattention as well as computational models of reinforcement learning from cognitive neuroscience. The experiment combines observed choice behavior with a measurement of neural activity, in order to establish whether the latter is correlated with probabilistic beliefs. The rationale is that dopaminergic activity in the midbrain is ? consistent with reinforcement learning theory ? believed to encode a reward prediction error, which can be observed in the striatum using functional magnetic resonance imaging. If this neural measurement can be validated as a proxy for probabilistic beliefs, it could be leveraged for inference on unobservable beliefs. This provides further evidence on the extent to which subjects? decisions rely on present information and prior experience, depending on the characteristics of these two sources of information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and sensors are critical to this technology, leading to a demand in developing sensors that are more efficient and less expensive. This award creates a new Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site focused on applications of ML methods for sensor and mobile IoT. Each summer, ten high school teachers and two community college instructors will participate in research activities at Arizona State University. High school teachers will be recruited from the Queen Creek Unified School District (QCUSD) and Salt River Schools (SRS), and community college instructors will be recruited from Cochise College (CC), all of whom serve a large population of underrepresented students. After a hands-on bootcamp centered on key concepts in ML, sensors, and IoT, teachers will be immersed in a 6-week research program and mentored by a team of ASU faculty, graduate student advisors, and industry leaders. ASU will continue their engagement with teachers throughout the school years and offer assistance and feedback on transferring their research experiences into the classroom. The goal of this RET Site is to give teachers a deeper understanding of ML and IoT such that they can develop engaging materials around these topics for their classrooms. Moreover, teachers? experiences will motivate and energize their students to engage in STEM activities and career pathways.<br/><br/>Industry labs strive to produce inexpensive sensors for mobile IoT whose performance hinges on signal conditioning and classification software. Training faculty and teachers in this area requires an integrative approach as software designers need to understand application/sensor limitations. RET Site participants will be immersed in application-driven algorithm and software development for sensor and IoT testbeds. In addition, the RET will require a short hands-on bootcamp in machine learning designed to build their knowledge in ML, sensors, IoT with the focus on developing materials for their classes. Industrial mentors and curriculum specialists will be engaged to provide reviews of research and instructional plans. The RET site objectives are to: a) introduce teachers and instructors to research practices by immersing them in government/industry research activities, b) engage them in the development of machine learning and signal processing methods for sensor and IoT health monitoring research, c) motivate and guide teachers to adapt RET experiences into compelling teaching materials. This RET features multidisciplinary synergies with access to unique technology, exceptional talents, and increased opportunities to broaden participation. RET Site partners, QCUSD, SRS and CC, serve a large number of minority students. In fact, the SRS serve 100% Native American students. The RET will disseminate publications and outcomes to conferences and teaching standard organizations. Teachers will create hand-outs and presentations to support their instructional plans.

A recent example of urbanization is in the Galapagos Islands, which is home to the iconic Darwin?s finches. The Galapagos currently hosts 225,000 tourists each year and is home to over 21,300 permanent residents. Consequently, humans have altered the natural habitat and introduced parasites to the Galapagos, such as a parasitic nest fly (Philornis downsi), which causes significant mortality to baby finches. However, recent work shows that small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa; a species of Darwin?s finch) in urban areas are healthier and less affected by the parasite compared to finches in non-urban areas, which suggests that birds are better defended against the parasite in urban areas. The goal of the research is to determine why Darwin?s finches in urban areas are less affected by the parasitic nest fly than finches in non-urban areas. The research will first explore what specific immune responses are being produced by the urban finches to lower their parasite burden. The work will then determine whether these heightened immune responses are driven by: 1) the environment, such as through urban food supplementation that could increase allocated energy to immunity, or 2) heritable genetic changes to the immune system within the urban population. Overall, the research seeks to understand bird-parasite interactions in response to urbanization by identifying the potential environmental or evolutionary basis of immunity to a novel parasite in a novel environment. The proposed work will also include broader impacts from a local to international scale through the development of in-class K-12 activities, public presentations, and online videos related to the research.<br/><br/>The research will use a series of experimental field studies to determine the immunological changes potentially occurring in Darwin?s finches in response to urbanization and whether  these changes are driven by environmental conditions or adaptive evolution. First, the work will determine what mechanisms of immunity differ between urban and non-urban finches by experimentally manipulating the parasite and characterizing gene expression of candidate immune genes in the finches across locations. Second, the research will determine whether environmental factors, such as increased food availability, in the urban area are driving differences in finch immunity by experimentally supplementing urban and non-urban finches with human-based food, then determining finch immunity and parasite burden. Lastly, the research will determine whether urban finches have adaptively evolved immunity to the parasite using a common garden experiment, whereby urban and non-urban finch young will be cross fostered in their original or new area, then their immunity and parasite burden will be quantified. The Galapagos system is powerful to address fundamental questions in urban eco-evolution because of the significant amount of established groundwork, the ability to perform  experiments in the field, and the relatively recent urbanization of the islands.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Evolutionary Processes cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Symbiosis, Defense and Self-recognition Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Redundant deliberation is a unique psychological process within decision-making under uncertainty, that has received less theoretical attention because it pertains to the absence, or delay, or a decision being made. To date a wealth or naturalistic research (i.e., research in the field) has observed the presence of redundant deliberation in emergency service responses, and real-life cases of decision-making under pressure have shown the presence, and indeed damage, of redundant deliberation (e.g., Grenfell Fire, intervention in the Syrian civil war).  Despite this, no scientific research has been able to explore the psychological process that underpins the causes of, and individual differences in redundant deliberation. <br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a new measure of decision-making in high-stakes, high-uncertainty situations that is designed for members of the emergency services and police force in order to develop scientific theory on the underlying psychological process of redundant deliberation. The main feature of this proposal is the validation and implementation of a newly designed research methodology; the Least-Worst Uncertain Choice Inventory for Emergency Responses. To date, this Inventory has been piloted on over 350 practitioners including members of the United States Armed Forces, members of the United Kingdom Police Force, senior members of the Singapore Crises Response team, and even members of the High Value Detainee Interrogation group. The results of these studies have shown that the Inventory can be used to explore the effect of individual differences (such as need for closure, self-reported maximization, goal orientation) on decision-making tendencies and redundant deliberation; that it can be used to model the neurological processes of redundant deliberation and that it can even be used to test emerging theories of redundant deliberation (e.g., the ?theory of colliding sacred values?). Thus, by furthering our understanding of the psychological process of redundant deliberation through the continued and expanded use of the Least-Worst Uncertain Choice Inventory for Emergency Responses, this CAREER grant can have a significant positive impact on the ability of people to respond to time-critical situations and avoid delaying important actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports participation in GLaMP 2020 to be held June 24-26, 2020 at Oberlin College and GLaMP 2021 to be held June 25-27, 2021 (dates tentative) at Michigan State University. Mathematical physics is one of the oldest scientific disciplines and is very active worldwide, with researchers working in both mathematics and physics departments. Although there are many mathematical physicists working in the United States, there are few regular conferences representing the field in this country. The GLaMP conferences meet the need for a regular annual meeting in mathematical physics in the US, specifically in the greater Midwest. The main goals of the meetings are: (1) to provide a forum for young researchers in mathematical physics in the US to present their research, as well as to foster their professional development; (2) to maintain communication and collaboration among scientists working in the field of mathematical physics throughout the United States; (3) to encourage participation by women and under-represented groups in the field of mathematical physics; and (4) to raise the research profile of mathematical physics within the mathematical and scientific community of the United States. Besides its location, the distinguishing feature of the GLaMP meeting is its emphasis on promoting and showcasing the scientific work of young researchers (graduate and advanced undergraduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty) in the field. <br/><br/>The GLaMP 2020 and 2021 conferences each consist of a three-lecture mini-course (one lecture each day) on a topic of current high-profile interest, five invited 50-minute plenary talks from leading researchers in their respective fields, and sessions of short 20-minute contributed talks given primarily by young researchers. To increase the visibility and participation by women and under-represented groups in mathematics, the organizers strive to have at least half of the invited plenary talks (including the mini course) be given by researchers from these under-represented groups. As in the past, the organizers will hold the meetings in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). To further highlight the focus of the meeting on the support of young researchers in their professional development, each GLaMP conference features a roundtable discussion on early-career development. The panel of the round table consists of researchers representing both careers in different types of academic institutions (for instance, private and public research universities, four-year liberal arts colleges), as well as in industry. <br/><br/>Details about the meetings will be posted on the conference websites: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2020 (for GLaMP 2020) and https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2021 (for GLaMP 2021).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, hop growing is one agricultural industry that confounds this model. Hops are an herb used in beer-making applications and many of the large Yakima Valley hop growers have invested both in local breeding programs and on-farm infrastructure innovations. The goal of this project is to understand the conditions under which some farmers research and develop their own agricultural technologies while others rely on outside research and to examine the innovations yielded by these diverging approaches to agricultural technologies. Hop farming in the United States offers a natural experiment to understand these differences. This project collects data from hop farmers through on-farm visits and in-depth interviews with farm owners and operators to better understand the social and applied scientific worlds of hop growing in the Northwestern and Midwestern United States. Doing so has the potential to help enhance understanding of how including farmers as research contributors may yield a more vibrant and sustainable agricultural and environmental future for farming in the United States.<br/><br/>Drawing on qualitative data collected through on-site interviews and on-farm participant observation, this project responds to two core research questions: (1) How do environmental and market pressures impact decisions about technologies used on the hop farm? (2) What comparative lessons do hop producers have for environmental and technical considerations in other agri-food regimes? Responding to these questions in the context of hop farmers? novel agricultural practices yields insights into broad societal concerns about labor, culture, and environment at the human-technology frontier. This is especially evident when studying agricultural practices where genetic and mechanical technological innovation has widely been employed to the detriment of farmer profits and the social health of farming communities. The unique position of hop farmers as on-farm innovators yields insights for alternative futures for agricultural technologies in cognate industries. This project contributes to research discourses in both STS and environmental sociology by critically considering where expert agricultural scientific knowledge is produced and maintained, and by questioning who may be considered an expert in agricultural science, particularly plant science. The implications of these queries are important for science-based policy in agricultural and environmental sectors if such policies are to be both inclusive as well as evidence-based. This original research provides novel insights into potential environmental alternatives to conventional models for other agricultures of scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuromorphic chips mimicking biological neurons and synapses execute machine learning algorithms in an energy-efficient manner. However, current neuromorphic architectures are inherently unreliable. They introduce errors during execution, limiting the dependability of machine learning. This project will address dependability challenges of neuromorphic computing, by looking at all levels, from building error-resilient machine learning algorithms to designing fault-tolerant hardware. This project will advance the field by 1) making neuromorphic computing reliable, efficient, programmable, and easy-to-use for the community, 2) teaching future science and engineering students how to make machine learning algorithms error-resilient, 3) creating job opportunities through national and international internships and collaborations, 4) raising interest of high school students in STEM through neuromorphic computing-enabled robotics workshops, and 5) building an integrated neuromorphic community through a new focused conference on neuromorphic computing. The research activities will be tightly integrated into teaching. Throughout this project, robot workshops will be organized annually for Drexel's Eureka (STEM for girls) and Philadelphia's high school students, jointly with the City of Philadelphia, to raise this community's interest in STEM. The project will also recruit undergraduate and graduate students in research and outreach activities, with emphasis on female and minority students.<br/><br/>This project addresses broad research questions with far-reaching implications in dependable neuromorphic computing: What are the reliability issues in neuromorphic architectures and how to model them? How do these reliability issues manifest as errors and impact the performance of machine learning algorithms? How to improve error tolerance in these algorithms by exploiting error resilience and self-repair properties in the brain, and how to proactively mitigate reliability issues in neuromorphic architectures to avoid errors in the first place? This project seeks to answer these research questions through the following three key research activities: 1) embedding biological self-repair properties in machine learning algorithms; 2) designing fault-tolerant hardware to implement these algorithms; and 3) proactively mitigating reliability issues and facilitating fault tolerance in hardware through algorithm/architecture co-design and design/technology co-optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal, the project will create a Technical Certificate in Integrated Design. This certificate will stack into several two-year degrees, including Associate of Applied Science degrees in Construction Technology and in Computer-aided Design. Curricula and educational resources for an Integrated Design Lab will be developed to support the certificate. This lab will provide students with an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning environment in which they can learn and practice design thinking. Design thinking activities will also be integrated into workforce-directed programs such as CAD, construction, 2D/3D design, and arts.  These additions will help students develop the design-related skills that are in high demand in engineering, graphic design, and fine arts.  The project aims to serve a diverse student population that includes incumbent workers and high school students, including those from groups that are traditionally under-served. In this way, the project aims to help meet the need for a diverse and creative STEM national workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop pathways for high school students, college students, and incumbent workers to learn design thinking as part of their STEM education. The project has three objectives. First, the project seeks to create a market-driven and competency-based curriculum in design thinking. Second, it will provide an interdisciplinary and experiential learning environment focused on design thinking and make the environment available to students and the community. Third, the project will establish Northwest Arkansas Community College as a technical and logistical hub for regional coordination, planning, and workforce training and produce certified students to fill workforce needs in local industry. Students in the program will develop Professional Portfolios to help them get jobs and develop careers.  A portion of the curriculum will be designed for the incumbent workforce, as well as for portability and transferabilty. Articulation agreements will extend post-secondary partnerships with regional four-year programs in industrial automation and design. Specialized equipment will support hands-on fabrication and production of functional products. The project builds upon previous NSF-funded work that explored the inclusion of design thinking and fabrication resources in the formation of design skills in baccalaureate engineering and graduate programs.  This project will extend that research with the inclusion of interdisciplinary elements utilizing design aesthetic and workforce-ready fabrication skills in associate degree programs. The project will additionally benefit the community through specialized workforce training and workshops for a general audience.

These deposits are of great importance for engineering applications such as mineral extraction and oil and gas exploration, and for understanding the processes that have governed the oceans throughout Earth's history. However, the formation and structure of these large salt deposits are at present poorly understood. Today, the Dead Sea is the only deep lake in the world in which salt crystals form and create a growing deposit on the seafloor.  This dynamic environment provides a unique natural laboratory for exploring the multiphase transport processes with phase change that create such salt deposits. This project will undertake a comprehensive investigation that combines an extensive field campaign by the Geological Survey of Israel with detailed large-scale computer simulations and theoretical analysis at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The research will train US engineering and geology students in the interdisciplinary areas of environmental model development, computational multiphase fluid dynamics, and large-scale simulations on parallel computer architectures. Student exchanges will take place between UCSB and the Dead Sea Observatory, and the investigators will hold lecture series at both institutions. An international workshop on the physical transport processes governing the Dead Sea is planned. <br/><br/>This project will explore and quantify the nonlinear interplay of the convective and diffusive transport of heat and salt.  The project will explore how this transport is modulated by (1) phase change between dissolved and crystalline salt within the lake; (2) radiative heating/cooling, evaporation/salt rejection and wind stresses at the lake's surface; and (3) inflow of freshwater, sediment and/or brine. The governing dimensionless parameters will be identified, along with the quantitative ranges that apply to the Dead Sea, and the respective balances that govern the dynamics. In this way, the project will obtain quantitatively accurate scaling laws for these processes, and enable predictions for the evolution of the Dead Sea under a variety of different environmental forcings.  Results will provide a predictive tool for managing water resources and useful information for advancing technologies related to mining and hydrocarbon exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding when the oceans first became oxygenated, and how oxygen levels have varied through time, is important to understanding the history of our planet. Chemical clues in marine sediments can be useful in deciphering past conditions. Tools that are currently being investigated as indicators of past oxygen levels include changes in the isotope content of certain trace elements, including thallium, molybdenum, uranium, and zinc. Before these tools can reliably be applied to past sediments, it is important that we understand how these elements are cycled in the present-day ocean, and how they are incorporated into sediments. While most work to date has looked at how these elements and isotopes are incorporated into oxygen-poor sediments, this study would measure these isotopes in a collection of oxygen-rich sediments that spans the world?s oceans. This study would provide essential bounds on marine isotope cycles to better understand modern ocean chemistry and, ultimately, how life and ocean geochemistry co-evolved over Earth history. This study would contribute to the professional development and training of three early-career scientists, and foster international collaboration. This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the modern day cycling of thallium (Tl), molybdenum (Mo), uranium (U) and zinc (Zn) isotopes in the ocean and improve interpretations of paleoceanographic proxies by constraining the oxic deep-sea sediment sink. This goal will be achieved by analyzing the Tl, Mo, U and Zn isotope compositions of the hydrogenous component in a newly assembled set of 73 marine sediment core top samples collected across every ocean basin. The authigenic component of the sediments will be isolated using partial dissolution techniques aimed at only dissolving authigenic minerals. The robustness of these methods will be thoroughly tested using bulk sediment mineral assemblages (obtained by XRD) as well as major and trace element compositions of bulk and partially dissolved samples. The generated dataset will enable an evaluation of the marine oxic output flux magnitude (constrained with 230Th) and stable isotope fractionation for Tl, Mo, U and Zn. A pilot study suggests that the isotope fractionation of these elements is different between Fe-oxides and Mn-oxides within the sediment, which are also unique from ferromanganese crusts and nodules. By expanding the pilot study to a global scale, we will be able to evaluate how previously published records of Tl, Mo, U and Zn isotopes in seawater may need to be reinterpreted due to diverse isotope fractionation patterns in the oxic marine sink.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The clothing industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, producing 1.2 billion tons of carbon emissions per year, with a truckload of clothing discarded globally every second. Diverting high volume cotton textile waste is a promising route to minimize pollution and energy and water-intensive production of new clothing. Green chemistry strategies to breakdown natural fabric waste into feedstocks for reconstituted fibers has tremendous potential to move towards zero waste economies based on cradle to cradle design strategies. About one third of the cotton muslin used at educational fashion institutions (e.g. FIT) in the fashion design sewing, draping and pattern making classes, goes to waste. The cotton muslin used in the classrooms is undyed and unbleached, making it an excellent resource for developing green methods to breakdown natural fibers to cellulosic feedstock. This project seeks to elucidate the chemistry and surface science crucial for optimizing an environmentally-benign degradation process to reconstitute muslin waste to produce precursor materials for textiles. <br/><br/>The research objectives of the work include: 1) Optimization of an environmentally-benign method for the regeneration of cellulosic feedstock from cotton waste. 2) Macro to nanoscale characterization of degradation/regeneration mechanisms to identify new opportunities for reduction of the textile waste stream. This project is a collaborative opportunity for student-driven realization of circular economy and sustainability leadership at the intersection of science and design. It also provides a conduit for project-based STEM education as a tool to address pressing global challenge. Successful outcomes of the project will provide a method for cotton muslin waste green chemistry degradation procedures. Investigation of environmentally-benign wet chemistry routes to muslin breakdown will be coupled with a suite of chemical analysis tools, including spectroscopy and microscopy, to understand the interaction between process chemistry and cotton molecular structure. The research will focus on expanding the utility of the chemical approach beyond muslin waste to cellulosic textiles and dyed fabrics in general. This work could highly impact the development of accessible models for circular economy materials and offers a conduit for ecological design and systems thinking in a STEM framework. Non- traditional science students from FIT (especially women and minorities) will perform research activities at Stony Brook University through the Institute for STEM Education (I-STEM), the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (URECA), Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs, and the Center for Inclusive Education (CIE) as well as at FIT.

Other applications arise in determining interior properties of materials from boundary measurements, as well as in electrical impedance tomography and other types of medical imaging. The surprisingly natural combinatorial structures associated with the underlying topological spaces allow one to find unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated areas.

The topology of this space has been recently determined; however, the topology of several related spaces remains not fully understood. For example, the physics of scattering amplitudes is intimately related to the amplituhedron, which is a linear projection of the positive Grassmannian. One of the projects involves understanding its topological structure and the combinatorics of its triangulations. Another example is the space of planar Ising networks, which was shown to coincide with the positive orthogonal Grassmannian. This approach has promising applications to the questions of universality and conformal invariance of the Ising model. The resulting cell decomposition of the space of planar Ising networks suggests a surprising direct connection with the space of planar electrical networks. The underlying algebraic structure of such spaces is described by cluster algebras; one of the projects involves studying integrability properties of dynamical systems arising from cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The question of how to correlate molecular structures to material properties has been central to the chemical sciences. Computer modeling has been invaluable to help answer this fundamental question, but it is still very difficult to predict the properties of larger structures. Current simulation methods often reach their limitations, since they are not able to emulate large systems for long enough times. Dr. Li is now taking advantage of the immense data from molecular simulations previously completed. She is inventing an efficient approach to automatically learn from existing data to build new molecular models. These models are able to decrease the difficulty of simulating the large amount of underlying molecular components. By connecting these models to predictions of material properties (like stability, shape, and size), Dr. Li is using simulation methods to screen natural and man-made polymers for desirable properties and to accelerate the discovery of new materials. The materials designed in this project will be biocompatible, bioactive nanomaterials for numerous applications in sensing, drug delivery, tissue engineering, etc.  The project also provides educational opportunities for students at multiple stages of their career development, by training graduate students with an interdisciplinary focus, as well as by encouraging undergraduate students early on to experiment independently with molecular modeling.   The educational activities will broaden STEM participation by providing new learning and research opportunities to undergraduate students.  Travel awards will be established to encourage underrepresented students in Vermont to attend the Green Mountain Winter Camp alongside their mentors and peers. <br/><br/>For future technological advances in soft materials (e.g. to create new programmable, biocompatible nanostructures formed by peptides, DNAs, and organic polymers) it is critical to understand complex self-assembly processes and to be able to accurately predict the resulting structures. Hierarchical modeling represents an invaluable tool to understand such processes, since it can examine and predict (often in greater detail than experiments) how self-assembly occurs at the relevant atomic, nanoscopic, and mesoscopic scales. However, to invent more powerful hierarchical computational methods for the future, universal highly coarse-grained (HCG) force fields in conjugation with effective backmapping methods are needed. To target these challenges, Dr. Li is creating a systematic, data-driven hierarchical (STAIR) methodology for multiscale modeling. STAIR is designed to overcome major drawbacks of currently available methods for systematic coarse graining, which still require substantial human expertise and labor for force field development. Specifically, STAIR replaces expensive fitting processes by innovative neural network algorithms and reduce human efforts in tasks like particle type determination, ad hoc corrections, etc. With the long-term goal to guide the rational design of complex nanomaterials from relatively simple building blocks, the overall objective is to invent hierarchical, adaptive modeling methods to guide the development of peptide- and DNA-based self-assembled nanomaterials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human social disorders, such as autism, also appear linked to altered gut microbiota, suggesting that gut microbes can have effects on social behavior in highly social animals. How exactly gut microbes affect host behavior, and what role the gut microbiome plays in social interactions remains unclear. Previous research on the microbiome and behavior has been performed on non-social model organisms, like mice and fruit flies, which do not form large, complex societies. Besides humans, complex social behaviors have also been observed in social insects; therefore, the proposed research will focus on the gut microbiome and behavior in European honey bees. The project will specifically investigate how modifications to gut microbiome can influence individual honey bee learning and their social interactions. This research will shed light on the evolution of complex interactions between gut microbes and their hosts, and will identify possible mechanisms by which gut microbes impact host behavior. In light of the worldwide honey bee decline, the research is potentially of applied agricultural importance, because the gut microbiome could be used to improve overall honey bee health. This research will promote research training for undergraduate students, with opportunities for veterans and other groups underrepresented in scientific research. Researchers will also work with local schools to create teaching modules based on the proposed project. <br/><br/>The gut microbiome has recently been shown to strongly affect host behavior, neurogenomic state, nutrition, and overall health in model organisms. The research tests the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiome have strong and measurable effects on individual- and group-level behaviors in honey bees. Honey bees have a number of features that make them ideal to study host-microbiome interactions, including: their well-characterized gut microbiome; a relatively simple gut microbiome in comparison to solitary model species; and the fact that honey bees have emerged as a model for studying the molecular and physiological underpinnings of highly social behavior. A well-established classical conditioning procedure, the proboscis extension reflex, will be used to quantify the effect of a gut microbe treatment on individual learning and memory, while any changes in social behaviors will be evaluated by constructing the interaction contact networks. Finally, RNA sequencing will be used to develop specific gene expression profiles from the host brain and gut tissues. The combination of these three approaches will link genetic and cellular changes induced by changes in the gut microbiome on honey bee individual and social behaviors, further building on the understanding of intricate interactions between hosts and their microbiomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal focuses on fundamental research on scalable distributed optimization. Several combined machine learning and mathematical models and methods are proposed to create highly scalable, fast, and efficient four-dimensional distributed optimization algorithms for power systems operation and planning.

Machine learning-based strategies will be developed to optimally decompose optimization problems. In addition, learning and mathematical approaches will be devised to create highly efficient and scalable asynchronous distributed algorithms. To further reduce computational costs, iterative methods are proposed to reduce the feasible space of optimization problems taking advantage of classification and regression techniques. Furthermore, the project team will develop methods to make distributed algorithms robust against the choice of initial values of optimization variables and objective functions and will devise innovative information-sharing approaches to reduce the computational complexity and enhance the accuracy of the proposed algorithms when integrated into power system operation and planning.

The long-term goal of this project is to create multifunctional nanostructures that possess tunable properties and are responsive to external stimuli. To achieve this final goal, this project is divided into three objectives. The First Objective will focus on tuning intra- and inter-molecular forces to modify properties at the supramolecular level.  This will permit the control of the morphology and physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials. The Second Objective will focus on developing theoretical tools (based in statistical mechanics) that can be used to predict supramolecular shape from the self-assembling molecules. This new software will be used to design novel nanostructures. The Third Objective seeks to prepare stimuli responsive nanomaterials. <br/>This will lead to nanostructures that can release selected molecules on demand and at various rates by the action of reactive oxygen species. This research will generate new biomaterials that are composed of diverse chemical functionalities with distinct pKas, hydrogen bonding potential, size, spatial orientation, and stereochemistry. It is expected these new biomaterials can lead to smart nanostructures that can adjust their behavior based on pH, salt concentration, temperature etc. The ability to design and tune material properties and molecular release with the aid of theoretical models and by the simple exchange of building blocks can lead to breakthroughs in material science, engineering, and medicine. In addition, this research will support educational activities geared towards high school, undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of science disciplines as well as the general public to increase nanotechnology literacy. Key concepts in self-assembly and nanotechnology will be disseminated by two primary teaching activities: (1) editing and expanding relevant Wikipedia entries, and (2) the creation of educational videos.

Students will use wearable technologies to capture their everyday experiences related to science and reflect on these experiences through a web-based interface. A dashboard application will support teachers in tailoring their classroom science lesson plans accordingly. The project will contribute to our understanding of how to design wearable technologies for connecting learning across contexts and will inform a framework of teaching science that is better grounded in students? everyday experiences with science concepts.

Outcomes of the project will lead to the design of new structures for connected science learning that are responsive to diverse student experiences and backgrounds.<br/><br/>In investigating connected learning across both everyday experience and formal school contexts, the project consists of a 4-phase work plan over five years.

Phase 2 will conduct iterative participatory design sessions with pre- and in-service teachers to investigate how to support them in incorporating students? everyday science reflections into school instruction through interactive dashboards. Phase 3 will develop an exemplar system that integrates the designed wearable with the teacher dashboard. Two evaluation studies will be conducted with two partner schools: the first study will address a single science concept, and the second study will be longer-term, allowing teachers to have free-use of the system for any number of science concepts over a semester. Phase 4 will identify guidelines for connected learning technologies and determine the extent to which these guidelines may generalize to other education levels (e.g., STEM college sophomores).

Traditional machine learning methods work by first collecting data and then training a fixed model for future predictions. However, much more challenging scenarios emerge as machine learning is deployed in more sophisticated applications, especially those that interact with human or other agents, such as recommender systems, game playing agents, self-driving cars, and many more. One main challenge in these applications is that the learning agent often has limited feedback from the surrounding environment, and it is thus critical to learn effectively with such limited feedback. Most existing approaches are conservative and assume worst-case environments. This project focuses on understanding how to exploit specific structures exhibited in particular problem instances, with the goal of developing more adaptive and efficient learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. The success of this project requires developing new algorithmic techniques and mathematical tools in a variety of disciplines. Education is integrated into this project through curriculum development, student mentoring, organizing workshops, and developing a partnership with the Montebello Unified School District to support the goal of building Computer Science pathways. <br/><br/>The project consists of three main directions: partial monitoring, bandit optimization, and reinforcement learning. Each direction generalizes the classic multi-armed bandit problem in a different dimension: partial monitoring generalizes the feedback model; bandit optimization generalizes the decision space and objective functions; and reinforcement learning generalizes from stateless to stateful models. Each direction contains several main objectives: (1) for partial monitoring, the focus is on understanding how to adapt to data, environments, and models; (2) for bandit optimization, the focus is on developing adaptive algorithms for learning with linear, convex, and non-convex functions respectively; (3) for reinforcement learning, the focus is on investigating under what conditions learning becomes easier, and how to learn under non-stationary or even adversarial environments.

This project explores improving efficiency of data collection by using AI to automatically direct data gathering efforts towards the most useful regions of the space. This is a big challenge; although AI systems can easily analyze large amounts of data in real-time, they lack an inherent understanding of the scientific domain (including objectives, background knowledge, and experience). On the other hand, human scientists and data collectors understand the domain but lack the ability to quickly process vast amounts of data. This project will develop principles and systems for real-time direction of scientific data collection with humans and AI systems working together, leveraging each other's strengths. The project will further our understanding of human-AI collaboration, resulting in new data collection algorithms and interaction paradigms that will help promote the progress of many scientific domains.

Socioeconomic inequalities are increasing in US families, leading to higher pressure on lower-SES families to find ways to make ends meet. As a result, parents and adult family members greatly rely on their children to take care of family responsibilities and critical needs. For some youth, high priority family responsibilities are a part of growing up, such as acting as a caretaker for younger siblings and being a language translator for English-language learning parents. Because of lower-SES family high reliance on this ""youth invisible work,"" young people are facing challenges in reducing their own stress, anxiety, sleeplessness, and depression. The overarching research questions guiding this project are: (1) What kinds of invisible work do youth perform with ICTs to solve family information problems around health and finances? (2) What design patterns, techniques, and frameworks can be used to embody the socio-ecological supports, funds of knowledge, and family resilience needed to promote youths' invisible work? (3) How can design patterns for invisible work be instantiated into sociotechnical systems that meet the needs of multiple users and designers? <br/> <br/>The research will use a value-sensitive design framework to engage in empirical, conceptual, and technical investigations. Empirical investigations will examine two lines of inquiry for online collaborative search by lower-SES families around (1) health information, such as mental health resources, preventative care, chronic illness, and medical insurance access; and (2) financial information, including job access, online banking, taxes, and college financial aid. Conceptual investigations will utilize participatory design methods with families, youth, and community stakeholders to develop artifacts and models around collaborations involving family online search and brokering. Technical investigations will focus on technology probes in the home and field studies in community centers and libraries to evaluate higher-fidelity prototypes. This study will result in theory generation, design practices, design cases, teaching materials, and professional resources to support integration of youth invisible work into ICT research and design.

In this regime, multiple agents (e.g., processors or sensors) communicate their information locally with their neighbors to cooperatively optimize a global performance metric. This decentralized paradigm plays a key role in the network domains where communication with a centralized coordinator is either undesirable or impossible. This also allows for preserving the privacy of the agents. It is for these reasons that the design and performance analysis of decentralized optimization methods have attracted a growing attention in several application domains such as data science, wireless networks, and communication networks. This project is aimed at development of new models, mathematical tools, and computational algorithms to address emerging complex multi-agent systems. This complexity arises in emerging applications such as remote sensing, economic dispatch models with renewable energy, and efficiency estimation in transportation networks. This project has the potential to substantially reduce the gap between the theory and real-world practice of complex multi-agent networks. Moreover, collaborations with the industrial partner will facilitate effective knowledge transfer. This project is also aimed at increasing awareness and interest among high school students, educators, and college students through several fully integrated educational and outreach activities. These include enhancing professional development of teachers of Stillwater High School, engaging secondary students in after school activities, and promoting diversity through involvement of underrepresented undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal is to advance the computational models and algorithms for distributed constrained optimization in emerging complex multi-agent networks. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to apply the theory of variational inequalities and regularization in the field of distributed optimization to design new algorithms with provable performance guarantees that can address multi-agent networks with complex constraints. This complexity arises in several application domains such as wireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and machine learning, where the optimization model is complicated due to the presence of:  (1) uncertainty and nonlinearity in constraints; (2) an inner-level large-scale optimization problem; or (3) equilibrium constraints. The state-of-the-art approaches including weighted-averaging consensus, push-sum, and alternate direction multiplier methods work often under the premise that functional constraints are easy-to-project. These schemes rely significantly on Lagrangian duality theory and do not lend themselves to asynchronous protocols and communication delays. Accordingly, this research is expected to advance the area of distributed optimization over complex networks by: (i) Development of an enhanced mathematical modeling framework by utilizing the theory of variational inequalities; (ii) Design and analysis of new classes of iteratively regularized consensus-based algorithms with explicit performance bounds to address the modeling framework; and (iii) Explore novel ways to address nonsmoothness in the modeling framework. The long-term educational goal is to broaden the participation of K-12 and college students (in particular women and underrepresented minorities in STEM) in the fields of Operations Research and Applied Mathematics. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective of this CAREER project is to inspire and engage young minds, formal and informal educators, and undergraduate and graduate students in understanding the role of optimization in tomorrow?s practice.

The shape memory effect refers to the ability of a material to remember and recover a pre-programmed shape in response to a combination of magnetic and mechanical fields.  These materials are composites with embedded magnetic particles in shape memory polymer matrices. They utilize superposed alternating and direct magnetic fields to regulate the stiffness and shape changing actuation of the materials. They combine untethered fast and reversible transformation, shape-locking ability, and reprogrammability in one material system and have potential applications in soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices for minimum invasive surgery. However, the complicated magneto-thermo-viscoelastic behaviors of these materials make the design of applications using these materials very challenging. The success of this work will lead to a systematic understanding of the magnetic shape memory polymer, a material model to describe the magneto-thermo-viscoelastic behavior and a multiphysics simulation platform to accelerate the design of applications. This work will provide hands-on interactive multi-disciplinary research experience for middle and high school students through 3D Printed Magnetically Actuated Soft Robots. This work will also demonstrate material research to K-12 students and the general public through the local Science and Industry Science Festival and the Ohio State University STEAM factory Franklinton Friday Events. <br/><br/>Soft active materials are widely used but have limitations such as slow actuation speed, irreversible actuation, or no shape-locking. Magnetic shape memory polymers overcome these limitations by integrating rapid magnetic actuation with shape memory effects in polymers. These materials use the alternative current magnetic field to control the temperature and the direct current magnetic field to actuate the materials. The coupling of magnetic actuation with thermoviscoelastic material behavior demands intensive fundamental mechanics research. This CAREER award will provide new understandings on how the interactions among magnetic particles and magnetic particles-polymer matrix can alter the thermoviscoelastic and shape memory behavior of a polymer. These understandings will enable the establishment of a thermodynamic framework for magneto-thermo-viscoelastic solids. The new framework can provide a clear description of the complicated multiphysics processes and guide the development of a new constitutive model for magneto-thermo-viscoelastic solids. The new constitutive model will be implemented into finite element analysis to simulate the magnetic and thermal actuation of magnetic shape memory polymers with complicated geometry and complicated loading conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many current attempts to address this problem focus on reducing ?implicit? or ?unconscious? bias. At the same time, scientists are increasingly debating and critiquing implicit bias as a concept. While awareness of implicit biases has become commonplace, the associated science does not yet provide a solid foundation on which to build intervention efforts. The central goal of this project is to strengthen the scientific understanding of implicit bias by identifying differences in how people respond to groups and group labels, versus specific individuals and individual targets. It will reveal whether researchers and organizations wishing to address bias should be focusing on ?unconscious? bias, or whether more effective interventions could be designed by focusing on bias toward groups versus individuals. The project will help address popular misconceptions of implicit bias from our theoretical understanding of how bias operates. In addition, it will generate valuable insights for addressing bias in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This project involves 12 experiments that will tackle a key confound that obstructs the ability to draw strong conclusions about the research on implicit bias: the confound between type of measure (i.e., explicit vs. implicit) and stimuli type (i.e., categories vs. exemplars). Traditionally, research examining explicit bias typically requires participants to respond to abstract social categories (e.g., the categories Black people and White people), whereas implicit measures typically involve specific exemplars of those categories (e.g., faces of Black and White individuals). The current project uses computer-based reaction time tasks and behavioral measures to probe core themes regarding implicit-explicit relations. For example, do low correlations between common implicit and explicit measures of bias reflect (a) differences in processing awareness or do those low correlations derive from (b) the differences in stimuli type? Moreover, do category-focused evaluations and exemplar-focused evaluations have distinct consequences? By identifying the distinction between explicit and implicit measures on the one hand, and the distinction between categories and exemplars on the other, we can gain new insights into the causes and consequences of bias, with important implications for both theory, practice, and discrimination intervention programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coordinated cell behavior is a hallmark of both organism development and organism functioning. Collective cell migration is one example of such cellular coordination.  It plays a central role in embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer invasion.  Despite its importance, collective cell migration is poorly understood. Studying coordinated cell movement is challenging because the processes that regulate cellular machinery, the interaction of cells with each other, and their interaction with their local environment all affect each other.  The research community lacks tools that can grasp such complexity at the systems level. This work will overcome this challenge by integrating state-of-the-art imaging technologies with comprehensive simulation models of cellular dynamics that bridge different length and time scales. This will reveal how the complex interplay of cell responses defines the emergent collective behavior.  Beyond the research laboratory, the results of the work and enthusiasm for research will be broadcast widely through outreach efforts, launching the career of the Principal Investigator.  Specifically, the project will benefit the society by introducing project-related, inclusion-focused undergraduate and graduate courses and a STEM Diversity Internship for underrepresented students from Spelman College and K-12 teachers participating in the Georgia Tech GIFT Program.<br/> <br/>The specific goal of the project is to decipher complex cross-talk mechanisms between the environment-dependent cell signaling and the cytoskeletal machinery via the implementation of a novel, hybrid (agent-based/systems-dynamics) method.

To inform the models and validate their predictions, quantitative experimental characterization of individual and collective cell migration will be carried out using micro-patterned adhesive assays.  These assays provide well-controlled extracellular conditions and visualization of different modes of cell migration with high spatial and temporal resolution. This integrative approach will test the project?s central hypothesis that the bidirectional feedback between cell shape, localization of actin regulators, adhesion turnover, and arrangement of stress fibers, predictably determine the mode of migration a cell adopts, ultimately impacting the efficiency of the collective cell migration.

More precisely, the desire for general-use ?5G and beyond? radios require architectures with continuous operation across the whole millimeter-wave (mm-wave) spectrum up to the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands. However, a major barrier against achieving that goal is the associated signal loss that results from the large path loss and atmospheric absorption at those frequencies. High gain multi-antenna radios are a potential solution, but they require massive hardware, making them unsuitable for 5G devices. To reduce hardware requirements, research has been focused on implementing fully digital transceivers to replace most of the analog hardware with software operations. This hardware-to-software convergence is still limited to low frequencies and remains relatively expensive. This CAREER presents novel techniques to implement a universal radio architecture for operation across legacy, 5G, and future 6G bands using a single multifunctional and adaptable platform. This research will lead to improvement in terrestrial, airborne, satellite, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Also, mm-wave and sub-THz systems will enable assistive technology via miniature medical, wearable, and implantable devices. Therefore, this research will have significant societal benefits impacting daily life for all. The research proposed in this project will be integrated with the principal investigator?s educational plans to develop new courses for both undergraduate and graduate students with focus on 5G and mm-wave transceivers. Efforts will also be taken to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM via curriculum development, undergraduate research programs, and outreach efforts. A new STEM outreach program on hands-on activities on radio communications will be established that involves the children of formerly homeless population, predominantly Hispanics and African Americans, individuals with disabilities, substance use, and mental health disorders.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study, design, and develop wideband multifunctional adaptable transceivers for operation across the 5G, mm-wave, and sub-THz spectrum. To date, transceivers that can handle extremely wide operational bandwidths are not available. Indeed, current radios suffer from several bottlenecks: 1) antennas suffer from size-bandwidth-gain tradeoffs and are very lossy at high frequencies (i.e. mm-wave and sub-THz), 2) wideband radio frequency (RF) components are costly, lossy, and nonlinear, 3) high speed digitizers are power hungry and cost prohibitive, and 4) baseband digital electronics and software defined radios (SDR) are limited to narrowband and low frequency operations. This CAREER addresses these issues and brings forward innovative techniques to implement a universal radio with ?on demand? operation from a few hundred MHz to sub-THz frequencies using a single multifunctional and upgradable platform that combines 1) extremely wideband and reconfigurable aperture-in-aperture radiator, 2) high frequency modular and tunable RF front-ends that are inexpensive and power efficient operating from UHF (300MHz) up to sub-THz (300GHz) bands, and 4) physical layer interference suppression techniques. Importantly, the proposed radio is upgradable with evolving SDR technologies. That is, as SDR frequency coverage expands into emergent bands and becomes more affordable for commercial use, the RF hardware will be replaced with software operations. This hardware-to-software convergence will contribute in further reduction of the modular hardware whereby more RF modules will be integrated in the SDR. The long-term vision of this project is to implement an affordable and efficient fully digital system, with minimum hardware, operating from the low microwave frequencies up to the mm-wave bands. Overall, the proposed architecture will enable interference resiliency with increased spectral efficiency, spatial filtering, and concurrent beams across extremely large bandwidths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their importance in the natural cycling of carbon, the oceans have absorbed approximately 40% of the carbon dioxide that has been emitted by fossil fuel burning. Understanding the processes that cause spatial and temporal variations of ocean carbon and oxygen concentrations is critical to predicting how these ocean cycles will develop into the future. Recent measurement-based estimates and computer models agree that ocean carbon uptake increased significantly in the early 1990s and then slowed over the rest of the decade. Observations and models also indicate significant oxygen variations. One possible driver of these patterns that has not been explored is the influence of large volcanic eruptions, specifically Mount Pinatubo in 1991. With the eruption, small particles were forced to great altitude where they spread through the upper atmosphere, reflected sunlight back to space, and led to a temporary cooling of global climate. This project will explore how this temporary cooling influenced ocean circulation, and air-sea carbon and oxygen exchange, by comparing Earth system model simulations that do and do not include the effects of Mt. Pinatubo?s eruption. <br/><br/>Within the framework of NCAR?s Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) effort, the team will complete a new experiment that explicitly excludes forcing from Mt. Pinatubo (CESM-LE-NoVolc). By difference from the existing CESM-LE that includes all forcing, the investigators will directly identify the effects of Mt. Pinatubo and put these effects in context with observed carbon and oxygen change. Specifically, they propose to address two hypotheses: <br/>Hypothesis 1: Trends in surface fluxes and interior distributions of anthropogenic carbon and oxygen since the 1990s have been significantly impacted by Mt. Pinatubo.<br/>Hypothesis 2: After the initial uptake anomaly due to Mt. Pinatubo, thermocline anomalies that are cool and anomalously high in tracers return to the surface. These anomalies suppress air- to-sea fluxes for up to a decade after the eruption. <br/><br/>Recent work has also indicated that variability in the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide has a first-order effect on variability of ocean carbon uptake. The investigators will also do preliminary analysis using one new run of the CESM ocean-ice hindcast and a stratified analysis of CMIP6 models to further explore this issue. Specifically, they propose a third hypothesis: <br/>Hypothesis 3: By including the seasonal cycle and latitudinal distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide in simulations, variability of the globally integrated air-sea carbon flux is increased and becomes more comparable to observationally-based estimates. <br/><br/>By creating CESM-LE-NoVolc, this work will allow for investigation of the forced impact of Mt. Pinatubo on a wide range of ocean biogeochemical and physical processes. Model runs will be made easily available under the CESM-LE project umbrella. Under this research project, graduate and undergraduate research will be supported. The team will continue to our long-standing efforts to attract underrepresented students to science, and to explain ocean and carbon cycle science to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A technique called Raman spectroscopy reveals information about molecular structure using the light scattered by molecules as they vibrate at their unique frequencies. Over 40 years ago, it was discovered that the Raman scattering signals could be increased dramatically (more than a million times) when molecules were stuck to (adsorbed on) a roughened metal surface. That discovery improved chemical detection and analysis, however the signal improvements are not always reproducible from one surface to another and the precise reason for the enhancement is still under vigorous debate. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Xi Ling of Boston University is investigating signal enhancements in Raman spectroscopy on the surfaces of well-defined, two-dimensional (2D) crystals (e.g., tin sulfide (SnS2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2)). The structure and properties of these crystals are better defined and understood than those of roughened metal surfaces and thus, Professor Ling and her students may uncover how and why Raman signal are enhanced on surfaces.  New technologies are expected to emerge from this research project, especially in the field of chemical analysis, where it may become routine to detect just a few or even a single molecule of a substance. The students engaged in this project are gaining advanced training in spectroscopy (light-matter interactions) and molecular and materials design, both of which are increasingly sought-after areas of expertise in the science and technology sector.  Professor Ling will develop and implement a laser spectroscopy experience for students by collaborating with Boston University's Learning Resource Network (LERNet) and its outreach programs. This outreach program encourages young women and high schools students to enter science and engineering fields. Dr. Lin will also enhance open source education resources for high school teachers and students by developing interactive video lesson modules. <br/><br/>The mechanisms of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) are not fully understood, especially the chemical mechanism (CM), which remains relatively mysterious compared to the electromagnetic (EM) mechanism. The scientific objectives of this project are to gain a deeper understanding of chemical mechanism and explore the potential of 2D crystals to overcoming the key problem of reproducibility of SERS in practical applications. Quantitative SERS data from well-defined samples (both 2D substrate and adsorbed analytes) serve to test the CM theory in the literature. The Ling group is employing multiple analytical approaches, such as wavelength-scanned Raman measurements, micro-absorption spectroscopy, as well as rigorous group theory analysis to understand the origin of the chemical enhancement in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, toward the development of revolutionary SERS-sensing techniques, 2D crystal/metal systems are being investigated to understand how the 2D crystals influence the plasmon frequency and electromagnetic field distribution of metal nanostructures and demonstrate the high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility of the system in micro-sensing. Collectively, these investigations are providing a deeper understanding of the controversial CM in SERS and guide an innovative design of a better SERS platform. The broader technical impacts of this work include new knowledge of CM in SERS and the seeding of development of new technique for chemical and bio-sensing.

The model will be evaluated on its ability to induce morphological systems from large naturalistic data sets containing many rules and exceptions and to match human performance in generalizing morphological rules from small amounts of evidence in controlled experiments. By incorporating insights from linguistics and other areas of cognitive science, the model will provide a bridge between the studies of human and artificial intelligence.

Some VOCs that are produced in the ocean and then enter the atmosphere as gases have been seen to play an important role in climate. Since marine microbes both produce and consume these compounds they affect the concentration of VOCs in the surface ocean. The investigators found that as much as 20% of the carbon resulting from photosynthesis leaked out of microscopic plants in the form of VOCs. These molecules were then used by bacteria as a source of carbon and energy. This suggests that VOCs may play a more important role in the flow of carbon in the marine environment than previously thought. This project examines how microscopic plants and bacteria produce and consume different VOCs.  It supports professional development training workshops for Oregon high school teachers from rural areas in OSU?s Science & Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program. SMILE?s mission is to close the achievement gap for underserved students by increasing their STEM-content knowledge, preparing them to succeed in higher education, and inspiring them to pursue STEM careers. This project also contributes to three workshops per year, training teachers and engaging students with hands-on learning activities on the topic of Carbon Cycling by Marine Microorganisms such as ?Clouds in a Bottle?. One graduate student, one post-doctoral scholar, and at least six undergraduate researchers are being trained by participating in research activities. <br/><br/>Field observations suggest that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by phytoplankton are either rapidly consumed by bacterioplankton in the surface ocean or emitted into the atmosphere. VOCs are an understudied path for carbon transfer in microbial food webs throughout sunlit marine ecosystems because these compounds require specialized detection methods. Using a new system to study VOCs in suspensions of live plankton cells, 20% of photosynthetic carbon fixation was seen to be transferred as VOCs from a diatom to SAR11 bacterioplankton in co-cultures. Many of these transferred VOC compounds were not known to be growth substrates for bacterioplankton. Both the magnitude and complexity of the observed VOC transfer were surprising. This project extends these observations to a larger set of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton through controlled studies of cultures, co-cultures, and mesocosms. VOC are detected via proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and isotopic labeling is used to measure the impact of VOC exchange on rates of photosynthesis and bacterial production. VOC production by phytoplankton is measured in response to nutrient-driven variation in growth rates, and over day-night cycles to discern the relationship of VOC production to photosynthetic metabolism and other cellular processes. These experiments enable  a better understanding of field observations, in which bacterial consumption of VOCs can appear to significantly outpace production, while temporal variability in VOC production across daily to seasonal scales can cause VOCs to accumulate transiently to pM-nM concentrations in the surface ocean. This project contributes to close the significant gap in knowledge about the range and quantity of VOCs produced by phytoplankton, and about the roles played by these compounds in phytoplankton metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research involving simultaneous measurements of the two global circuits is decidedly global in nature. The two globally invariant (at any given time) quantities under study are (1) the ionospheric potential, representing the totality of electrified weather and (2) Schumann resonance activity, the global totality of lightning, both of which are experienced by all of humanity. Thunderstorms and lightning are both threats to all human activity, and so deserve to be monitored. The monitoring of the Earth?s Schumann resonances lends itself naturally to international cooperation.  Both global electrical circuits have been shown to be responsive to surface air temperature on a variety of time scales, with much relevance on longer time scales to fossil fuel consumption and global warming given these natural frameworks for global monitoring.  The observed trends will be of value to policy makers. The interest in the variable source strengths of continental ?chimneys? (continental scale regions of strong convection) is also directly linked to the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere, and hence global weather patterns are likely linked with the global circuit variations under investigation here. Thunderstorms are important players in global warming because they produce large areas of cirrus cloud that affect incoming solar radiation, and also redistribute water vapor from the planetary boundary layer to the upper troposphere where it is radiatively more important.  A critical aspect of global heat balance also lies with tropospheric aerosol and this study is the first to take on the monitoring of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on the spatial scale of the continental chimneys.<br/><br/>A large body of evidence, some of it a century old, supports the view that the ionospheric potential characterization of the DC (?Direct Current?) global electrical circuit is maximum over the diurnal cycle in Universal Time (UT) when the American continent is electrically predominant near 19-20 UT. In contrast, a comparable body of evidence shows that global lightning activity, and the AC (?Alternating Current?) global circuit (aka, Schumann resonances) is maximum when Africa is electrically predominant (14-15 UT). This apparent contradiction is referred to hereafter as the ?global circuits paradox?. This research is aimed at a resolution of this paradox.  The thesis of this investigation is that the ?global circuits paradox? has long gone unresolved because essential quantities have not been examined in comparisons of contributions from America and Africa, the dominant chimneys driving the global circuits. Thermodynamic contrasts have previously been examined and fall short in resolving the paradox. Electrified shower clouds were identified as possible fundamental sources additional to thunderstorms for the DC global circuit by C.T.R. Wilson, but careful comparisons between America and Africa are only recently possible with satellite and lightning observations. Increased pollution in the form of CCN have been shown to increase lightning flash rate in thunderstorms in both observations and models, but only recently have CCN been accessible on the continental scales relevant to the global circuits. In this study, coordinated measurements of the DC and AC global circuits when Africa and America are most prominent, together with electrified shower clouds and CCN (and with appropriate controls on thermodynamic quantities) to resolve the global circuits paradox.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies emphasized negative interactions (competition, predation) as structuring reef systems, but positive interactions in such species-rich systems could be of equal importance in maintaining ecosystem function. If foundation species like corals depend on positive interactions, then their fitness may decline with the loss of surrounding species, creating a biodiversity meltdown where loss of one coral causes losses of others. This project conducts manipulative field experiments to understand the role of coral biodiversity in facilitating coral growth, survival, resilience, and retention of these foundation species and the critical ecosystem services they provide in shallow tropical seas. This project is committed to: 1) Educating and exciting influential business and civic leaders about conservation and restoration of coastal marine systems before these systems lose ecological function and value. This will involve influential Rotary clubs within North Georgia/Atlanta (the major economic engine of the southeastern US) as an initial focus. 2) Using the Research News and Institute Communications Office at Georgia Tech and well-developed contacts with science writers to produce popular press pieces on important ocean ecology discoveries emerging from these studies. (3) Organizing a public workshop of internationally prominent scientists focused on Maintaining Marine Biodiversity as a Strategy to Sustain Ecosystem Services and Coastal Cultures and Economies. A previous effort like this, organized by the investigators, attracted about 200 attendees and was webcast to numerous high schools in Georgia and to foreign investigators in less developed countries that could not attend. Speakers also conducted in-person video interviews with local high school classes. Due to that success, this model will be repeated. 4) Working with an association of educators and cultural leaders in French Polynesia to produce electronic format presentations on our work and on reef conservation that are appropriate for use by both teachers and leaders within Polynesian culture.  <br/><br/>Ecologists have excelled at demonstrating the importance of direct (often negative) interactions among species pairs. However, when these interactions occur in a complex context among thousands of other species in the field, the sum of the many, poorly-known, indirect interactions can counterbalance, or even reverse, the better-known direct interactions, generating diffuse mutualisms instead of agonistic outcomes. In a proof-of-concept initial experiment, coral growth and survivorship were greater in coral polycultures than monocultures, especially during early stages of community development. Processes generating this outcome are unclear but understanding these is of critical importance as diversity and function of reefs decline and as humans need to predict and adapt to changing environments. This interdisciplinary investigation merges expertise in experimental field ecology, chemical ecology, and the ecology of microbiomes to investigate the functional role of biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems. Experiments use a novel coral transplantation method and field manipulations to assess: 1) whether greater coral species diversity enhances coral community performance, as well as growth and survivorship of individual corals, 2) whether greater genotypic diversity enhances coral performance within a species, 3) whether greater diversity of seaweed competitors further suppresses corals and enhances seaweed performance, and 4) the processes driving the patterns documented above, including the roles of disease, intraspecific versus interspecific competition, predators, mutualists, and differential access to, or use of, resources. The research investigates the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function across dimensions of coral taxonomic diversity, from species to genotypes, and creates a series of experiments elucidating general principles underlying ecosystem dynamics. Filling these knowledge gaps advances our fundamental understanding of how biodiversity influences ecosystem function at multiple scales and provides insight into the processes promoting coral coexistence in these species-rich ecosystems. Findings will have practical implications for coral management and restoration and may improve predictions regarding coral reef resilience and recovery in the face of changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project follows the supply chains and circulation of vehicles in two contexts, each which regulate imports differently, have varied inventories, supply chains, and regimes of maintenance and repair. Ethnographic methods of shadowing and interviewing will be used to examine the assemblages that keep vehicles on the road as well as the socio-material constraints to doing so, asking what factors (such as differences in regulatory and repair regimes, creativity and innovation in repair and maintenance) contribute to variability of market behavior and the economic viability of these secondary markets. This project approaches the question of value in an open-ended manner, by examining ongoing processes of valuation as they occur along supply chains and during moments of breakdown and repair.

Natural and industrial sources contribute to fluoride levels in the soil, water, and air.  While there is no biological requirement for fluoride, low concentrations of fluoride enhance teeth quality in animals.  However, under certain conditions, fluoride is toxic. Toxicity depends on multiple factors including concentration, exposure time, and the organism itself.  Fluoride-sensitive plants like Gladiolus are injured at a concentration of 20 ppm (1 mM), while concentrations above 1200 ppm (63 mM) have no observable effects on the fluoride-tolerant tea plant.  Protection against fluoride toxicity in single-celled organisms is achieved by removing fluoride ions from the cell through a membrane channel called FEX (Fluoride Exporter).  A gene encoding this fluoride channel has been recently identified in multicellular organisms, including plants.  Plants are particularly vulnerable to fluoride because they are exposed to fluoride from the soil, water, and air.  In addition, phosphate fertilizers used to enhance plant growth are sources of contaminating fluoride because they are produced from rock phosphate, which contains fluoride.  Studying the putative fluoride channel in plants will broaden our understanding of how they avoid fluoride toxicity.  This knowledge will help to protect crop plants from fluoride and possibly reduce the concentration of fluoride in specific plant tissues.  In cooperation with the Yale Pathways to Science program, middle- and high- school students will explore plant biology and the scientific method through an all-day festival, in-depth workshops, and extensive summer laboratory experiences.  <br/><br/>This research investigates how FEX contributes to fluoride tolerance in plants. Putative fluoride channels from several plants have been tested in a yeast FEX knockout and found to provide fluoride tolerance to a level similar to native yeast FEX.  In addition, deletion of FEX in Arabidopsis is lethal in normal plant growth conditions.  A variety of viability and growth assays will be used to assess the effect of altered levels of FEX in plants.  How FEX affects fluoride travels through plants will be monitored using 18F and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).  Additionally, the expression of FEX will be manipulated using cell-specific promoters to ascertain whether plants employ, or would benefit from, a coordinated higher-order strategy for fluoride regulation.  This work will establish how the plant accumulates and dissipates fluoride and the role of FEX in that process. Information will be obtained on how to improve fluoride detoxification using FEX.  It represents the first study of FEX and fluoride efflux in a multicellular organism.  These experiments will provide insights into the ability of FEX to direct fluoride to or from specific tissues through differential regulation, create a baseline for characterization of fluoride toxicity in plants, and open up new areas of study for fluoride detoxification and bioremediation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groundwater is also an indispensable resource for energy production, agricultural and industrial uses. A karst aquifer is a special type of aquifer that is formed in regions underlain by soluble rocks, typically carbonate rocks. Karst aquifers hold 40% of U.S. groundwater. The dissolution of soluble rocks through time creates a complex groundwater flow system in karst aquifers, which is typically characterized by a network of fractures and conduits that connect to the surface water through sinkholes, sinking streams, and springs.  Those characteristics make karst aquifers potentially vulnerable to both climate change and contamination. The proposed research seeks to enhance understanding of the complex network of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in order to advance the prediction of water flow, surface water and groundwater interaction, contaminant transport, nutrient cycle,  and the carbon cycle in many karst aquifers under increased stresses from human activities.  This project will also greatly benefit the economically distressed karst Appalachian region where students are underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This project is jointly funded by the Hydrologic Sciences (HS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This research will be centered on conducting collaborative research using a complementary data fusion approach. The approach fuses data collected from hydraulic tomography, river stage tomography, electrical resistivity tomography, and tracer tests to produce a more reliable map of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in a cost-effective manner. In turn, the results will lead to improved understanding and prediction of flow and solute transport in the karst aquifers.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate an innovative approach for characterizing karst aquifers in detail based on the data fusion concept. To achieve this goal, this research will design two new field surveys: surface and subsurface river stage tomography and electrical resistivity tomography with moving current sources. This research will also explore the feasibility of natural lightning tomography for large-scale resistivity surveys. The data collected from these surveys will be integrated into a geostatistical-based inversion framework to characterize the distribution and morphology of fractures and conduits with great detail. The fusion approach will be tested and validated at the Cane Run Royal Spring Basin in central Kentucky. The validity of the characterized karst aquifers will be evaluated using a separate model with the field-collected water level, water chemistry, tracer, and stable isotope data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.<br/><br/>Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little research has examined the interplay between unconscious and cognitive processes in relation to decision-making outcomes related to work. This project focuses on how individuals interpret and cognitively attend to information when evaluating job applicants? rsums that differ on race/ethnicity and work ability to better understand how individuals interpret such information.  Project findings will inform workplace and governmental policies and practices to modify and improve hiring strategies that address inequality in evaluations relevant to key aspects of the work process. <br/> <br/>Racial inequality at work is a partial function of both unconscious and cognitive mechanisms that are present in hiring recommendations. This project uses a mixed-methods experimental design that collects evaluations, physiological measurements and qualitative interviews. One hundred and eighty participants will review a pair of rsums that signal race/ethnicity and work ability, i.e. work skill score, a tool used by companies to diversify their hiring practices. Neurological and eye-tracking methods will be used to investigate implicit and cognitive attention during rsum evaluations and qualitative interviews will be used to observe how decisions are rationalized. A neurological approach captures evaluators? cognitive attention when evaluating different types of information, such as race/ethnicity and work skill scores.  Eye-tracking methods will triangulate what information is implicitly capturing evaluators? attention. Of the 180 participants, thirty randomly-selected evaluators will participate in qualitative interviews to help provide insight into the interpretive frameworks evaluators may use to justify unequal outcomes. The mixed-methods approach will demonstrate for social psychologists key strategies for studying racial inequality; for race and ethnicity scholars the project will demonstrate the power of experimentation in the laboratory.

Nitrite is a pivotal compound in the nitrogen cycle: it can be oxidized to nitrate, and thus retained as an available nutrient, or it can be reduced to dinitrogen gas, and thus lost from the bioavailable nitrogen pool. Oxidation of nitrite by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) is the only biological pathway by which nitrate is produced, and all known NOB require oxygen for life.  The reduction pathway is also carried out by microbes, in this case, bacteria that thrive only in the absence of oxygen.  In previous experiments, however, both oxidation and reduction of nitrite were detected in the same samples from ocean waters in the absence of oxygen. We will investigate three explanations for the apparent oxidation of nitrite in the absence of oxygen on a research cruise to the low oxygen waters off the coast of Peru:  1) The presence of unknown kinds of NOB that do not require oxygen; 2) a new reaction called dismutation, which is possible but never detected in nature; 3) an artifact associated with oxygen stress in NOB.  This research could lead to discovery of novel mechanisms and or novel organisms that determine the fate of nitrite and the availability of nitrogen to support primary production in the long run. This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning by providing opportunities for Princeton students to get involved in and have hands on experience in research in the lab and potentially at sea.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research through internships and field experiences. We will also integrate our work at sea into teaching in the classroom via videos and assignments based on data collected during the cruise.<br/><br/>Nitrite oxidation is the only known biological process that produces nitrate, which comprises the largest fixed nitrogen reservoir in the ocean. Nitrite oxidation is carried out by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and all known species are obligate aerobes. Nitrite reduction to N2 occurs in multiple microbial pathways, generally under anoxic conditions. Despite their apparent incompatibility regarding oxygen, both processes are detected in the low oxygen or anoxic waters of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs).  Thus, the fate of nitrite in OMZs has implications for the global fixed N budget. Nitrite oxidation is detected at high rates in essentially zero oxygen water in the most oxygen depleted depth intervals in OMZ regions, which suggests that some nitrite oxidizers might possess anaerobic metabolic capabilities.  Nitrite disproportionation (or dismutation), in which nitrite is simultaneously oxidized to nitrate and reduced to N2, is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, which would link the two processes in one organism ? but it has never been observed in nature.  The research proposed here will address two big questions about nitrite in the ocean: 1) How does anaerobic nitrite oxidation work?  2) What determines the fate of nitrite? The experimental approach will investigate three possible explanations for anaerobic nitrite oxidation:  1) Nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by different clades of NOB, which exhibit different tolerances/requirements for oxygen; 2) Nitrite dismutation, also performed by NOB, partially explains the cooccurrence of oxidation and reduction of nitrite; 3) Apparently anaerobic nitrite oxidation is indeed biologically mediated but does not always represent net production of nitrate from nitrite; rather it results from isotopic equilibration during enzyme-catalyzed interconversion of nitrite and nitrate.  These questions will be addressed by performing a suite of 15N-tracer incubations at stations located within and outside of one of the major OMZs in the ocean, the Eastern Tropical South Pacific. The dependence of the rate processes on oxygen concentrations will be determined, and the composition of the microbial assemblages will be assessed in order to determine whether different microbial components are involved under different environmental conditions. The expression of genes involved in oxidation/reduction/ respiratory metabolisms at low oxygen concentrations will be measured across oxygen gradients and in oxygen manipulations to identify their potential role in supporting ?anaerobic? nitrite oxidation. The possibility that the apparently anaerobic nitrite oxidation is due to an enzyme level interconversion between nitrite and nitrate, which does not lead to net nitrate production and is not linked to growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria, will also be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Theories abound explaining which traits are suspected to be the most desirable, yet limited research explores the consequences of constrained decision-making on whom one selects as a reproductive partner. This is despite the fact that partner choice is constrained in numerous contexts. This study seeks to understand the effects of constrained decision-making on partner choice and associated effects on health and well-being. The work will train a graduate student in scientific cultural anthropology and will provide insights relevant to debates about the causes and consequences of variation in human reproductive systems.  <br/><br/>A review of marriage systems indicates that the marrying individuals generally prefer different partners than those selected from within endogamous social networks. The effects of this discordance are not well studied, however. This study will be conducted in a community where roughly half of marriages involve constrained partner choice and half involve marriages in which partners are freely chosen. The research leverages this comparison to ask several important questions about the consequences of constrained reproduction. In particular, the researchers investigate whether more or healthier children result from in constrained versus unconstrained marriage. To understand these relationships, this study will measure marriage satisfaction, birth rates, child survival and growth rates, and child health, as well as material parental contributions in both types of marriages, with the ultimate goal of understanding what benefits unconstrained partner choice might provide. These findings are increasingly relevant to public health issues, especially as scientists struggle to understand the role of other processes that compromise partner-choice mechanisms, including other forms of medically assisted reproduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their importance in the natural cycling of carbon, the oceans have absorbed approximately 40% of the carbon dioxide that has been emitted by fossil fuel burning. Understanding the processes that cause spatial and temporal variations of ocean carbon and oxygen concentrations is critical to predicting how these ocean cycles will develop into the future. Recent measurement-based estimates and computer models agree that ocean carbon uptake increased significantly in the early 1990s and then slowed over the rest of the decade. Observations and models also indicate significant oxygen variations. One possible driver of these patterns that has not been explored is the influence of large volcanic eruptions, specifically Mount Pinatubo in 1991. With the eruption, small particles were forced to great altitude where they spread through the upper atmosphere, reflected sunlight back to space, and led to a temporary cooling of global climate. This project will explore how this temporary cooling influenced ocean circulation, and air-sea carbon and oxygen exchange, by comparing Earth system model simulations that do and do not include the effects of Mt. Pinatubo?s eruption. <br/><br/>Within the framework of NCAR?s Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) effort, the team will complete a new experiment that explicitly excludes forcing from Mt. Pinatubo (CESM-LE-NoVolc). By difference from the existing CESM-LE that includes all forcing, the investigators will directly identify the effects of Mt. Pinatubo and put these effects in context with observed carbon and oxygen change. Specifically, they propose to address two hypotheses: <br/>Hypothesis 1: Trends in surface fluxes and interior distributions of anthropogenic carbon and oxygen since the 1990s have been significantly impacted by Mt. Pinatubo.<br/>Hypothesis 2: After the initial uptake anomaly due to Mt. Pinatubo, thermocline anomalies that are cool and anomalously high in tracers return to the surface. These anomalies suppress air- to-sea fluxes for up to a decade after the eruption. <br/><br/>Recent work has also indicated that variability in the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide has a first-order effect on variability of ocean carbon uptake. The investigators will also do preliminary analysis using one new run of the CESM ocean-ice hindcast and a stratified analysis of CMIP6 models to further explore this issue. Specifically, they propose a third hypothesis: <br/>Hypothesis 3: By including the seasonal cycle and latitudinal distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide in simulations, variability of the globally integrated air-sea carbon flux is increased and becomes more comparable to observationally-based estimates. <br/><br/>By creating CESM-LE-NoVolc, this work will allow for investigation of the forced impact of Mt. Pinatubo on a wide range of ocean biogeochemical and physical processes. Model runs will be made easily available under the CESM-LE project umbrella. Under this research project, graduate and undergraduate research will be supported. The team will continue to our long-standing efforts to attract underrepresented students to science, and to explain ocean and carbon cycle science to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is the very small shaking from nearby sources, or the ultra-low frequency vibration following large events that cause the Earth to ring like a bell for many days afterward, that are difficult to capture.  We are constantly trying to improve seismometers to be able to record this wide range of signals.  Studying them can provide much information about what is inside the Earth.  Seismic waves are the ""light"" that lets us see inside the Earth and seismometers are the ""eyes"" that let us create images of the internal Earth structure.  In addition to shaking, earthquakes and related phenomena cause slow, gradual deformation of Earth's crust.  To detect these deformations, extremely precise sensors are needed.  Two types of deformation are often searched for: a very slight change in the position of the ground with respect to local vertical, called ""tilt,"" and elongation or compression of the ground, called ""strain.""  These are not unrelated, but the types of signals caused by tectonic activity are normally extremely small ? measured by parts per billion in both tilt and strain.  This Division of Erath Science Instrumentation and Facilities Program award supports development of a highly sensitive optical detection method and instrument to measure the motion of masses suspended by pendulums or a spring in a housing cemented into the bottom of a borehole.  Optical fibers send laser light down to the sensor housing and return the light after it has been reflected from mirrors attached to the masses.  By analyzing this light with electronics and a small computer located outside the borehole, the researchers can detect motions of the masses comparable to the diameter of individual atoms, and therefore detect both small seismic shaking and deformation of the ground caused by earthquake-related activity. As the investigators learn more about earthquake processes, the better are the chances of one day making precise forecasts of where and when they might occur.<br/><br/>Support from this award will allow for fabrication and installation of a borehole system that utilizes optical-fiber interferometry to provide in one borehole: (a) a broadband vertical seismometer/gravimeter, (b) a broadband two-component horizontal seismometer/tiltmeter, and (c) a low-noise vertical long baseline strainmeter.  The combined system will be able to measure vertical and horizontal ground velocities, gravity, tilt, and strain with sensitivities that compare favorably with any existing system over time scales from 10 Hz to many days; the downhole components are entirely passive, giving a long instrument lifetime and resistance to high downhole temperatures. The instrument is to be installed in an existing borehole at Pinon Flat Observatory for testing and comparison with the seismic and strain systems already operated there.  The combined instrument promises an alternative to multi-instrument observations from independent seismometers, GPS receivers, gravimeters, tiltmeters and strain meters.  The seismic observations are anticipated to meet the current requirements of Global Seismographic Network stations and geodetic measurements would offer lower noise observations than GPS at periods shorter than weeks.  Target applications could include studies of the dynamics of crustal deformation including slow slip events, continuous and episodic slip, and other Earth movements that are known to occur but which do not generate damaging earthquakes.  A deployed instrument could help to understand the effects of magmatic and subsurface fluid dynamics (e.g., hydrocarbon extraction and CO2 sequestration) on crustal deformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is in the area of dynamical systems. There will be twelve main speakers, and will include early career mathematicians, especially graduate students and post-doctoral scholars. Several important problems originating from various fields in mathematics and computer science can be studied in terms of dynamical systems. The motion of a particle in space has been modeled by the action of a function or transformation of the space. Later mathematicians considered several such functions that were put together in group of transformations and studied what are called group actions. The goal of the conference at Wesleyan is to bring together a variety of researchers and students whose work connects to the study of group actions in dynamics to discuss the latest research findings and to seek collaborations to attack open problems in this area. <br/><br/>Homogeneous dynamics has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of number theory and geometry. Although in many cases qualitative results already suffice for applications, there are situations in which it is essential to obtain effective, quantitative results in homogenous dynamics. It usually involves giving estimates on the rates or error terms which concern various aspects of group actions on spaces. The conference will discuss recent progress on effective equi-distribution and shrinking targets in homogeneous dynamics, and study how these results could help advance the understanding of problems in number theory. Another main topic of the conference is the behavior of dynamical systems modeling a ball bouncing around inside a polygon. This research subject has found exciting connections and applications to algebraic geometry, rigidity theory in geometry, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of mathematics. The conference will host talks on recent works in this direction and discuss their applications to the geometry of tiling, translation surfaces, interval exchange transformations, and related topics. The conference will also include research talks in probability theory and random walks on groups, geometry of nilpotent groups, marked length spectrum, and rigidity of surfaces. It will provide a great opportunity for graduate students to be exposed to different perspectives of the modern theory of dynamical systems and to communicate with conference participants.

A variety of distinguished and early career speakers will participate. Each speaker will give an hour-long talk followed by discussion, collaboration, and workshop activities. Both distinguished and early career speakers will focus on one of five areas: 1) spatial heterogeneity in ecological systems, 2) tumor heterogeneity, 3) stoichiometric heterogeneity, 4) heterogeneity in disease transmission, and 5) behavioral heterogeneity. Additionally, there will be a poster session on a variety of topics. The symposium will provide a unique opportunity to advance research in these fields, to promote collaborations, and to discover novel research directions. More information regarding this minisymposium can be found at http://www.math.ttu.edu/rr2020/<br/><br/>Research efforts at the interface of the fields of mathematics and biology have produced profound results that have deepened understanding of problems in ecology, epidemiology, oncology and sociobiology and contributed to the advancement of both fields. Application of mathematical models and methods have shed light on problems in various subfields of biology, and in turn, new mathematical methods and theories have been developed in response to the complex problems in biology. A growing arsenal of mathematical and computational methods and techniques are needed to study the current problems in biology that are critical to understanding the changing, heterogeneous world. While biological systems are complex compositions of multiple dynamical factors, many mathematical models are simplifications that may lack sufficient heterogeneity to address questions of current importance. As ecosystems continue to change, personal medicine advances, global temperatures shift, and organisms gain anti-microbial resistance, we need realistic models to account for individual, population and ecosystem heterogeneities, now more than ever. The minisymposum Modeling in a Heterogeneous World will enable researchers from different career stages working at the interface of mathematics and biology to meet and to discuss new and exciting methods and techniques for incorporating heterogeneity into realistic biological systems. These interactions and discussions will lay the groundwork for future research in this direction by identifying important open questions and fostering long-term collaborations. Topics presented and discussed will be mathematically significant, spanning dynamical systems theory, stochastic processes, optimal control theory, and game theory, as well as biologically significant, spanning population ecology, oncology, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advancement of fabrication techniques in recent years has spurred a rapid increase in the use of highly deformable materials in a myriad of engineering applications with examples ranging from wearable electronics, and soft robotics, to helmets, and seismic bearings. Dynamic loading of such soft structures can lead to a variety of material phenomena, which can generate significant damage. Protective gear should thus be capable of absorbing dynamic loads, such as impacts and blasts, which are now becoming appreciated as a major threat also to civilian lives in both mundane settings, such as sports, and as a result of more extreme events, such as exposure to improvised explosives. In these situations, both the protective material and the soft biological tissue may be subjected to extreme pressure gradients and impact. However, the basic mechanisms of damage and energy absorption are still poorly understood, thus hindering the maturation of new protective technologies that can mitigate damage in extreme environments.  The integrated research and education plan will resolve deep mechanics questions regarding the shear shock formation criteria and level of energy dissipation and work to broaden participation in the engineering field.<br/> <br/>Recent experimental observations have suggested that the nonlinear evolution of ordinary shear waves into shear shocks could play a significant role in generating damage in soft and biological materials. However, while the vast amount of existing experimental and theoretical research on shock wave propagation in solids revolves around longitudinal shock mechanisms, the study of shear shock formation and propagation, from the point of view of large deformation solid mechanics is in nascent state, and the fundamental nature of these shock processes, the conditions required to form them, the resulting damage, and the level of energy dissipation, remain elusive. Hence, the interpretation of the reported observations is limited. This CAREER award aims to fill this void by employing a complementary combination of theoretical investigation and high-precision experimentation, through which it will illuminate the constitutive sensitivities of shear shock processes and the resulting mechanisms of damage. This fundamental understanding will then guide the design of more resilient material systems and can explain the vulnerability of specific biological organs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groundwater is also an indispensable resource for energy production, agricultural and industrial uses. A karst aquifer is a special type of aquifer that is formed in regions underlain by soluble rocks, typically carbonate rocks. Karst aquifers hold 40% of U.S. groundwater. The dissolution of soluble rocks through time creates a complex groundwater flow system in karst aquifers, which is typically characterized by a network of fractures and conduits that connect to the surface water through sinkholes, sinking streams, and springs.  Those characteristics make karst aquifers potentially vulnerable to both climate change and contamination. The proposed research seeks to enhance understanding of the complex network of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in order to advance the prediction of water flow, surface water and groundwater interaction, contaminant transport, nutrient cycle,  and the carbon cycle in many karst aquifers under increased stresses from human activities.  This project will also greatly benefit the economically distressed karst Appalachian region where students are underrepresented in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). This project is jointly funded by the Hydrologic Sciences (HS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>This research will be centered on conducting collaborative research using a complementary data fusion approach. The approach fuses data collected from hydraulic tomography, river stage tomography, electrical resistivity tomography, and tracer tests to produce a more reliable map of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers in a cost-effective manner. In turn, the results will lead to improved understanding and prediction of flow and solute transport in the karst aquifers.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and validate an innovative approach for characterizing karst aquifers in detail based on the data fusion concept. To achieve this goal, this research will design two new field surveys: surface and subsurface river stage tomography and electrical resistivity tomography with moving current sources. This research will also explore the feasibility of natural lightning tomography for large-scale resistivity surveys. The data collected from these surveys will be integrated into a geostatistical-based inversion framework to characterize the distribution and morphology of fractures and conduits with great detail. The fusion approach will be tested and validated at the Cane Run Royal Spring Basin in central Kentucky. The validity of the characterized karst aquifers will be evaluated using a separate model with the field-collected water level, water chemistry, tracer, and stable isotope data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this period Boston had the densest concentration of biotech firms and housed leading academic biomedical research centers in the United States, but the development of this dense biotechnology cluster remains understudied. This project would first develop a detailed history of the biotechnology industry in Boston, conceptualizing it as an interconnected regional ecology of actors and organizations, whereas past research focused largely on the influence of individual firms, typically in San Francisco. Second, the project would focus on issues of work and labor in biotechnology, considering the extent to which the behavior of biotechnology firms and choice of their locations are influenced by the convergence of capital investment and academic culture and values. Finally, the project would use this case to conceptualize the development of bioeconomies centered on innovation in the life sciences to understand how science, universities, and public policy enable economic growth, and who benefits from it. Methodologically, the project is based in oral histories from scientists, entrepreneurs, academic experts, citizens, and government officials, and in analyses of materials in newspapers and historical archives. The project will produce a book aimed at a general readership, and specialized articles in urban history, innovation studies, and science and technology studies. The Principal Investigator will also design an undergraduate class on the history of biotechnology, maintain a collection of oral history interviews for future researchers, and contribute to museum exhibits documenting biotechnology around Boston. <br/><br/>Through studying the development of the biotechnology on a regional basis rather than through the experience of individual entrepreneurs or companies, the project provides a more complete picture of how the ""bioeconomy,? a new species of innovation-based economic growth, developed and functioned in practice. The rise of biotechnology was not only a product of the convergence of entrepreneurship and scientific innovation, but also a consequence of shifts in the identity of working biologists and regional redevelopment initiatives by areas facing deindustrialization. In turn this entails expanding understanding of the types of people who had an impact on the industry?s growth. Addressing and analyzing these perspectives allows the project to contribute to broader discussions regarding how the life sciences, university research, and investors produce innovation and economic development, and raises concerns that current expert discussions of the bioeconomy fail to account for the protest and dissent that shadowed the development of the bioeconomy in places such as the Greater Boston Area. The project thus provides a more critical and nuanced investigation of innovation hubs in urban areas and practical information for politicians, policy-makers, and other stakeholders to understand the costs and benefits of promoting high-tech sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop a new approach to analyze how people make decisions between trying new experiences or continuing with long standing choices. The new approach applies to many real world situations that are not well explained with existing models. For instance, an investor might invest in one stock while gathering information on the returns to a different investment. A policymaker might explore new alternatives while implementing existing policy. An employee might search for a new job while continuing her current employment. The model applies to these situations where an individual chooses between multiple projects with unknown rewards and can invest in one to earn a reward while also observing the rewards of different projects. The new model is an alternative to a large class of models from economics and statistics that has studied a different kind of experimentation problem, often referred to as the bandit problem. In a bandit problem, the decision maker can only learn through investing. She gains information only about the project that she chooses: what she learns is linked to what she earns. The result is a well-known trade-off between exploration and exploitation: the decision - maker may desire investment in a low reward project because it offers valuable learning. The existing group of bandit models have been widely applied. The new research funded by this grant could result in deeper understanding of a similarly wide range of applications, including applications that could enhance national security and strengthen the US economy.<br/> <br/><br/>The research team will consider three environments that offer a particularly stark contrast with the classical experimentation framework. First, when experimentation is conducted by individuals, the optimal alternative is always eventually discovered. This contrasts with the classical result of incomplete learning in classical experimentation with discounting. However, behavior is more complex than in standard experimentation environments since a simple index (such as the Gittins index,which characterizes solutions in the classical framework) need not exist. Second, teams composed of similar members are no longer subject to free-rider problems: when observation and exploitation are separated, teams achieve efficient experimentation. The team will also analyze questions that cannot be addressed in the standard setting. Specifically, the project explores a delegation environment in which there are two agents: the executive (Doer), who chooses the project to be implemented, and the intelligence agency (Observer), who chooses what project to look at. Because the objectives of these two agents may be misaligned, delegated choices may yield either minimal or maximal experimentation depending on the nature of contact between the doer and the observer. Ultimately, the project has the potential to uncover novel features of experimentation that can be applied to various applications and tested against data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different tomato varieties show significant differences in heat sensitivity of pollen tube growth. Making use of this naturally occurring variety, this project seeks to identify the molecular basis of adaptations that mitigate the yield-damaging consequences of heat stress during crop reproduction. The goal is to develop new tomato varieties that are fertile and continue to produce fruits at high temperature. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in genome science, developmental biology, and computational analysis of genetic variation. The project will build on the successful outreach program developed by one of the team members. This program has been used to teach plant genetics and the science of plant breeding and genetic engineering to more than 1000 9th grade students, tailoring it to focus on the effects of temperature stress on tomato reproduction.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that thermotolerant tomato varieties express a pollen tube heat stress response that is either absent or diminished in thermosensitive cultivars and that the thermotolerant pistil buffers heat stress and facilitates pollen tube growth. To identify the molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance in tomato, transcription changes that accompany heat stress in pollen tubes and pistil will be measured in heat tolerant and heat sensitive tomato varieties. Haploid selection mapping of pollen tube heat tolerance will be performed, followed by experimental tests whether identified candidate genes are causally related to heat tolerance. This project will generate accessible and readily available community databases 1) detailing reproductive gene expression responses to elevated temperature and 2) registering genetic variants across hundreds of tomato genomes to enable analysis of heat stress adaptation and other traits. The project will define the transcriptional changes that accompany heat stress in the pollen tube and pistil (Aim 1), genetic variation responsible for pollen tube thermotolerance (Aims 2 and 3), and the functions of individual thermotolerance genes using reverse genetics (Aim 4).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simulations of earth's climate thus require an approximate representation of these flows which is fast enough to be practical and accurate enough to capture phenomena of interest, such as the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The development of such representations, referred to as radiative transfer parameterizations or more simply as radiation schemes, is challenging given that the transparency of the atmosphere to infrared radiation can vary abruptly from one wavelength to another. Practical radiation schemes exist, but they are challenging to develop and update and it is not generally feasible to tailor them to specific applications. For example the version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) available in 2020 uses a radiation scheme published in 2008, despite the availability of new spectroscopic observations, and the same version is used for full-complexity present-day simulations and for idealized simulations that would benefit from a faster but less accurate version.<br/><br/>This award supports the creation of a toolkit that would greatly enhance the ability of climate researchers to create radiative transfer parameterizations suitable for their needs.  The user would supply a set of benchmark atmospheres, specified as profiles of temperature and composition (water vapor and CO2, for instance), that cover the range of conditions anticipated in the particular application, and the toolbox would use a sophisticated line-by-line radiative transfer model and a database of up-to-date spectroscopic observations to create parameterization options with varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost.  Users would then be able to choose the best trade-off between cost and accuracy for their application.  In addition, the project creates parameterizations for specific research goals: one for simulations of paleoclimates with high CO2 concentrations and two for studies of the interaction between radiation and convective clouds (one emphasizing speed, which can be invoked more frequently, and one emphasizing accuracy).  A third, developed with collaborators at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (funded through other sources), is optimized for simulations of present-day climate and prediction of climate fluctuations including El Nino events.<br/><br/>The project also includes work on alternative methods for parameterizing radiative transfer, one of which is a discrete frequency approximation, in which an optimally chosen set of strictly monochromatic spectral lines is used instead of a representation in terms of frequency bands.  The lines are determined from the spectral database using a fast optimization technique such as simulated annealing.  The second is a machine learning approach designed to emulate the underlying exact solutions to the radiative transfer equations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through the development of a key piece of infrastructure for weather and climate models.  The work will thus have benefit for the worldwide community that relies on these models as tools for basic science research.  Workshops and tutorials are supported to facilitate community engagement.  The work also enhances the value of model-based predictions and projections as guidance for decision makers concerned with climate variability and change. The project supports a postdoc and a graduate student, thus providing for the future workforce in climate model development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology is able to track blood-oxygen-level dependent signals over time and serve as a proxy to neural activity. Current approaches have limitations, as they assume that the interdependence between distinct brain regions is constant throughout recording periods. These approaches also assume that the brain is an isolated system that does not consider outside stimulus. To capture the highly complex dynamics and to enable the understanding of the neural basis of human cognition this research project will develop new data analysis methods for processing brain activity to explain the relationships involved in attention, learning, memory, decision-making, and language. This multidisciplinary effort will also enable the training of a new generation of engineers and clinicians, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups, who can use the new data analytics to aid them during decision-making to assess the brain?s health enabling earlier diagnostics. The results of this research will have a great impact on healthcare and benefit the U.S. economy and society.<br/> <br/>To capture the highly complex spatiotemporal brain activity, this grant supports development of a model-based approach that captures the non-stationarity and fractal behavior of the brain dynamics. As a consequence, it will unveil dynamical characteristics that can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively measure how well an individual is doing in a particular task (e.g., attention/memory). Furthermore, the model-based approach in this project lays down the framework to perform control where quantitative measures can be used to establish control objectives regarding success in performing a given task. Unlike currently employed short-range memory models, this project focuses on a generalized mathematical framework that captures the degree of a memory of brain activity. Thus, the research will provide new insights and information about the brain organization and cognition that may fundamentally change the way one examines neuro-related data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall Consortium vision is to be a collaboration of Minority Serving Institutions working as one to advance the Electrical and Computer Engineering enterprise. It is organized as a virtual multi-university super department with broadly based strengths in education, scholarship and service. Collectively, the Consortium can function as the equal of any Electrical and Computer Engineering program, accomplish more and have a greater impact on its students, faculty and staff through access to resources and opportunities not available to its members individually. Thus, the Consortium enables research and educational collaboration of teams from its partners working as peers with faculty, staff and students from the largest research-intensive universities in the United States.  A full-day workshop at the 2020 annual meeting of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association in Orlando, Florida, brings Consortium members together with academic leaders in Electrical and Computer Engineering throughout the country. This workshop is a major step in testing strategies developed within the Consortium to more fully and productively engage joint cross-institutional teams in the US education and research enterprise. <br/><br/>The majority of Inclusive Engineering Consortium members participated in the National Science Foundation-funded Experimental Centric Pedagogy project. Through this experience, Consortium member institutions have developed a culture of collaboration with effective methods of implementation. This initial collaboration is being leveraged and extended. The hypothesis is that there are windows of opportunity open through the establishment of research and educational collaborations between Consortium members with research-intensive institutions. This is especially true since its member institutions serve a unique population of minority students. The Consortium is developing the infrastructure and programs to facilitate collaborations between faculty, students and staff among its member departments based on lessons learned from the successful Experiment Centric Pedagogy educational program and, more generally, the science of team science. It is also addressing how best to build a different type of team structure with research-intensive universities, industry, and other external constituencies. Preparation for the workshop includes defining and refining a process and set of tools for successful collaboration with each type of partner, especially research-intensive universities. The workshop activities are structured to test the collaboration process and tools for research-intensive universities by actively engaging Consortium partner faculty with department heads from research-intensive universities and other faculty attending the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association meeting. This is an important step in creating the organizational support structure and activities necessary to realize the Consortium?s grand vision of graduating more and better prepared minority engineers, increasing efficiency and productivity at Minority Serving Institutions, and developing a sustainable and effective infrastructure to support minority students, faculty and staff at all universities. In time, as the Consortium grows beyond the disciplines of Electrical and Computer Engineering, this model can be replicated and implemented for other areas of engineering education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop a new approach to analyze how people make decisions between trying new experiences or continuing with long standing choices. The new approach applies to many real world situations that are not well explained with existing models. For instance, an investor might invest in one stock while gathering information on the returns to a different investment. A policymaker might explore new alternatives while implementing existing policy. An employee might search for a new job while continuing her current employment. The model applies to these situations where an individual chooses between multiple projects with unknown rewards and can invest in one to earn a reward while also observing the rewards of different projects. The new model is an alternative to a large class of models from economics and statistics that has studied a different kind of experimentation problem, often referred to as the bandit problem. In a bandit problem, the decision maker can only learn through investing. She gains information only about the project that she chooses: what she learns is linked to what she earns. The result is a well-known trade-off between exploration and exploitation: the decision - maker may desire investment in a low reward project because it offers valuable learning. The existing group of bandit models have been widely applied. The new research funded by this grant could result in deeper understanding of a similarly wide range of applications, including applications that could enhance national security and strengthen the US economy.<br/> <br/><br/>The research team will consider three environments that offer a particularly stark contrast with the classical experimentation framework. First, when experimentation is conducted by individuals, the optimal alternative is always eventually discovered. This contrasts with the classical result of incomplete learning in classical experimentation with discounting. However, behavior is more complex than in standard experimentation environments since a simple index (such as the Gittins index,which characterizes solutions in the classical framework) need not exist. Second, teams composed of similar members are no longer subject to free-rider problems: when observation and exploitation are separated, teams achieve efficient experimentation. The team will also analyze questions that cannot be addressed in the standard setting. Specifically, the project explores a delegation environment in which there are two agents: the executive (Doer), who chooses the project to be implemented, and the intelligence agency (Observer), who chooses what project to look at. Because the objectives of these two agents may be misaligned, delegated choices may yield either minimal or maximal experimentation depending on the nature of contact between the doer and the observer. Ultimately, the project has the potential to uncover novel features of experimentation that can be applied to various applications and tested against data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These measurements comprise the longest continuous geochemical records of several key atmospheric trace gases and have direct relevance for understanding climate changes and related changes in land and ocean ecosystems at high northern latitudes.  CO2 not only is a critical greenhouse gas but its variations are diagnostic of photosynthesis and respiration of land ecosystems, such as tundra and forests, which support the food-web and health of Arctic ecosystems.  Related measurements of atmospheric species, such as O2 and the isotopes of CO2, complement and expand this knowledge base.  Previous measurements of atmospheric CO2 reveal clearly that dramatic changes have occurred in the cycling of carbon at high latitudes.  Larger changes are likely to occur in the decades ahead and models alone cannot inform our understanding of those outcomes.  Hence, atmospheric measurements comprise a key element of an observing system that will allow understanding of how fast and in what respect these systems are changing.  This project not only continues long-term flask measurements but also initiates new atmospheric measurements through in situ instrumentation to be installed at Utqiagvik, Alaska. <br/><br/>This project supports flask collections at Cold Bay and Utqiagvik, Alaska, and at Alert Station on Ellesmere Island.  The flasks will be returned to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where they will be analyzed for CO2 concentration, the stable isotopes of CO2, and the O2/N2 and Ar/N2 ratios.  The project will also support the installation and operation of an in situ O2/N2 analyzer system at Utqiagvik, Alaska.  This new installation will enable the study of O2 exchanges with the nearby Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas based on the ability to resolve short-term signals of regional origin.  Augmenting these data collection efforts, this project will support data analysis to detect and quantify long-term changes in the measured atmospheric trace gases, with a particular focus on changes in seasonal cycles.  In addition, it will support comparisons between the observed variations in O2 at Utqiagvik with estimates of the expected variations simulated in state-of-the art numerical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference focuses on a confluence of areas in algebraic topology that are currently at the forefront of research: arithmetic topology, chromatic homotopy theory, applied topology, manifold topology, and geometric representation theory. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students and to junior researchers without other funding sources, and among those to members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. Algebraic topology is enjoying a growing diversity, which this conference will foster through the selection of speakers and participants. This conference is quite timely in light of the research growth in algebraic topology seen on the East Coast in recent years and the resulting growth of student groups in the subject. <br/> <br/>Modern algebraic topology is intimately tied to a host of fields. From Thom's thesis to the Madsen-Weiss theorem and beyond, stable homotopy theory has long played a crucial role in the study of manifolds. More recently, sophisticated techniques of equivariant stable homotopy theory were brought to bear in the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem concerning exotic smooth structures on spheres, opening new research directions and applications. On the other hand, homotopy theory is connected to algebraic geometry via motivic homotopy theory and applications such as those of abstract scissors congruence K-theory to the classical Grothendieck ring of varieties. Moreover, algebraic topology has seen notable recent application to the study of data in the emerging field of topological data analysis. One of the aims for this conference is to provide a sample of new directions in algebraic topology and interactions with other fields such as geometric topology, arithmetic geometry, and applied topology. The conference features nine 45-minute invited talks over two days. The scientific focus of the conference is decidedly forward-looking: the speakers are rising leaders in the field and include early career researchers; each speaker represents a distinct and vital aspect of the topology of the future.

Project goals are to provide experienced, exemplary STEM teachers with opportunities to build their leadership skills in three core areas: field-based instructional materials design, coaching, and collaboration. A total of 14 exemplary multi-disciplinary STEM teachers will be selected as Master Teaching Fellows for this six-year project. The project addresses knowledge gaps in informal STEM for rural communities and builds on the knowledge base about teacher collaboration. The project tests the potential for improving STEM education through development and use of teacher-designed field stations as teaching sites for STEM subjects.  It focuses on rural border areas that lack opportunities for informal STEM learning. In addition, it gives Master Teaching Fellows the training and support to become classroom coaches and to lead a professional learning community, providing teachers the opportunity to design and lead teacher development efforts in an underserved border area. Project evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach including front-end, formative, and summative evaluation phases. Dissemination plans include research publications and conference presentations, a Sin Fronteras website that Master Teaching Fellows will design and maintain, and local media coverage. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Ride-hailing platforms, which are rapidly replacing traditional taxi services, are a canonical example of algorithmic management, where the software platform uses a variety of opaque means to automatically assign and evaluate work. The research community has had difficulty studying and improving these platforms, due to the platforms' proprietary and closed nature. This has exposed both drivers and passengers to biased or unfair outcomes, such as passengers poorly rating minority drivers or drivers declining rides from certain categories of customer. At the root of these problems are the opaque mechanisms for algorithmic management, and the several research and community efforts to make algorithmic management more palatable have largely impacted isolated functionality. These isolated cases point to a larger and urgent need to re-imagine these platforms as equitable workplaces, where we hold our algorithmic managers (and the people that develop them) to the same standard that we hold human managers.  This work has the potential to extensively inform and redefine the standards and policies around how platforms that algorithmically manage work should be designed to form more equitable work environments.<br/> <br/>To accomplish this goal it is necessary to build a more open platform, so that we can directly investigate these mechanisms.  This project will develop an experimental ride-hailing platform that gives drivers and passengers control over parameters that impact algorithmic outcomes, as a means to understand and interact with the platform. It will serve as a testbed to conduct a series of mixed-methods studies that progressively increase in size and scope. These studies will be focused on three major themes: (1) understandable individual interactions with algorithmic managers, (2) equitable group interactions through algorithmic managers, and (3) self-governance for organizations with algorithmic management. In partnership with independent drivers and experts in labor relations, evaluation studies  will use the platform to generate foundational knowledge about giving workers more control over the algorithms that manage them. Due to the open source nature of this work, any group that wants to begin their own cooperative platform will be able to utilize the application, tools, and resources developed in this research. These contributions will have a wide impact on how work is managed by algorithms and how to create human-centered algorithms and platforms for work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although many of these individuals have obvious limitations in mobility, unbeknownst to the general public is that nearly all lack control of their bladder and have to use catheters, typically 4 to 6 times per day, to empty their bladder. This high frequency of emptying adds ""insult to injury."" A common problem is making the difficult trip to the bathroom in a wheelchair or requesting help from a caregiver to only find a small amount of urine in the bladder, or not making it to the bathroom in time and leaking urine because the bladder was too full. Lack of the bladder fullness sensation is a major problem for individuals living with SCI, which significantly reduces their social activities and quality of life and increases their care complexity and cost. To address this problem, the project aims to build a non-invasive wearable device, which can be discreetly worn by SCI patients under their clothing, to receive (or to send to their caregivers) timely alerts for starting to look for a bathroom to perform self- or assisted-catheterization.  The accuracy of the device will automatically and incrementally improve every time the SCI subject or his/her caregiver provides feedback on its performance.  Furthermore, the project includes specific education and outreach activities that are driven by integration of research results into courses and recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented backgrounds into STEM education. Of particular note are efforts to reach out to local high school and middle school students, parents, and their teachers via the UC-Davis CSTEM center and the Sacramento Regional Science & Engineering Fair.<br/><br/>Most individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI) have neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) and lack sensation and control of their bladder, which typically leads to scheduled catheterizations that are often not needed or are too late.  Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a non-invasive, patch-like device that can be worn by SCI patients to receive timely alerts for starting to look for a bathroom to perform catheterization. The Research Plan is organized under three aims:  The FIRST Aim is to leverage the principles of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)to build a device that utilizes an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors with fixed distances to infer information about spatial expansion of the bladder. The underlying physical principle exploited by the device is measurement of back scattered light at wavelengths for which water has an appropriate absorption coefficient, while other tissue chromophores are not highly absorptive (e.g., 975 nm).  The device will be designed to be worn discreetly on the lower abdomen in the pelvic area, to run on the battery for at least a full waking day, to be very flexible, to have an area about twice that of a credit card, and to be only a few millimeters thick.  The fundamental tradeoffs between system complexity and usefulness to patients will be investigated, e.g., the number of LEDs and photodetectors in the optical probe, the LED driving current and the battery size. Monte Carlo simulations of light propagation in bladder models will be used to estimate the quality of design candidates, and a cost function based on the number of LED/detectors and probe size will be developed.  The SECOND Aim is to build and train machine learning models for bladder fill state prediction.  Design tradeoffs among algorithm complexity, prediction accuracy, energy consumptions, and value proposition to SCI patients will be considered in determining what features and algorithms should be used.  Algorithms will first be investigated for their ability to output discrete outcomes, e.g., alert (bladder volume is high enough) or no alert (bladder volume is too low). If relatively simple algorithms such as logistic regression and linear support vector machine (SVM) do not achieve the desired level of accuracy using a reasonable number of features, more sophisticated nonlinear SVMs using kernel trick with different choices of kernels will be used.  Similarly, the possibility of regression methods that can predict the bladder volume from the collected features will be investigated. Algorithms will also be designed to automatically and adaptively determine the next time instance for measuring the diffuse optical signal and to incorporate the user's feedback to continuously improve the device's prediction accuracy.  The THIRD Aim is to evaluate the feasibility of the approach in both short and day-long studies in 25 healthy and 25 SCI human subjects. The evaluation plan includes collecting real patient/caregiver feedback on practical issues that users will face as the device is used and to collect sufficient amount of data for development of predictive models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research develops new strategies for the synthesis of terpenoids, naturally occurring small molecules that have a variety of biological functions. Many of these terpenoid molecules can only be obtained in small quantities from natural sources.  Laboratory methods to prepare them in an efficient manner still remain an unsolved challenge. The research uses nature?s catalysts, i.e. enzymes, to modify starting materials and produce useful building blocks.  The building blocks are then used to prepare a wide range of terpenoids. Streamlined access to terpenoids enabled by this research strategies helps support further studies on their physiological functions. Students working on these studies receive important training in chemical and biological sciences to support their future careers in science and engineering. Concomitant with the research activities, the Professor Renata is organizing outreach efforts including classroom education and public engagement to cultivate interest in science among young students and members of the local community.<br/><br/>The Renata lab aims to develop novel strategies to access important natural products by incorporating biocatalytic transformations. The goal of this project is to establish chemoenzymatic means to access oxidized terpenoids with unique structural motifs, specifically terpenoids bearing ?trans-trans-trans?, ?trans-trans-syn? and ?trans-syn-trans? ring junctions. This is achieved by combining site-selective biocatalytic oxidation of readily available feedstock terpenes and state-of-the-art chemical methodologies for carbon-carbon bond constructions. Studies in this area help formulate a new type of synthetic logic (?chemoenzymatic logic?) for accessing complex molecules with interesting architectures. To complement the research activities, outreach efforts, new coursework material in biocatalysis, and an external lecture series are designed to encourage participation in science among young students, underrepresented groups and members of the local community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeology is well positioned to evaluate this issue because its emphasis on space, time, and objects allows for the reconstruction of how past social agents navigated significant shifts in colonial strategies over time. This is particularly important considering the broadscale social and economic shifts that occurred during the Mission period. While the initial goal of the mission system was to convert local peoples into loyal Spanish subjects, new policies helped free mission laborers from Franciscan rule. The assessment of materials deposited within earlier and later Mission contexts can thus not only provide new insights into the operation of colonialism but can also be used to ascertain the political strategies and daily practices employed by Native groups during these distinct periods in time. These data can be used as a comparative to other regions throughout California, and even across the globe, to understand the differing impacts of colonial policies on indigenous populations and the way that local groups navigated colonialism using their own system of meanings and values. The research will be conducted with the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians and California State Parks. <br/><br/>Given this broader context, this project undertakes research to study the social organization of one Native community within a mission setting and evaluate how they responded to the retreat of the Spanish frontier inside the mission space. The study of indigenous experiences at Mission La Pursima Concepcon offers an ideal lens through which to investigate these issues because two distinct stratigraphic/ chronological groups have been previously identified. By exploring labor practices, foodways, craft industries, and trade and exchange from these two distinct contexts, this project sheds light on how the Chumash community at the Mission navigated new colonial policies and relations over time. These results are used to understand evolving indigenous social identities at the community level and regional scale given the broader historical background of sea change happening in Alta California under colonialism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their importance in the natural cycling of carbon, the oceans have absorbed approximately 40% of the carbon dioxide that has been emitted by fossil fuel burning. Understanding the processes that cause spatial and temporal variations of ocean carbon and oxygen concentrations is critical to predicting how these ocean cycles will develop into the future. Recent measurement-based estimates and computer models agree that ocean carbon uptake increased significantly in the early 1990s and then slowed over the rest of the decade. Observations and models also indicate significant oxygen variations. One possible driver of these patterns that has not been explored is the influence of large volcanic eruptions, specifically Mount Pinatubo in 1991. With the eruption, small particles were forced to great altitude where they spread through the upper atmosphere, reflected sunlight back to space, and led to a temporary cooling of global climate. This project will explore how this temporary cooling influenced ocean circulation, and air-sea carbon and oxygen exchange, by comparing Earth system model simulations that do and do not include the effects of Mt. Pinatubo?s eruption. <br/><br/>Within the framework of NCAR?s Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) effort, the team will complete a new experiment that explicitly excludes forcing from Mt. Pinatubo (CESM-LE-NoVolc). By difference from the existing CESM-LE that includes all forcing, the investigators will directly identify the effects of Mt. Pinatubo and put these effects in context with observed carbon and oxygen change. Specifically, they propose to address two hypotheses: <br/>Hypothesis 1: Trends in surface fluxes and interior distributions of anthropogenic carbon and oxygen since the 1990s have been significantly impacted by Mt. Pinatubo.<br/>Hypothesis 2: After the initial uptake anomaly due to Mt. Pinatubo, thermocline anomalies that are cool and anomalously high in tracers return to the surface. These anomalies suppress air- to-sea fluxes for up to a decade after the eruption. <br/><br/>Recent work has also indicated that variability in the growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide has a first-order effect on variability of ocean carbon uptake. The investigators will also do preliminary analysis using one new run of the CESM ocean-ice hindcast and a stratified analysis of CMIP6 models to further explore this issue. Specifically, they propose a third hypothesis: <br/>Hypothesis 3: By including the seasonal cycle and latitudinal distribution of atmospheric carbon dioxide in simulations, variability of the globally integrated air-sea carbon flux is increased and becomes more comparable to observationally-based estimates. <br/><br/>By creating CESM-LE-NoVolc, this work will allow for investigation of the forced impact of Mt. Pinatubo on a wide range of ocean biogeochemical and physical processes. Model runs will be made easily available under the CESM-LE project umbrella. Under this research project, graduate and undergraduate research will be supported. The team will continue to our long-standing efforts to attract underrepresented students to science, and to explain ocean and carbon cycle science to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simulations of earth's climate thus require an approximate representation of these flows which is fast enough to be practical and accurate enough to capture phenomena of interest, such as the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The development of such representations, referred to as radiative transfer parameterizations or more simply as radiation schemes, is challenging given that the transparency of the atmosphere to infrared radiation can vary abruptly from one wavelength to another. Practical radiation schemes exist, but they are challenging to develop and update and it is not generally feasible to tailor them to specific applications. For example the version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) available in 2020 uses a radiation scheme published in 2008, despite the availability of new spectroscopic observations, and the same version is used for full-complexity present-day simulations and for idealized simulations that would benefit from a faster but less accurate version.<br/><br/>This award supports the creation of a toolkit that would greatly enhance the ability of climate researchers to create radiative transfer parameterizations suitable for their needs.  The user would supply a set of benchmark atmospheres, specified as profiles of temperature and composition (water vapor and CO2, for instance), that cover the range of conditions anticipated in the particular application, and the toolbox would use a sophisticated line-by-line radiative transfer model and a database of up-to-date spectroscopic observations to create parameterization options with varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost.  Users would then be able to choose the best trade-off between cost and accuracy for their application.  In addition, the project creates parameterizations for specific research goals: one for simulations of paleoclimates with high CO2 concentrations and two for studies of the interaction between radiation and convective clouds (one emphasizing speed, which can be invoked more frequently, and one emphasizing accuracy).  A third, developed with collaborators at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (funded through other sources), is optimized for simulations of present-day climate and prediction of climate fluctuations including El Nino events.<br/><br/>The project also includes work on alternative methods for parameterizing radiative transfer, one of which is a discrete frequency approximation, in which an optimally chosen set of strictly monochromatic spectral lines is used instead of a representation in terms of frequency bands.  The lines are determined from the spectral database using a fast optimization technique such as simulated annealing.  The second is a machine learning approach designed to emulate the underlying exact solutions to the radiative transfer equations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through the development of a key piece of infrastructure for weather and climate models.  The work will thus have benefit for the worldwide community that relies on these models as tools for basic science research.  Workshops and tutorials are supported to facilitate community engagement.  The work also enhances the value of model-based predictions and projections as guidance for decision makers concerned with climate variability and change. The project supports a postdoc and a graduate student, thus providing for the future workforce in climate model development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct measurements of the responsible stresses are impossible because the processes are dangerous to approach or occur deep underground. Minerals are passive passengers within these dynamic environments, who then become valuable recorders of stress as they are deformed. Emergent synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction and Raman spectroscopy technologies now make it possible to quantify geologic stresses by carefully measuring changes in the atomic structure of minerals. For this CAREER award, the investigator and his team will perform fundamental research to fully explore and validate mineral and crystal deformation studies. The research program will dovetail with a 3-tiered education program that relies upon the intrinsic beauty of gemstones to capture the minds and imagination of its audience. The PI will introduce an interactive mineral display to the local museum, implement a Gems course for non-major undergraduates, and develop of a geovisualization lab for diverse graduate student research. <br/><br/>Minerals provide an in-situ record of dynamic geologic processes because their growth and deformation respond to the surrounding environment. Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction and Raman spectroscopy are new tools for quantifying how minerals are deformed. Synchrotron microdiffraction works by using X-ray diffraction patterns to structurally characterize minerals with micron spatial resolution. Raman spectroscopy is similarly high resolution, but instead measures strain by exploiting a mineral?s elastic response to changes in temperature or pressure. Together, these tools have the potential transform the chemistry-based high temperature geosciences into a discipline also rooted in physics and material science. The first proposed project will combine synchrotron microdiffraction with Raman spectroscopy to directly correlate crystal structure with Raman band position. Such efforts will define how crystal structure and deformation mechanisms change with changing pressure-temperature conditions. Second, pink deformation bands in rare, financially valuable diamonds will be measured using synchrotron microdiffraction. Results will identify the origin of pink color in diamonds, and importantly, constrain strain rates and stresses in the Earth?s deep lithospheric mantle. Finally, Raman thermobarometry will be performed on samples collected across a full transect of a crustal section at the Famatinian Arc, Argentina. The reliability of Raman estimates will thus be tested against critical stratigraphic constraints and independent thermobarometers. Each project provides new constraints on mineral deformation mechanisms and mechanical processes active in the subsurface. Students working on this project will be prepared for careers in academia or industry as leaders in spectroscopy, diffraction, crystallography, and geovisualization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goals of this REU program are i) to provide undergraduate students from the USA with mentoring and access to high quality, hands on research opportunities in Oceanography and the opportunity to understand its interdisciplinary nature, ii) improve the capability and confidence of students to learn independently, iii) increase the participation of underrepresented and first generation students in marine science careers and iv) help to prepare undergraduates for their professional careers. <br/><br/>Students will have an opportunity to work with Bigelow scientists, who have expertise in topics such as chemical and biological oceanography, modeling, satellite-oceanography, genomics, organismal and population biology, fisheries and air-sea gas exchange, and who approach biological oceanography as an inter-disciplinary science. Bigelow?s REU program combines group learning and guided individual research to help students address societal issues concerning the oceans. As a group, students participate in a sampling cruise on the local estuary, and attend weekly meetings to learn the fundamentals of the scientific process, such as how to form testable hypotheses, critically evaluate data, and present information in a scientific manner to peers and to the public. Students attend an ethics in science discussion, a lab safety course with risk assessment training and a concept mapping workshop during the early stages of their project. Students will participate in public outreach through attendance at Bigelow?s weekly Caf Scientifique talks (for the general public), participation in the Lab?s Open House and frequent public lab tours. Individual learning experiences includes mentor-guided independent research, experimentation and/or fieldwork, and compiling and evaluating data in a wide arena of oceanographic topics. As part of their projects, students may have the opportunity to scuba dive, sample directly from the Bigelow?s Pier or participate in research cruises. Following the program, many students have the opportunity to present their research at international meetings or publish results from their REU experience. Funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel and some administrative costs. The program will provide a total of thirty-six students with research experience and professional development and will contribute to the development of the next generation of U.S. ocean scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heavy rain is both a threat and an essential resource for the populous countries of the tropics, and the deep convective clouds that produce it serve as the ""boiler"" of the heat engine that drives the global atmospheric circulation. The study of tropical precipitation, including its dependence on SST, sensitivity to greenhouse warming, depth of convective clouds, and other factors is thus a primary research area in climate dynamics.<br/><br/>A characteristic feature of the tropics is the lack of strong temperature contrasts, particularly at levels above the turbulent motions generated near the earth's surface. The uniformity of atmospheric temperature has motivated theories of tropical precipitation  based on the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, in which the net effect of large-scale atmospheric dynamics is to impose a vertical temperature profile in the atmospheric columns where convection and precipitation are occurring.  Under this assumption convection and precipitation can be understood as a consequence of physics and thermodynamics occurring locally within a single atmospheric column, without taking the large-scale three-dimensional circulation into account. Thus, single column models (SCMs) using the WTG approximation have become important tools for understanding tropical convection and precipitation.<br/><br/>Work performed here develops and uses SCMs built on variants of the WTG approximation to address the response of tropical precipitation to external forcing.  One goal is to examine theories of the response of precipitation to greenhouse warming framed in terms of gross moist stability (GMS), a stability measure based on the exchange of thermodynamic energy between the column and its surroundings.  Reductions in GMS due to the moistening of the atmosphere with increasing temperature tend to increase precipitation but GMS can also increase if warming causes convective clouds to become taller.  A further complication is that GMS increases if warmer conditions cause the height of the strongest updrafts within clouds to increase, even if the clouds themselves do not get taller.  This effect can be captured in SCMs using the WTG approximation but there are large discrepancies in results from SCMs with different representations of column physics.  Another form of external forcing examined here is heating in the stratosphere above the column, and the PIs attempt to reconcile differing precipitation responses to stratospheric heating found in earlier studies.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the substantial societal impacts of changes in tropical precipitation, as work performed here has direct relevance to the development of models used to predict the weather and climate of the tropics. The PIs also serve the broader climate science community by making their SCM versions available as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). SCMs are commonly used as part of a hierarchy of models, in which full-complexity climate models are used to simulate phenomena of interest and simpler models are used to isolate particular physical mechanisms and test hypotheses regarding their roles in the full-complexity simulations. The SCMs developed in this project use column physics representations taken from CESM and are fully compatible with CESM software, thus they can be easily incorporated into the model hierarchy developed for CESM.  In addition, the work provides support and training to a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These low-frequency surf zone eddies provide a mechanism for cross-shore dispersion and exchange of material between the shore and the inner continental shelf. This study tests the hypothesis that low-frequency surf zone currents may be the result of energy transfer from breaking waves. Existing data from an extensive two-dimensional array of wave and current sensors will be analyzed to investigate the inverse energy cascade to lower frequencies. Due to limitations in the spatial scales resolvable by the existing data, new data will be collected through the deployment of an alongshore array of wave and current sensors in the surf zone. The sensor deployment will occur during a multi-agency-funded field project to take place in 2020, leveraging significant infrastructure and ancillary measurements. In addition to understanding the contribution of these low frequency oscillations to material exchange between the surf zone and the coastal ocean, the study will also address the need for exposure of future scientists and professional engineers in field data collection and analysis. The project will provide students and young coastal professionals field data collection experiences and 1-week long workshops in analyzing field observations. In addition, the research will form part of the dissertation of an MIT-WHOI PhD student advised by the PIs.<br/><br/>There are several hypotheses for the generation of low-frequency surf zone motions, including instabilities of mean currents (shear waves), slow modulations of the incident wave field (wave groups), and nonlinear energy transfers (breaking waves). The wide range of observed wave conditions in existing field data sets, combined with new observations will allow separation and isolation of these mechanisms. Preliminary analyses of surf zone observations suggest that some statistics of the low-frequency current field are consistent with the expectations of a two-dimensional inverse energy cascade. Based on preliminary results, two hypotheses have been formulated and will be investigated as part of this project: (1) vortical energy with spatial scales of a few meters injected into the surf zone at the ends of high frequency (50  to 300 mHz) breaking wind waves is transferred to low-frequency (< 4 mHz) surf zone currents via a two-dimensional inverse cascade, and (2) enstrophy (the integral of vorticity squared) is transferred from breaking-wave-generated vorticity to smaller-scale, higher-frequency motions via a two-dimensional forward cascade. The spatial scale for which the inverse and forward cascades intersect is an indication of the spatial scale of the injected vorticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will uncover basic principles of molecular evolution that explain how organisms adapt to environmental changes in the short term and how species adapt to environmental changes in the long term. The project focuses on a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, which is required to extract energy from nutrients. NAD+ levels in cells fluctuate with metabolic conditions, and these fluctuations are sensed by a widespread family of proteins called sirtuins. When NAD+ levels are insufficient, sirtuins allow particular genes to become active, which produces a response that allows the organism to adjust to the low NAD+. This project examines the hypothesis that new responses to low NAD+ stress can arise when new genes come under the control of sirtuins. In addition to advancing the understanding of molecular evolutionary processes, this project will enhance the scientific infrastructure by training the next generation of scientists in three ways. First, the experiments will be conducted by two PhD students. Through their work, the students will learn analytical, laboratory, and computational skills. Second, the project will provide summer research opportunities for four undergraduates. These undergraduates will be introduced to experimental science and discover whether a research career is a good fit. Third, the project will enhance undergraduate education in genetics at the University at Buffalo. The PI will develop interactive teaching modules for an undergraduate genetics course. These activities will increase student engagement and academic success by helping them appreciate the relevance of genetics to their lives and careers. <br/>     <br/>Although scientists have long studied how deacetylation by sirtuins modulates cellular processes, there has been little consideration of the evolutionary implications of changes in sirtuin targets. This project addresses the issue by investigating how the yeast sirtuin-containing complex SUM1C contributes to phenotypic variation and adaptive evolution. SUM1C is composed of a sirtuin deacetylase and a DNA-binding protein that targets the deacetylase to particular genomic locations. The central hypothesis is that SUM1C serves as a rewiring point that allows yeast species to evolve distinct responses to low NAD+ stress by bringing new genes under the control of an NAD+-dependent deacetylase. This project will identify SUM1C target genes in eight phylogenetically distributed yeast species using a combination of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. These data will be used to (i) investigate how SUM1C tunes transcriptional output to intracellular [NAD+] and (ii) determine the functional consequences of changes in the set of SUM1C targets. In so doing, this work will provide new insights into how sirtuin deacetylases, which are broadly conserved across the tree of life, contribute to phenotypic variation in the short term and adaptive evolution in the long-term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigators recently discovered a population of giant bacteria that host dense populations of bacteria within their cells. The investigators will study the community of bacteria associated with the giant bacteria, determine how certain bacteria enter the host cells, and explore the interactions among the intracellular bacteria and the giant host cell.

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.<br/><br/>Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In plants, like in other eukaryotic organisms, the very large genome is packaged into the small space of the cell's nucleus by winding the genomic DNA around proteins to form a compacted DNA-protein complex called chromatin.  Very tightly compacted chromatin can prevent gene expression by mechanisms that are not fully understood.  Exploring these mechanisms is the focus of this proposal.  A long-term goal will be to use the research outcomes to manipulate development in plants to increase their agricultural potential. The research will be carried out by undergraduate and graduate students working together, providing an authentic research experience for undergraduate students and mentoring opportunities for the graduate students. In addition, analysis of the genomic data generated in the project will be incorporated into a new computational genomics course to teach students how to analyze large datasets using computational approaches.  All of the data generated by the project will be deposited in public databases.<br/><br/>In eukaryotes, including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) in nucleosomal chromatin is associated with transcriptional repression, but how this histone modification is imposed, maintained, and read is poorly understood.  The chromatin remodeler named PICKLE (PKL) has been shown previously to promote tissue- and developmental-specific repressive chromatin, defined by the presence of H3K27me3.  Recent evidence suggests that PKL may function as a pre-nucleosome maturation factor that acts with a histone methyltransferase, a second remodeler, and a histone H2A variant to control conditional expression from H3K27me3-enriched loci.  This relationship will be tested by combining genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to relate chromatin-mediated changes in gene expression to whole-plant developmental phenotypes.  The results are expected to reveal the role of H3K27me3 homeostasis in formation and maintenance of repressive chromatin states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As current strawberry varieties are all derived from traditional crossbreeding efforts, they need to be propagated through daughter clones to preserve their unique hybrid combination. These daughter clones, known as runners, are produced from long and hortizontal stems named stolons. However, little is known about how stolon formation is regulated and why strawberry is one of the few plants endowed with the molecular machinery to conduct asexual reproduction through stolon. The experiments are aimed at revealing the molecular mechanisms that underlie this special and highly important developmental trait of strawberry. Further, the project will train next generation scientists in critical thinking, communication, as well as experimental design and execution. Additionally, a professor at the Virginia State University will bring two undergraduate students to the University of Maryland each summer to learn DNA sequence analysis and conduct research. Overall, the project will provide knowledge base and tools to switch on and off stolon, leading to improved strawberry production when stolon formation is switched on or increased fruit yield when stolon formation is turned off. The data generated from the project such as RNA sequence data and network analyses will be easily accessible through websites and public depository; the research materials will be shared with the scientific community. The results will advance basic understanding of plant development and provide novel strategies in the improvement of strawberry productivity. <br/><br/>In strawberry, the interesting mode of asexual reproduction through stolon provides an unusual opportunity to investigate axillary meristem cell fate determination as each axillary meristem either develops into a stolon or a branch crown (a shoot that terminates with flowers). Previous studies using a diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca identified a key signaling component of gibberellin, FveRGA1, as a repressor of stolon formation. The experiments will investigate the mechanism of how FveRGA1 represses stolon formation in F. vesca by first isolating null alleles of FveRGA1 with CRISPR and then characterizing the mutant phenotype. Transcriptome and consensus co-expression networks will identify genes expressed in the axillary meristem that gives rise to stolon. Proteins that directly interact with FveRGA1 in the axillary meristem will be identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation. The role of identified candidate genes in stolon development will be determined using RNAi and over-expression in transgenic F. vesca. Finally, forward genetic approach will be used to map and isolate genes defined by new mutants with altered ability in stolon formation. These experiments will provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of stolon development and illuminate the mechanisms of molecular interaction between the identified genes and FveRGA1 in controling stolon formation. The ablity to suppress stolon production will maximize branch crown formation, leading to more flowers and higher fruit yield. Insights derived from this project will provide knowledge and tools to switch on and off stolon, leading to improved strawberry production and yields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is accomplished through education in sustainability fundamentals followed by deeply embedded learning experiences alongside faculty mentors in Materials Science & Engineering. Students are exposed to sustainability research in the areas of energy, resources, and water taking advantage of the unique geography in Utah. The participants are selected to maximize diversity with an emphasis on Latino, Pacific Islander, and refugee students since these match the high minority populations present in Salt Lake County. A high fraction of participants are contributing to scholarly products such as manuscripts or conference abstracts and presentations. Independent evaluation is being used to monitor continuously and improve effectiveness of this Site. Best practices, lessons learned, and positive outcomes are shared with the broader engineering education community through publications and presentations at the American Society for Engineering Education. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Each participant spends the summer embedded in a research group working with one of 10 participating faculty mentors. Projects involve the development of alternative materials, techniques, and processing routes to achieve more sustainable engineering outcomes in three key subareas: water, energy, and resources. The energy emphasis is placed on replacing critical, toxic, or expensive elements with more sustainable alternatives in order to enable renewable or low-carbon energy technologies. For water, the emphasis is on providing access to clean water through desalination, water purification, and modeling of potential toxins in water and soil. In terms of resources, the emphasis is made on recycling and reducing landfill mass by developing biodegradable packaging and capturing rare metals via recycling of e-waste. In addition to research activities, the participants are also involved in weekly scientific and career-development seminars. All participants present their scientific findings at a symposium at the end of each summer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While all the molecular pathways studied here are present in vertebrate animals including humans, these experiments are conducted in roundworms because they have a compact and defined nervous system, are amenable to genetic manipulation and, in particular, do not have any blood vessels. This makes it possible to avoid confounding effects that changes in vascular development might indirectly have on neural development. Results from this project will advance scientific understanding of nerve cell signaling and plasticity; this research may also identify new genes and molecular pathways important for learning and memory. A complementary outreach plan will develop an instructional research module for use at local public high schools, and a full-semester neurobiology lab course for undergraduates where students have a real opportunity to generate new scientific knowledge that could develop into an independent research project. In the process of performing the proposed research aims, this project will also train graduate students and provide hands-on independent research opportunities for undergraduates, for educators, and for under-represented minorities in a dedicated summer program.<br/><br/>The modulation of synaptic strength via activity-dependent changes in glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance at synapses is a major mechanism underlying learning and memory. While previous work has identified the molecular mechanisms that directly traffic GluRs to and from synapses, less is known about in-vivo secreted factors that act on these receptor trafficking pathways. Preliminary studies from the Principal Investigator?s laboratory have used an optogenetic glutamatergic behavior screen in C. elegans to identify the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) homologs ver-1 and ver-4, which are activated by the secreted VEGF homolog PVF-1. Data also suggest that VER-1 and VER-4, and the ligand PVF-1, regulate both cell surface levels of the GluR GLR-1 and glutamatergic behaviors in C. elegans. The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether regulated secretion of PVF-1/VEGF activates neuronal VER/VEGFR signaling to modulate GLR-1/GluR recycling to the cell surface, thereby impacting behavior. C. elegans is a particularly suitable organism for these studies because of their lack of vasculature, allowing these experiments on the neural effects of VEGFRs to be free of confounds from the vasculature. This work will elucidate the mechanisms by which VER signaling within neurons regulates GLR-1 trafficking, and how PVF-1 expression or secretion are regulated in vivo to modulate GLR-1 abundance and behavior. This study may reveal novel details about the fundamental and conserved mechanisms through which VEGFRs contribute to nervous system function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As part of these reforms, communities are increasingly adopting pretrial risk assessments, tools intended to help judges make fairer, more informed decisions by summarizing an arrestee?s risk of missing a future court date or committing a crime if released. This project will examine how a popular algorithmic risk assessment influences discussions among judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys in hearings in which decisions about bail and pretrial release are made. It will investigate how access to risk assessment reports shapes the questions judges ask and the rationales they offer for their decisions, the arguments prosecutors and defense attorneys advance, and the tone of hearings.

Through qualitative coding and computational text analysis, the study will compare 1) hearings before and after the adoption of the pretrial risk assessment, and 2) following adoption, hearings where risk score reports are provided and hearings where they are not. This analysis will be further enriched with in-person courtroom observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings from this project will contribute to sociological and criminological theory on risk scoring, legal decision-making, and how algorithmic decision aids shape professional practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to achieve greater commercial application, OPVs need to address significant technology challenges in large area device efficiency, stability, and benign/sustainable and safe production. This project will explore scalable, environmentally benign, sustainable and operator-safe ink-based processing methods to produce large scale OPV devices in ambient air conditions. The success of this project will contribute to the transformation of the Nation's energy infrastructure and help transition OPV technology to become a sustainable energy transformation technology that reduces fossil fuel use and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The participating graduate and undergraduate researchers will benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of this project and will gain broad exposure to topics of material science, polymer chemistry, device physics and obtain marketable skills for careers in science and engineering. This work is embedded in the activities of the Organic and Carbon Electronics Laboratory (ORaCEL) at NCSU. Overall, the interdisciplinary nature of the research and its societal significance provides significant opportunities for educational outreach and curriculum development. <br/><br/>The objective of this fundamental research project is to address organic photovoltaic technology needs for environmentally benign processes. This project will fabricate novel high efficiency semi-conducting polymer:non-fullerene based solar cells via blade-coating, a scalable fabrication technique. The OPV active layers will be processed with (a) petrochemical solvents such as anisole, o-methylanisole and THF that are safer and more benign than currently used chlorinated solvents, and (b) renewable, green biosolvents such as limonene, ethanol and potentially water. The molecular engineering needed will be guided by molecular interaction considerations and detailed structure-function-morphology relations. This project involves a multidisciplinary team comprising experts in synthesis (You), miscibility/thermodynamics (Ade), processing (Ade, You, Amassian), in-situ characterization (Amassian), and morphology characterization (Ade, Amassian). The overall strategy will be to provide feedback to the synthesis by validating molecular level guidance from Hansen solubility parameter calculations, miscibility measurements, and in-situ monitoring of morphology development.

Results from the first four years of OSNAP observations have challenged the current understanding of overturning circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.  This grant provides funding for an additional four years of observations in order to deliver to the community a ten-year time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar basin. Variations in these quantities have been invoked to explain changes in a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Arctic Ocean. Thus, by quantifying Atlantic meridional overturning variability and understanding its drivers, OSNAP is providing a critical first step towards addressing societally-relevant, interdisciplinary questions concerning the melting of Greenland ice and Arctic sea-ice, heat content in the Arctic Ocean, climate of the Nordic Seas, and anthropogenic carbon storage. The researchers will actively engage the broader international communities through four workshops, each targeting a societally relevant theme: 1) ocean biogeochemistry and carbon sequestration; 2) overturning in ocean models; 3) Arctic cryosphere; and 4) Nordic Seas variability. Two new postdocs and one graduate student will be supported in this phase of OSNAP and will benefit from the diversity of methodologies and exposure to the large number of OSNAP international scientists. In addition, approximately 20 graduate students from different US and international institutions will receive field training through participation in OSNAP cruises through 2024.<br/><br/>The first four years of data from the OSNAP observing system have shown that the eastern subpolar region, from Greenland to Scotland, dominates the mean meridional mass and heat transport in the subpolar North Atlantic, while more than half of the total meridional freshwater transport occurs across the Labrador basin.  Based on the success of the previous work, this project extends the time series and address the following critical questions: 1. What governs overturning variability in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre on intra-seasonal to interannual time scales? 2. What are the sources of freshwater across the OSNAP section and what governs their variability? 3. What are the impacts of the meridional heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar gyre? Additional motivation for this next phase of OSNAP is provided by the fundamental advancements in our understanding of subpolar North Atlantic dynamics and variability, that will result from the four main U.S. OSNAP mooring arrays, individually and in combination with other OSNAP observations. Further observations are expected to provide a strong observational basis for a new paradigm of overturning in this region, which will include an understanding of the linkage between dense water formation and overturning - a connection present in climate models, yet unobserved to date. Additionally, this this work will further quantify the structure and transport of the upper and deep ocean boundary currents off the east and west coasts of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly notable are the many huge eruptions that produced the Columbia River Basalts (CRB) between 17 and 6 million years ago. The CRB lavas inundated Oregon and Washington, producing thick stacks of lava, in places of thousands of feet or more, and covering in excess of 150,000 square miles. Such voluminous lava outpourings are Earth?s biggest volcanic events and understanding them is key to understanding fundamental aspects of the dynamic behavior of our planet. Lavas of the CRB were fed from fissure eruptions similar to those observed today on Hawaii, Iceland, or at other areas with active basalt volcanism, but much much larger in scale. In recent years, it has become clear the magmas feeding such events can travel long distances laterally underground, instead of vertically from an underlying melt source prior to their eruption. This study will address whether CRB magmas travelled in the subsurface for long distances, and where the magma storage sites were located, to better understand where magmas from the deep Earth interior (> 40 km) ascended to the surface.<br/><br/>This study will combine geochronological, geochemical, and rock magnetic techniques to examine magma flow within Columbia River feeder dikes, and thus will test models of magma transport. Along-strike variations in the age, chemistry, and flow direction in the ~400 km-long Columbia River dike system will be examined to constrain regional-scale magma transport dynamics in the plumbing system of this Large Igneous Province (LIP). This multidisciplinary approach will provide the first dataset of magnetic flow for Columbia River LIP dikes and to supply new and critical constraints on the timing and dynamics of magma emplacement in the province, which are currently lacking. Key questions related to Columbia River LIP magmatism that can be addressed with the new data include: 1) Did Columbia River LIP magmas originate from the inferred inception position of the Yellowstone hotspot at the Nevada-Oregon border? 2) Were there discrete zones of magma storage, from which magma travelled laterally away to feed flood lavas? 3) Over what timescales were dike swarms emplaced, and did the site of magmatism progressively migrate northward away from the Yellowstone hotspot? This project will support graduate and undergraduate students at two institutions, and build an international collaboration with faculty and students at the University of Auckland, NZ. The PI team will also run field workshops for local high school teachers in both Oregon and Washington.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Counting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood can measure cancer progression and evaluate the effectiveness of a cancer treatment.  However, CTCs are highly diversified and only specific CTC subtypes are responsible for cancer metastasis, while current CTC-counting technologies do not distinguish between subpopulations. In this project, CTC subpopulations will be isolated and identified using a microchip containing novel structures (arrangements of posts with different spacings and diameters) that can control local flow patterns.  The different flow patterns enable the capture of subtypes in different chip locations. This chip will permit CTCs to be analyzed where they are captured to ensure that the analyses reflect the true characteristics of these cells. Transformative knowledge obtained from this work will guide application of CTC technologies in assisting cancer diagnosis, predicting tumor progression, and monitoring therapeutic efficacy. If successful, the approach can be adapted to similarly separate subpopulations of immune cells or stem cells for curing cancers or other diseases. The proposed education and outreach plan will enhance the Biomedical Engineering curriculum and program at TTU and introduce undergraduate and graduate students to modern bioengineering techniques. Outreach activities will coordinate with existing TTU programs for junior-high and high school girls and are armed at sparking their interest in science and engineering. In addition, since TTU is a Hispanic Serving Institution, efforts will be made to include more underrepresented minorities into the project.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) through label-free fractionation and profiling of CTC subpopulations. A microchip with hyperuniform structure will be used to isolate, in-situ identify, and selectively separate CTCs. Hyperuniformity (HU) is an emerging concept of a packing pattern that contains local heterogeneity or randomness and global regularity or homogeneity. The concept of hyperuniformity will be integrated into affinity-based microfluidic devices for CTC isolation.  Due to the controlled differences in local flow patterns induced by the hyperuniform structure, cell arrest in different locations on the microchip are expected to require different adhesive strengths. Further, this adhesive strength is anticipated to be related to the types and densities of surface markers on the captured CTCs and therefore, their metastatic character. To maximize capture efficiency, microchip coatings will be modified with tumor specific antibodies.  Separation of individual CTC groups will be achieved by selective degradation of biodegradable nanofilm between the captured cells and the surface of the microposts. In order to correlate of CTC heterogeneity profile with metastatic status, downstream characterization and preliminary in vivo validation will be performed. The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FiRST Objective is to design and characterize HU structured microchip for CTC capture and analyze flow pattern and adhesion force in the device. The local fluidic pattern will be studied through experiments and modeling to determine the potential ""pockets"" where cancer cells accumulate and to correlate the presence of a cell within a given pocket with a characteristic surface adhesion.  The SECOND Objective is to capture and identify subpopulations of single cell and mixed cancer cell lines with variable expression of surface markers using a HU microchip.  A prototype microchip will be used for studying subpopulations in PC3 (human prostate cancer line) with cells with different sizes, culture conditions and cell cycles and for distinguishing subpopulations in mixed prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, and LNCaP (human prostate adenocarcinoma line)). The THIRD Objective is to develop selective release of subpopulations of cancer cells from a HU microchip and perform downstream characterization and preliminary in vivo validation.  Selective release of a captured cancer cell mixture (PC3 and LNCaP) on a HU microchip will be conducted by degrading the nanoflm between cells and micropost surfaces and controlled local mechanical agitation. To study the progression of metastasis, a primary human prostrate cancel cell line (CP3TX), will be transplanted into the femurs of mice and blood samples will be collected at different time points and run through HU microchips to capture CTCs that can be used as metastasis indicators.  Indicator profiles are expected to correlate with prostate cancer metastasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further improvements in the performance and stability of these materials and devices will help enable mechanically flexible, lightweight, and inexpensive solar cells and LEDs that may be used in disaster relief areas, in military applications, and broadly deployed to help create a more secure and sustainable energy future. In both solar cells and LEDs, the HP is sandwiched between charge-transporting layers that serve to remove or inject charge carriers (either holes or electrons) into the HP.  Interfaces between the HP and these transporting layers are the dominant areas where harmful non-radiative recombination processes occur, which can lower light generation efficiency and increase heat loss.  Thus, it is essential to better understand these interfaces and identify means to reduce interfacial recombination rates.  This research will directly probe recombination rates at HP interfaces with various transport layers using transient reflectance spectroscopy through a collaboration with Dr. Matthew Beard at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The Graham group has worked extensively on understanding and manipulating the surface chemistry of HPs.  Through this grant, the Graham group will be able to directly probe how changes in surface chemistry impact interfacial charge recombination rates.  The findings of this research will help accelerate the development of HPs for solar cells and LEDs, while the collaboration with NREL will help transfer knowledge from the nation's premier renewable energy research facility to researchers in Kentucky.  <br/><br/>Charge-transfer processes at interfaces are one of the most relevant processes determining the performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices, yet these interfacial processes remain much less understood than those occurring within the bulk of the materials.  The goal of this proposed research is to use HPs as a platform to characterize how energetics and electronic coupling influence interfacial recombination processes through the application of transient reflectance spectroscopy. Transient reflectance relies on ultrafast laser pulses to monitor charge carrier recombination dynamics specifically at interfaces, thereby providing a powerful tool to differentiate interfacial recombination from recombination occurring within the bulk of the HP.  Ultimately, the research will test the hypothesis that interfacial recombination rates can be significantly reduced through manipulating the interfacial energy landscape and electronic coupling at interfaces between dissimilar materials using surface modifiers.  Previous research has investigated surface and bulk recombination in pure HPs in both single crystal and polycrystalline film formats, but these investigations have not been extended to include the presence of charge transport layers.  Recombination rates have also been investigated within completed PV devices, but in these complete devices it is not possible to identify where recombination is occurring; thus, targeted approaches to reduce recombination are hindered.  In this proposed research the principal investigator and a graduate student will work with Dr. Beard at NREL on applying transient reflectance spectroscopy to directly probe recombination rates at these important interfaces.  Combining these transient reflectance measurements with ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy will uncover how interfacial energetics and electronic coupling impact interfacial recombination, thereby helping to guide the development of improved solar cells and LEDs based on HPs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project asks: Are women who are perceived to be social minorities discriminated against when applying to jobs in the United States? Does the effect of being a social minority differ for white and black women? Does the gender composition of the job, or the personality traits employers seek, affect whether social minorities are disadvantaged? If so, do these patterns differ by race? And lastly, what are some mechanisms behind disadvantaging or favoring social minorities compared to majorities in the labor market? This research is especially pertinent because labor market inequalities between social minority and majority men have been well-documented both theoretically and empirically, but there is less consensus on whether female social minorities experience workplace penalties compared to majority women. Analyzing how workplace bias against social minorities may vary by different contextual or demographic factors can not only help shed light on long-term psychological effects and economic disadvantages that such employees face, but it can also influence public policies designed to bring about greater equality for all individuals in the U.S. labor market.<br/><br/>The project consists of two experiments. First, the project implements a large-scale rsum audit study that includes job applications to over 3,000 jobs across 6 states using 4 fictitious rsums that vary by race and social minority status. This study will obtain an estimate of whether and to what extent social minorities experience penalties compared to majority women, where the applications also vary by race, at the first point of contact with an employer. Next, the project conducts a survey experiment that recruits 1,500 hiring managers and asks them to rate the same fictitious women?s rsums on various traits, such as perceived competence, morality, professionalism, and masculinity. This experiment supplements the rsum audit study data in that it helps to illuminate the mechanisms behind disfavoring?or favoring?social minorities compared to majority women, who also vary by race, regarding labor market outcomes. These findings will inform sociological theories regarding the operation of the labor market, particularly regarding the varying experiences that women who vary by social status experience throughout the job application process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We know that the majority of urban home-seekers in the United States now use the internet as their primary source to find new places to live. Despite this development, we  know relatively little regarding how renters select their housing at a time when information about available housing is increasingly moving online.  While this technological transformation has largely gone unexamined, some prior research shows that advertisements for rental housing are not all the same; rather, they differ systematically depending on the demographics of the neighborhood where the housing being advertised is located. This project analyzes rental housing advertisements posted online to investigate if these differences matter for people during their housing search. Understanding how individuals interpret the information they see in the online housing market is key to explaining why people move to certain places and not others, which has implications for the future of residential inequality and racial/ethnic segregation. The findings will advance understanding of residential selection processes and aid policy makers looking to expand and equalize access to information for home-seekers, with implications for improved social and economic well-being in urban areas. <br/><br/>Given the role that online rental advertisement plays in promoting neighborhood composition, it is notable that we know so little regarding how individuals interpret this information.  Using natural language processing to analyze millions of advertisements for rental housing in the 50 largest U.S. cities posted on Craigslist, prior work has identified patterns in the distribution of different types of information in neighborhoods that vary by race/ethnicity and poverty rate. This proposal will use this information to test the causal effects of these real-world differences in the ways units are advertised on individuals? housing and neighborhood preferences in five large urban areas: Los Angeles, SF-Bay Area, New York City, Chicago, and Houston.  The project will implement three survey experiments in each area to test how online advertisements shape housing decisions and residents? perceptions of local neighborhoods. The project will compare the effects of information in housing ads and perceptions of neighborhoods to the effects of other kinds of information, including neighborhood demographic data, on individuals? interest in housing units. Selection of these five large areas allows the project to oversample Black, Latino and Asian minority respondents. Each survey experiment will first be constructed to be representative of the urban area (n=1,000/area), but will then collect additional respondents from specific minority population(s) within each area: oversamples of 100-300 additional Asian respondents in the SF Bay Area; Black respondents in New York and Chicago; and Latino respondents (including Spanish-speakers) in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. By using representative surveys of specific urban areas with oversamples of minority residents, the project will analyze?through a combination of difference of means tests and multiple regression models?how reactions to housing advertisements vary across ethno-racial groups.

The project addresses open questions in solar physics about how the solar wind is energized, and in general, about how astrophysical plasmas are heated due to particle interactions with magnetic fields. This work is important as the vast majority of visible mass in the universe is expected to be in the plasma state, in which atoms are broken up into electrons and ions that are strongly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. The study is particularly timely to interpret forthcoming observations from the Parker Solar Probe. In addition to doing cutting-edge research, the principal investigator (PI) will also mentor a summer student?s research project and develop an undergraduate educational module on space physics, which will contribute toward her professional development.<br/><br/>Microinstabilities are known to play a large role in the energy transfer and evolution of astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind. Most descriptions of the evolution and onset of microinstabilities only include linear terms, ignoring nonlinear effects. However, the onset and evolution of many of these instabilities is highly dependent on non-thermal features of the particle velocity distribution function, in particular, regions of trapped particles in finite amplitude magnetic fields. The primary questions to be investigated in this postdoctoral study are (i) the extent to which nonlinear effects, such as trapped and passing particles, affect the onset and evolution of microinstabilities in the solar plasma, and (ii) the parameter regimes where the nonlinearities need to be taken into account. The project will develop an analytical model for the evolution and onset of the instabilities, drawing on quasilinear theory and the PI?s thesis work on trapped and passing particles. The analytical model will be validated using kinetic simulations in conjunction with a statistical analysis of fluctuations observed in the solar wind.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will mentor an REU student?s research project at the University of Arizona and develop an educational module to introduce undergraduates to current research questions in space science and plasma physics.

However, no major efforts have been made to understand tropical sea anemone diversity since the advent of modern DNA sequencing. Compounding a lack of research, sea anemones have few physical characteristics that are useful for discerning between species and classic DNA sequencing approaches have been ineffective for discovering new taxa. Thus, it is likely that tropical sea anemone diversity is vastly underdescribed, and new genomic approaches are needed to simultaneously discover species, place them into broader evolutionary context, and determine what physical sea anemone characteristics are informative at every taxonomic level. This study will explore the evolutionary processes that have given rise to tropical sea anemone diversity by focusing on the clownfish-hosting sea anemones. The clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis has been a model for exploring fundamental biological processes, but prior research has focused almost exclusively on clownfish. The presence of undescribed sea anemone hosts will re-write our understanding of the clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis, shed light on the origin of tropical anemone diversity, and transform the interpretation of dozens of studies across scientific disciplines. This research will result in modern natural history collection resources for tropical sea anemone diversity. Outreach and educational opportunities for undergraduate students and the general public will take place at the American Museum of Natural History. Citizen science initiatives will result in the formation of the first long-term data platform to track the distribution and abundance of the clownfish sea anemones. Updated sea anemone species descriptions will be valuable for establishing scientifically-based conservation initiatives in the ornamental aquarium trade.<br/><br/>Researchers will conduct major field research collecting expeditions to Madagascar, Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Marshall Islands. All individual sea anemones sampled in this study will be photographed underwater. Resulting images and ecological metadata will be uploaded to public digital biodiversity databases. New sea anemone species will be discovered using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and newly developed bait-capture probes for Class Anthozoa targeting Ultra Conserved Element loci. Resulting genomic data will be used for testing three key questions regarding tropical sea anemone diversity and the clownfish-sea anemone symbiosis: 1) What is the true species-level diversity of the clownfish-hosting sea anemones? 2) Do host sea anemones share a common biogeographic origin with clownfishes? 3) Are the tropics a center or origin, or accumulation, of sea anemone biodiversity? These data, which will be shared in public repositories, will provide the first comparative genomic systematic study on tropical sea anemone diversity, the clownfish-hosting sea anemones, and the anemone superfamily Actinioidea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. <br/><br/>PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events represent the intersection of geologic processes that proceed over thousands to millions of years and destabilization of the volcanic reservoir which may occur rapidly over only days to years. These processes may be interrogated through retrospective geologic studies of past eruptions and geophysical monitoring, respectively. This project is focused on integrating these approaches at the Three Sisters Volcanic Complex, a ?very high threat potential? volcanic system located in the western United States. The goals are to elucidate hazards specific to the Three Sisters through the investigation of recent eruptions and volcanic unrest and produce new conceptual and quantitative models that can be applied to understand the hazards and improve eruption forecasting for active volcanoes globally. The results of this project will be disseminated to the general public through animation and videos published on-line and a self-guided geology hiking guide made available to the many recreational visitors to the Three Sister?s Wilderness Area.<br/><br/>Linking the processes that catalyze the growth, evolution, destabilization, and eruption of magma reservoirs to their expression as observable unrest represents an important scientific frontier that requires inter-disciplinary collaborations across the geosciences. Parallel advances in geophysics, petrochronology, and numerical modeling have made substantial contributions to the understanding of magma reservoir processes. Yet, these methods remain poorly integrated. The unusual confluence of frequent late Pleistocene to late Holocene eruptions, which range in composition from basaltic andesite to rhyolite, with modern volcanic unrest make the Three Sisters a prime natural laboratory at which to pursue this integrated approach. This project will produce new crystal-scale petrochronologic data for lavas and associated explosive products erupted from the Three Sisters Volcanic Complex, central Oregon Cascades, during the last ca. 50,000 yr. These data will inform interpretations of: 1) the petrogenesis of the rhyolite and dacite lavas erupted at the Three Sisters and if there is a genetic relationship between these rock types; 2) the longevity and physical integration of the magma reservoir(s) that produced the late Pleistocene flare-up of intermediate and silicic volcanism; and 3) the nature and tempo of the processes that preceded, and potentially triggered, these eruptions. In parallel, a high-resolution Bouguer gravity survey will be conducted to constrain the physical structure of the modern magma reservoir. These new geochemical and geophysical data will be integrated with the existing geodetic observations of recent uplift in coupled models of magma dynamics and crustal deformation. Accordingly, these observations and models will quantitatively test if recent unrest at Three Sisters reflects similar processes to those associated with the late-Pleistocene volcanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from the first four years of OSNAP observations have challenged the current understanding of overturning circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.  This grant provides funding for an additional four years of observations in order to deliver to the community a ten-year time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar basin. Variations in these quantities have been invoked to explain changes in a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Arctic Ocean. Thus, by quantifying Atlantic meridional overturning variability and understanding its drivers, OSNAP is providing a critical first step towards addressing societally-relevant, interdisciplinary questions concerning the melting of Greenland ice and Arctic sea-ice, heat content in the Arctic Ocean, climate of the Nordic Seas, and anthropogenic carbon storage. The researchers will actively engage the broader international communities through four workshops, each targeting a societally relevant theme: 1) ocean biogeochemistry and carbon sequestration; 2) overturning in ocean models; 3) Arctic cryosphere; and 4) Nordic Seas variability. Two new postdocs and one graduate student will be supported in this phase of OSNAP and will benefit from the diversity of methodologies and exposure to the large number of OSNAP international scientists. In addition, approximately 20 graduate students from different US and international institutions will receive field training through participation in OSNAP cruises through 2024.<br/><br/>The first four years of data from the OSNAP observing system have shown that the eastern subpolar region, from Greenland to Scotland, dominates the mean meridional mass and heat transport in the subpolar North Atlantic, while more than half of the total meridional freshwater transport occurs across the Labrador basin.  Based on the success of the previous work, this project extends the time series and address the following critical questions: 1. What governs overturning variability in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre on intra-seasonal to interannual time scales? 2. What are the sources of freshwater across the OSNAP section and what governs their variability? 3. What are the impacts of the meridional heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar gyre? Additional motivation for this next phase of OSNAP is provided by the fundamental advancements in our understanding of subpolar North Atlantic dynamics and variability, that will result from the four main U.S. OSNAP mooring arrays, individually and in combination with other OSNAP observations. Further observations are expected to provide a strong observational basis for a new paradigm of overturning in this region, which will include an understanding of the linkage between dense water formation and overturning - a connection present in climate models, yet unobserved to date. Additionally, this this work will further quantify the structure and transport of the upper and deep ocean boundary currents off the east and west coasts of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We know that the majority of urban home-seekers in the United States now use the internet as their primary source to find new places to live. Despite this development, we  know relatively little regarding how renters select their housing at a time when information about available housing is increasingly moving online.  While this technological transformation has largely gone unexamined, some prior research shows that advertisements for rental housing are not all the same; rather, they differ systematically depending on the demographics of the neighborhood where the housing being advertised is located. This project analyzes rental housing advertisements posted online to investigate if these differences matter for people during their housing search. Understanding how individuals interpret the information they see in the online housing market is key to explaining why people move to certain places and not others, which has implications for the future of residential inequality and racial/ethnic segregation. The findings will advance understanding of residential selection processes and aid policy makers looking to expand and equalize access to information for home-seekers, with implications for improved social and economic well-being in urban areas. <br/><br/>Given the role that online rental advertisement plays in promoting neighborhood composition, it is notable that we know so little regarding how individuals interpret this information.  Using natural language processing to analyze millions of advertisements for rental housing in the 50 largest U.S. cities posted on Craigslist, prior work has identified patterns in the distribution of different types of information in neighborhoods that vary by race/ethnicity and poverty rate. This proposal will use this information to test the causal effects of these real-world differences in the ways units are advertised on individuals? housing and neighborhood preferences in five large urban areas: Los Angeles, SF-Bay Area, New York City, Chicago, and Houston.  The project will implement three survey experiments in each area to test how online advertisements shape housing decisions and residents? perceptions of local neighborhoods. The project will compare the effects of information in housing ads and perceptions of neighborhoods to the effects of other kinds of information, including neighborhood demographic data, on individuals? interest in housing units. Selection of these five large areas allows the project to oversample Black, Latino and Asian minority respondents. Each survey experiment will first be constructed to be representative of the urban area (n=1,000/area), but will then collect additional respondents from specific minority population(s) within each area: oversamples of 100-300 additional Asian respondents in the SF Bay Area; Black respondents in New York and Chicago; and Latino respondents (including Spanish-speakers) in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. By using representative surveys of specific urban areas with oversamples of minority residents, the project will analyze?through a combination of difference of means tests and multiple regression models?how reactions to housing advertisements vary across ethno-racial groups.  The project will contribute to sociological theory regarding neighborhood and unit selection processes, residential sorting, the formation of place reputations, and how prospective tenants form impressions of their residential contexts. The project also will help to transform how survey experiments are developed and implemented across the social sciences by demonstrating the utility of big data sources and computational techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen production from water splitting has the potential to address many of these challenges. However, high material costs, low efficiency, and poor durability constitute major barriers to industrial and residential applications. The proposed hydrogen production technology in this project will overcome these barriers by significantly decreasing the amount of noble metals in the catalysts.

The makeup of this scientific workforce is known to shape what scientific discoveries are made, and its social structure is complex, evolving, and increasingly interdisciplinary. However, inequalities within science are both pervasive and persistent, and these appear across both the individual and organizational levels of the academy. The ""new synthesis"" this workshop aims to produce will help align a diverse set of research communities toward specific questions related to the causes and consequences of social and epistemic inequalities in the production of knowledge. A likely outcome of the workshop is writing a collective agenda-setting perspective piece that presents these ideas to the broader community, which will also help guide policy makers and funders as to what is known and unknown about the casual structures that limit scientific progress. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary workshop will bring together experts from a diverse set of communities to engage specific questions of identifying, debating, and developing evidence-based policies that resolve genuine inequalities of opportunity in science, in order to increase the pace and diversity of scientific discoveries. Progress in this direction requires developing a new synthesis in the area of the ""science of science,"" to specifically develop a causal understanding of the social, competitive, and structural factors that drive these inequalities and make them so persistent. The complex and dynamic structure of the ecosystem of scientists, organizations, and incentives has inhibited past efforts to unravel this causal structure. By convening a diverse set of accomplished scholars all studying the science of science from different perspectives, this workshop seeks to formulate a new and integrated vision for how interdisciplinary research, in combination with modern digital infrastructure (including bibliographic databases, digital censuses of fields, and the powerful tools of causal inference and machine learning), can break through the past barriers to create a genuinely scientific understanding of the scientific ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research aims to enable broadly applicable methods of visualizing dynamic motions of proteins and other biomolecules in solution at physiological temperature. The education plan integrates undergraduate and PhD students into the specific research project, as well as the broader initiative to develop ultrafast x-ray science at ASU. Opportunities are tailored to undergraduate first-generation community college transfer students to engage in mentored independent research at ASU. A team of undergraduate and PhD students will work together toward complementary research goals and will travel to large-scale laboratory facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National lab, to learn how diverse teams of scientists work together. Student career development will be supported through cross-training opportunities at collaborator institutes, participation in international conferences, assistance with individual development plans, and other forms of mentorship. A new freely available open-source software suite will be developed as a pedagogical tool to help a broader audience of students master x-ray data analysis methods and explore new imaging concepts. A complementary optical diffractive imaging laboratory apparatus will be developed to teach experimental techniques. These hardware and software tools will be integrated into undergraduate physics curriculum at ASU and will also provide a foundation for an interactive diffractive x-ray imaging display to be showcased at public outreach events at ASU. The educational plans are highly synergistic with the existing NSF BioXFEL Science and Technology Center and the Compact X-Ray Light Source facility at ASU?s Biodesign Institute.<br/><br/>The scientific research targets the general need for measurement techniques that can reveal detailed three- dimensional structures and functional dynamics of biomolecules such as proteins. It develops x-ray scattering methods to determine structures without the need to grow macroscopic protein crystals or to cryogenically freeze samples, both of which are requirements of existing techniques that can limit their effectiveness for dynamic molecules. X-ray free-electron lasers are used to produce snapshot scattering patterns by outrunning atomic motions with intense ultrashort x-ray pulses of just 10 femtoseconds (10-14 seconds). Unlike conventional x-ray solution scattering, the analysis of two-point intensity correlations amongst snapshot scattering patterns can directly yield three-dimensional structures, and in favorable cases allows for chemically selective  imaging  of  atomic  sub-structures  embedded  in  complex environments. Structural changes may be sequenced in time to form ?molecular movies? by delaying snapshots until shortly after reactions are triggered with light flashes, temperature jumps, or by other mechanisms. These methods are applicable to a broad variety of biomolecular systems which includes, among numerous examples, proteins that are involved in photosynthesis, vision, viral infection, and signaling processes that regulate nearly all vital processes in living cells and organisms. Model protein systems studied in the course of this research will elucidate ultrafast dynamics of light-activated protein motions. In addition to the publication of results in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences, x-ray scattering data and analysis software will be made publicly available and will contribute to the general development of ultrafast x-ray imaging science. Similarly, innovative hardware technologies developed in the course of the research, such as micro-nozzle designs for the production of liquid nanodroplets, will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The value proposition of this project is to present a non-invasive continuous pulmonary function monitor for persons with an acute or chronic respiratory illness to self-manage, monitor, or prevent exacerbations of their illness. This monitor would be implemented as a stretchable, wearable sensor that estimates changes in the size of the ribcage from breathing.

Currently, lung function testing, spirometry, capnometry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and pulse oximetry are the clinical standard for vital monitoring and assessing lung function. Until now, respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which requires two bands ? a chest-worn and abdomen worn band, is the least invasive technology for tidal volume monitoring. Pulse oximetry is an inferior technology for the early detection of respiratory distress (or colloquially, shortness of breath) because changes in oxygenation take time. In contrast, for example, respiratory depression can be quickly detected by changes in tidal volume. However, capnography and respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which are capable of monitoring tidal volume, are cumbersome and ill-suited for use outside a clinical setting.New evidence has now demonstrated that by measuring the change in circumference of the ribcage, you can estimate tidal volume with high fidelity using a stretchable sensor capable of confirming to the body. Integrating this sensor technology into a wearable device with a wireless sensor module has the potential to unlock new avenues for telehealth monitoring and delivery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These issues have come to the forefront in the Midwestern United States where there is a tension to both enhance food production and protect ecosystem services. Decisions across this largely agricultural landscape influence downstream water quality in both the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. On-farm conservation practices are one way to combat the environmental issues associated with agricultural production. However, using these practices involves a farmer accepting some level of risk and uncertainty in the short-term to achieve long-term on-farm benefits; a challenge that is further exacerbated by factors like climate change and commodity market fluctuations. Despite large investments to encourage landowner conservation use, adoption of conservation practices on private lands remains relatively low and stagnant over time. This dissertation research seeks to better understand the likelihood of engaging in conservation practices on private lands through the theoretical framework of scarcity by asking the question: Is engagement hindered by annual seasonal cycles that limit a farmer?s ability to follow through on commitments to conservation?<br/><br/>Despite substantial research examining farmer conservation decision-making, many commonly examined predictors have low explanatory power. Moreover, there is a continued gap between farmer conservation use intentions, which tend to be high, and actual conservation behavior over time, which tends to be low. In response to these challenges, there is a need for a broader perspective that more explicitly considers the context in which farmer decisions are made, and may prevent a well-intentioned individual from following through on those intentions. This research project fills this gap by assessing the role of financial and temporal scarcity in farmer decision making. Scarcity can cause a reduction in cognitive function that leads to altered decision making. This project seeks to determine if financial or temporal scarcity is a salient issue for farmers and to evaluate if scarcity impacts distinct groups of farmers in different ways. The work connects scarcity to conservation decisions by examining the effect of seasonal scarcity on cover crop adoption, a particularly risky, uncertain, and complex practice. The research team recruits farmers to participate in interviews and a cognitive task at three times throughout the year to understand their experience of scarcity and their use and perceptions of conservation practices (e.g., cover crops). Hypotheses are that farmers with larger operations and off-farm income are less likely to be impacted by seasonal scarcity and that those farmers experiencing seasonal scarcity will be less likely to use cover crops. The research advances our theoretical understanding of conservation decision making on private lands, while improving our understanding of scarcity by applying it in a new setting and with a new behavior. Importantly, this work shifts the current farmer conservation narrative away from a narrow focus on personal-level attributes to a broader exploration of how such factors may interact with contextual-level factors including scarcity and the seasonality of agriculture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One emerging application of these algorithms is as an aid in determining the priority for (human) image review of a patient with an abnormal condition. Since 2018, the FDA has approved several of these ML-aided triage devices. The patient/case-level output of these algorithms does not replace the interpretation by a radiologist but it can inform the radiologist's prioritization of case reviews and hence the radiologist's workflow. On one hand, such ML algorithms can lead to better patient outcomes by increasing the likelihood for earlier diagnosis and treatment of severe and time-sensitive conditions. On the other hand, the radiologist?s re-prioritization of work can delay the review of cases that are incorrectly analyzed and missed or those not in the scope of the ML algorithm. While the algorithms typically process the images in minutes, the overall, risk-adjusted, patient waiting time-saving benefits are difficult to discern due to the complexity of the clinician's workflow. <br/><br/>To improve the understanding of the interplay between the ML-aided triage and the workflow into which it feeds, this project develops flexible analytical and simulation models which accommodate various ML-aided triage algorithms and workflow management rules in clinical reading. The aim of the research is to provide regulators with a quantitative principled approach to evaluate, in a workflow-relevant way, the prioritization performance of these triage algorithms. The results of this project will enable developers to identify optimal prioritization strategies, and let users have science-based information about these devices so that they can make informed health care decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale data-storage systems---systems that store data in a durable and accessible manner---are thus a critical infrastructure component serving as the backbone for Internet based services. The devices on which data is stored in these systems often fail. To ensure that data is not lost when devices fail, storage systems store data in a redundant fashion. This added redundancy consumes additional storage space and thus directly translates to an increase in the consumption of resources and energy. The amount of redundancy is configured based on the failure rates of storage devices. These failure rates have been observed to vary significantly over time, and hence dynamically adapting the redundancy level to observed failure rates provides an opportunity for significant storage space savings. Conventional redundancy adaptation in today's storage systems, however, consumes prohibitively high amount of resources. This project will develop a theoretical framework to study redundancy adaptation in storage systems, establish the fundamental limits on resource overhead, and design practical algorithms to enable efficient redundancy adaptation. By addressing the foundational and algorithmic questions related to the resource, cost and energy efficiency of storage systems, the project directly contributes to ensuring the scalability and sustainability of data infrastructure. This project will also have significant educational and outreach impact via course modules for graduate and undergraduate students, specially designed modules for K-12 students and teachers, and tutorials at conferences for researchers and industry practitioners. Directed efforts will be undertaken for promoting diversity in STEM education and in mentoring undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Large-scale storage systems typically employ erasure codes for adding redundancy. While adapting redundancy to observed failure rates has been shown to be promising, such adaptation in erasure-coded storage systems require converting already encoded data from one code to another. Such code conversion under traditional codes consume prohibitively large amounts of cluster resources such as accesses, disk I/O, and network bandwidth. The overarching goal of this project is to develop information- and coding-theoretic tools and principles for resource and energy efficiency in data centers via redundancy adaptation, along with educational and outreach efforts centered around big-data systems. Specifically, the project aims to (1) design an information-theoretic framework to study code conversion, (2) establish fundamental limits on associated resource overhead, and (3) develop a unified theory for storage codes to design practical codes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most recent such earthquake occurred on January 26th, 1700, and GPS data acquired during the last two decades suggest that strain is accumulating across the subduction zone fault in preparation for a future earthquake. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how the geologic structure of the subduction zone will impact strain release during a Cascadia earthquake. Different plausible earthquake scenarios result in quite different predicted ground shaking, which in turn influences building codes and emergency response plans. This project will image the structure of the crust in the region where large Cascadia earthquakes are thought to occur. The objective is to understand three-dimensional variations in seismic velocity in order to provide insights into the factors that control segmentation of slip during earthquakes and the resulting amplitude of ground shaking in populated areas and sedimentary basins. With its large footprint and involvement of many field hands, this project will provide student research experiences and opportunities for public outreach and education about geohazards in the Pacific Northwest. This project is a collaboration between Oregon State University, University of Oregon, Eugene, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the U.S. Geological Survey.<br/><br/>This project has the ultimate goal of generating a high-resolution model of an active subduction system that will span the Cascadia plate boundary, including the transition between major along-strike segments, and cross the transition from the nominally locked zone down-dip to depths where plate motion is accommodated by episodic tremor and slip. A dense network of temporary short-period seismometers along the coast of the Pacific Northwest will extend high resolution imaging of the structure of the overlying and down-going plates, as well as the thickness and characteristics of material within the plate interface zone, to depths that are critical for understanding earthquake processes. The array design includes a single deployment of three-component instruments at 1-km intervals along the onshore extension of dip lines embedded within a sparser grid of seismometers spaced 7-10 km apart for a total of ~700 three-component seismic stations. To tie results from the seismogenic part of the plate boundary to larger-scale forearc and arc structure, two profiles will extend across the forearc. All stations will record natural sources as well as man-made sources for the duration of the deployment. The seismic data from this experiment will be made immediately available to the community. The resulting high-resolution 3D Vp model will also be made accessible and is critical for constraining analyses of seismic noise, magnetotelluric and potential field data, as well as for improving predictions of earthquake ground shaking and tsunami generation in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been hypothesized that the effects of drought are especially severe for populations found in the fragments of habitat that remain following deforestation. This is thought to be especially true for plant species in biodiversity rich tropical forests, which are often especially sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. The research team will use a long-term dataset on plant growth, reproduction, and mortality collected in the Central Amazon to determine how droughts influence the risk of plant extinction in rain forest fragments. In addition to answering an important unresolved ecological question, the results will help those tasked with managing biologically, socially, and economically critical forest ecosystems for a future in which droughts are predicted to become more frequent or intense. In doing so the investigators will be training early-career scientists in advanced statistics and mathematical modeling, making several ecologically valuable datasets publicly available, and curating an art museum exhibit about rain forests and their global importance to society.   <br/><br/>To determine how droughts and deforestation interact to increase the risk that plant populations will go extinct, the researchers will use previously collected data on the growth, reproduction, and mortality of thousands of individuals of a plant species from the central Amazon: the understory herb Heliconia acmuniata. These data were collected in both unbroken rain forest and experimentally isolated forest fragments near the city of Manaus, Brazil. The researchers will first use four decades of data on rainfall in the region to identify drought years and categorize drought intensity. They will then compare plant growth, reproduction, and mortality before and after droughts, as well as how long after droughts any differences can be detected. Finally, these statistical analyses, along with the analysis of drought frequency, will be used to calibrate mathematical models with which they will simulate future population sizes under alternative drought scenarios predicted for the Amazon. The results of these simulations will indicate if the probability that populations will go extinct because of drought is greater in unbroken rain forest or forest fragments, and if this probability changes when droughts are more frequent or severe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the ocean cools, oxygen and carbon dioxide are mixed from the atmosphere into a thick layer of water that ultimately spreads southward to fill a large volume of the North Atlantic and beyond.  The presence of this water mass prevents the North Atlantic anywhere from becoming completely devoid of oxygen.  Vertical mixing in the Labrador Sea also redistributes carbon dioxide into the deep ocean, where it can remain for hundreds of years, preventing it from contributing to the greenhouse effect.  Yet, the processes governing the uptake of gases by the ocean are not well understood or quantified.  Given that, over the last century, the ocean has become steadily more depleted in oxygen while also absorbing a large fraction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, observing gas exchange processes is essential for understanding and predicting the evolution of the ocean and climate system. The circulation of the Labrador Sea has been monitored since 2014 with an array of instrumented cables extending from the seafloor to nearly the ocean surface.  This project adds gas sensors to this array to investigate the rates and processes governing gas exchange. Through this project, a student and postdoc will be trained in interdisciplinary oceanography with a rich network of international collaborators.  Responding to the need to increase public ocean literacy, the project scientists will work with University of Rhode Island?s Inner Space Center to broadcast live, interactive science sessions to educators at partner high schools and will follow-up with in-person science cafs at three participating schools.<br/><br/>Given the unique role of the Labrador Sea in providing a pathway for oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to enter the intermediate depths of the ocean, a quantification and mechanistic understanding of the gas uptake and transport in the basin is a leading scientific priority. Oxygenation of Labrador Sea water prevents large-scale hypoxia from developing anywhere in the Atlantic Ocean and anthropogenic CO2 storage in the basin is the highest in the global ocean. The assumption that, in the Atlantic Ocean, O2 and CO2 uptake and their variability are tied to the dynamics of heat loss and the overturning circulation pervades the literature but has never been evaluated on the basis of direct observations. Thus, GOHSNAP (Gases in the Overturning and Horizontal circulation of the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) addresses this gap and the urgent need to better understand interactions between gas uptake, transport, and the overturning circulation. Specifically, this program will provide a continuous 2-year record of the trans-basin, full water column transport of O2 across the southern boundary of the Labrador Sea, leveraging the mooring infrastructure of the US-lead, international Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). The addition of O2 sensors at various depths on this array, supplemented by observations collected by autonomous platforms will allow for the quantification of O2 export from the Labrador Sea.  The data will further be used to empirically model carbon concentrations and estimate carbon export. Proposed instruments will also measure the mixed layer O2 and pCO2 for two winters, from which air-sea gas exchange will be calculated and compared against analogous observations in the convective interior of the Labrador Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These outbreaks impacting food security are a major societal concern. To manage disease outbreaks, understanding various mechanisms employed by diverse pathogenic species to infect a common host or, at times, to acquire infectivity on a new host is crucial. While molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis on a given host have been uncovered in individual pathogenic species, understanding whether these mechanisms are conserved across diverse species infecting common host remains elusive. The goals of this project are to 1) understand various mechanisms that diverse pathogenic bacteria use to specialize on a common host, 2) identify traits that allow pathogenic bacteria to acquire infectivity on a new host. This knowledge will help resolve complex interactions between plants and pathogens and foster development of effective strategies to respond and manage pathogen populations. The educational goals include fostering STEM research interests by providing research opportunities for high-school students from high-need schools in Alabama and first-generation minority undergraduate students, and raising public knowledge of emergence of plant disease outbreaks, their influence on plant health and, ultimately, on our lives. The project will educate students on what makes bacterium pathogenic and how diseases emerge in the modern era of agriculture. <br/><br/>Conceptualizing host range of plant pathogenic bacteria has been a challenge. Population genomics, association analyses, and transcriptomics approaches have proposed a new paradigm stating host range as an overlapping genetic continuum involving multiple genetic determinants with small to major effect. However, functional validation of the select candidates has not been sufficient to uncover the basis of host range.  Using Xanthomonas species complex as a model system where both pathological convergence as well as recent host range expansion have been observed, the project will test the idea that host range determinants are not restricted to the pathogenic phase, but asymptomatic early phase is equally important in determining overall dynamics of essential pathogenicity determinants.  Deploying forward and reverse bacterial genetics, pathogen transcriptomics, experimental evolution and high-throughput sequencing tools, the project will test the following hypotheses; i) functionally conserved essential determinants from diverse pathogen species are involved in the infection of a common host causing the same disease, although their temporal dynamics may vary depending on contribution of other variable fitness determinants; ii) genetic exchange of adaptive traits in closely related species under host selection pressure and in presence of competing species is responsible for host range expansion. The project will identify genetic determinants during infection process that govern qualitative and quantitative differences across different pathogenic species.

As the ocean cools, oxygen and carbon dioxide are mixed from the atmosphere into a thick layer of water that ultimately spreads southward to fill a large volume of the North Atlantic and beyond.  The presence of this water mass prevents the North Atlantic anywhere from becoming completely devoid of oxygen.  Vertical mixing in the Labrador Sea also redistributes carbon dioxide into the deep ocean, where it can remain for hundreds of years, preventing it from contributing to the greenhouse effect.  Yet, the processes governing the uptake of gases by the ocean are not well understood or quantified.  Given that, over the last century, the ocean has become steadily more depleted in oxygen while also absorbing a large fraction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, observing gas exchange processes is essential for understanding and predicting the evolution of the ocean and climate system. The circulation of the Labrador Sea has been monitored since 2014 with an array of instrumented cables extending from the seafloor to nearly the ocean surface.  This project adds gas sensors to this array to investigate the rates and processes governing gas exchange. Through this project, a student and postdoc will be trained in interdisciplinary oceanography with a rich network of international collaborators.  Responding to the need to increase public ocean literacy, the project scientists will work with University of Rhode Island?s Inner Space Center to broadcast live, interactive science sessions to educators at partner high schools and will follow-up with in-person science cafs at three participating schools.<br/><br/>Given the unique role of the Labrador Sea in providing a pathway for oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to enter the intermediate depths of the ocean, a quantification and mechanistic understanding of the gas uptake and transport in the basin is a leading scientific priority. Oxygenation of Labrador Sea water prevents large-scale hypoxia from developing anywhere in the Atlantic Ocean and anthropogenic CO2 storage in the basin is the highest in the global ocean. The assumption that, in the Atlantic Ocean, O2 and CO2 uptake and their variability are tied to the dynamics of heat loss and the overturning circulation pervades the literature but has never been evaluated on the basis of direct observations. Thus, GOHSNAP (Gases in the Overturning and Horizontal circulation of the Subpolar North Atlantic Program) addresses this gap and the urgent need to better understand interactions between gas uptake, transport, and the overturning circulation. Specifically, this program will provide a continuous 2-year record of the trans-basin, full water column transport of O2 across the southern boundary of the Labrador Sea, leveraging the mooring infrastructure of the US-lead, international Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). The addition of O2 sensors at various depths on this array, supplemented by observations collected by autonomous platforms will allow for the quantification of O2 export from the Labrador Sea.  The data will further be used to empirically model carbon concentrations and estimate carbon export. Proposed instruments will also measure the mixed layer O2 and pCO2 for two winters, from which air-sea gas exchange will be calculated and compared against analogous observations in the convective interior of the Labrador Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coupled with advancements in integrated sensor technologies, IoT has generated a new wave of opportunities for cooperation and collaboration between devices, machines and humans to create smart systems. Motivated by the wide array of opportunities in the IoT space, this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site will target developing smart and autonomous IoT systems. The REU site exposes students to emerging areas of computer science and engineering and provides them with the opportunities for hands-on research training and experience in emerging smart technologies. This research experience, along with the proposed student development activities, encourages students to continue on to further their education. The program particularly recruits students from campuses and community colleges in rural and low-income communities across Georgia, as these students often are first-generation college attendees and/or have limited opportunities to work with the latest technologies.<br/><br/>The vision of the REU site is to encourage competitive research in early stages of undergraduate students' career and motivate them to pursue higher education to conduct highly skilled research and development in future. The site supports 10 participants for an 8-week period in the summer of each REU year. The participants work in teams on specific projects mentored by the REU site?s organizing group that consists of five faculty mentors, two mentors from industry and four graduate student mentors. Each of these projects will use a variety of hardware, ranging from sensors to mobile devices to drones, and will provide an experience and opportunity to the students in developing their skills to design end-to-end IoT systems. The specific intellectual merits of the program are derived from diverse projects in IoT and autonomous systems. In addition to the technical development, students get training on personal and professional development such as advise on pursuing graduate studies, primer on ethics and professionalism in research, and exercise in writing and presenting technical work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to the great progress in understanding and predicting TC tracks and moderate progress in TC intensity changes, quantitative rainfall forecast of TCs is still a challenge issue, and little progress has been made. This project seeks to advance our understanding of TC rainfall distribution by focusing on interactions between landfalling TCs and the atmospheric environment and to improve quantitative rainfall forecast of TCs during TC landfall. The principal investigator will foster involvement of a graduate student with particularly consideration of women and underrepresented minority students in carrying out this research project. <br/><br/>The most challenging aspect of predicting rainfall in landfalling TCs is not only the intensity and the extent but also the spatial distribution of precipitation especially the heaviest rainfall area. The distribution and asymmetries of TC rainfall are important features inherently linked to TC-induced inland flooding and TC size changes. The overall goal of the work is to understand distribution, evolution, and asymmetries of rainfall during landfalling processes of TCs through statistical analyses of long-term satellite observations. This project will examine physical processes that influence changes of rainfall patterns for landfalling TCs in before, during, and after landfall stages, and for landfalling versus over-ocean TCs. Factors to be considered in these processes include diurnal variation, extratropical transition, and other environmental conditions such as vertical wind shear, total available moisture, and sea surface temperatures. The research will fill a critical gap in our scientific understanding of TC rainfall evolution by focusing on physical processes of precipitation changes during landfalling TCs and environmental impacts on landfalling TCs. A better understanding of these TC features is essential for improving landfalling TC forecasts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particularly notable are the many huge eruptions that produced the Columbia River Basalts (CRB) between 17 and 6 million years ago. The CRB lavas inundated Oregon and Washington, producing thick stacks of lava, in places of thousands of feet or more, and covering in excess of 150,000 square miles. Such voluminous lava outpourings are Earth?s biggest volcanic events and understanding them is key to understanding fundamental aspects of the dynamic behavior of our planet. Lavas of the CRB were fed from fissure eruptions similar to those observed today on Hawaii, Iceland, or at other areas with active basalt volcanism, but much much larger in scale. In recent years, it has become clear the magmas feeding such events can travel long distances laterally underground, instead of vertically from an underlying melt source prior to their eruption. This study will address whether CRB magmas travelled in the subsurface for long distances, and where the magma storage sites were located, to better understand where magmas from the deep Earth interior (> 40 km) ascended to the surface.<br/><br/>This study will combine geochronological, geochemical, and rock magnetic techniques to examine magma flow within Columbia River feeder dikes, and thus will test models of magma transport. Along-strike variations in the age, chemistry, and flow direction in the ~400 km-long Columbia River dike system will be examined to constrain regional-scale magma transport dynamics in the plumbing system of this Large Igneous Province (LIP). This multidisciplinary approach will provide the first dataset of magnetic flow for Columbia River LIP dikes and to supply new and critical constraints on the timing and dynamics of magma emplacement in the province, which are currently lacking. Key questions related to Columbia River LIP magmatism that can be addressed with the new data include: 1) Did Columbia River LIP magmas originate from the inferred inception position of the Yellowstone hotspot at the Nevada-Oregon border? 2) Were there discrete zones of magma storage, from which magma travelled laterally away to feed flood lavas? 3) Over what timescales were dike swarms emplaced, and did the site of magmatism progressively migrate northward away from the Yellowstone hotspot? This project will support graduate and undergraduate students at two institutions, and build an international collaboration with faculty and students at the University of Auckland, NZ. The PI team will also run field workshops for local high school teachers in both Oregon and Washington.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most recent such earthquake occurred on January 26th, 1700, and GPS data acquired during the last two decades suggest that strain is accumulating across the subduction zone fault in preparation for a future earthquake. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how the geologic structure of the subduction zone will impact strain release during a Cascadia earthquake. Different plausible earthquake scenarios result in quite different predicted ground shaking, which in turn influences building codes and emergency response plans. This project will image the structure of the crust in the region where large Cascadia earthquakes are thought to occur. The objective is to understand three-dimensional variations in seismic velocity in order to provide insights into the factors that control segmentation of slip during earthquakes and the resulting amplitude of ground shaking in populated areas and sedimentary basins. With its large footprint and involvement of many field hands, this project will provide student research experiences and opportunities for public outreach and education about geohazards in the Pacific Northwest. This project is a collaboration between Oregon State University, University of Oregon, Eugene, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the U.S. Geological Survey.<br/><br/>This project has the ultimate goal of generating a high-resolution model of an active subduction system that will span the Cascadia plate boundary, including the transition between major along-strike segments, and cross the transition from the nominally locked zone down-dip to depths where plate motion is accommodated by episodic tremor and slip. A dense network of temporary short-period seismometers along the coast of the Pacific Northwest will extend high resolution imaging of the structure of the overlying and down-going plates, as well as the thickness and characteristics of material within the plate interface zone, to depths that are critical for understanding earthquake processes. The array design includes a single deployment of three-component instruments at 1-km intervals along the onshore extension of dip lines embedded within a sparser grid of seismometers spaced 7-10 km apart for a total of ~700 three-component seismic stations. To tie results from the seismogenic part of the plate boundary to larger-scale forearc and arc structure, two profiles will extend across the forearc. All stations will record natural sources as well as man-made sources for the duration of the deployment. The seismic data from this experiment will be made immediately available to the community. The resulting high-resolution 3D Vp model will also be made accessible and is critical for constraining analyses of seismic noise, magnetotelluric and potential field data, as well as for improving predictions of earthquake ground shaking and tsunami generation in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by organizing a conference on Being Human in STEM (HSTEM).  HSTEM began at Amherst College in response to student calls for greater inclusion and sense of belonging in their academic experiences. Students at the participating institutions, especially students from underrepresented groups, have described the many challenges they face as they pursue a pathway in STEM. In response, the institutions developed and refined the HSTEM model for inclusive STEM curriculum.  The HSTEM model incorporates specific teaching practices, together with a course about inclusion and diversity research, and student-led projects focused on STEM education. HSTEM teams investigate the experiences of diverse students in STEM courses and labs, seeking to understand challenges and best practices on their own campus and in other educational environments. Since it was developed in 2016, the HSTEM program has been adopted by seven other institutions.  More than a dozen additional colleges have asked about how to establish HSTEM initiatives on their campuses. The 2020 HSTEM conference will help the HSTEM program leaders to develop shareable HSTEM program resources, develop new partnerships and implementation models, design plans to evaluate HSTEM impacts on students and faculty across institutions, and explore strategies for sustaining the initiative. <br/><br/>As their student populations become increasingly more diverse, colleges and universities are interested in strategies and interventions that can increase the success of all students.  HSTEM initiatives have the potential to engage a critical mass of students, faculty, and staff in seeding inclusion principles throughout higher education institutions. Because they promote the ability of faculty, students, and staff to learn together and share experiences, HSTEM courses and pedagogical practices enable conversations about diversity and inclusion across traditional boundaries.  Students become co-creators of knowledge alongside their instructors and institutional changes can be aligned with student needs and experiences. The 2020 HSTEM Conference will convene HSTEM leaders and student partners from Yale and Brown Universities, Amherst and Williams Colleges, and the University of Utah. Conference sessions will refine and standardize strategies for assessing the success of HSTEM programs, determine how to best implement the program across different institutional settings, and lay the groundwork for sustaining the program and expanding it to other institutions. After the conference, participants will collaborate to increase access to HSTEM resources by establishing systems and tools for national dissemination and contributing to a publicly available online repository. Conference participants will also formulate guidelines for other institutions to adopt the model and work to develop a more formal network of HSTEM institutions. The conference structure is designed to accomplish these goals via the following components: workshop sessions to engage in analysis of shared and unique features of HSTEM models across partner campuses; panels of student HSTEM partners to reflect on future opportunities to enhance the HSTEM model to better serve student success needs;  an external keynote speaker who is a nationally recognized STEM inclusive pedagogy expert to ground and expand the conversation; and visioning sessions with regional diversity and inclusion experts to consider how to sustain, assess, and expand the HSTEM initiative.

However, much like the early days of the steam engine, a satisfactory understanding of deep learning has so far been elusive. We currently lack a formal theory of deep learning, one that could explain why we can train overly complex models with seemingly not enough training data and still find solutions that generalize to previously unseen data, or why models trained for one task also perform well on another related task, or why trained models are so vulnerable to slight, nearly imperceptible, corruptions of data. This project aims to address this need by developing an explanatory and prescriptive theory of deep learning that is tightly integrated with and motivated by the practice. Rather than view learning as simply a black-box optimization problem, the approach investigates the inner workings by shedding light on algorithmic heuristics that potentially play an equally important role in endowing the trained models with excellent generalization properties. Given the broad applicability of deep learning and the complementary nature of theoretical analyses and empirical studies in the proposed research,  the project is particularly suited for integrating research into education and outreach. The proposed educational activities include curriculum development, summer internships, hackathons, and instructor's outreach through local Baltimore programs. <br/><br/>The project investigates the role of explicit algorithmic regularization in the form of early stopping, batch normalization, and dropout, as well as the choice of optimization algorithms and network architecture in providing an adequate inductive bias that helps with generalization. A second overarching goal of the project is to understand, more broadly, the generalization phenomenon in deep learning. It seeks to understand why systems that memorize the training data can still generalize well, how the neural network architecture enables transfer learning, and how to design robust algorithms that will guarantee that deep learning solutions generalize despite adversarial corruption to data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed innovation can reduce the loss by protecting bioactive components from the environmental stresses products experience during processing, transport, and storage, thus increasing economic value, improving food sustainability, and improving efficacy. Furthermore, the technology can also increase the absorption of health-promoting components into the human body, thereby increasing their efficacy. The proposed innovation provides a safe and cost-effective method of improving the bioavailability of bioactive agents through oral administration.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on an encapsulation technology utilizing food-grade biopolymers to create cross-linked protective membranes around bioactive-loaded food particles. Advantages include the ability to endure environmental stresses such as extreme pH values, high salt concentrations, freezing and thawing; and improving the bioavailability and absorption of bioactive compounds from food. Food-grade ingredients can be used to assemble colloidal delivery systems to protect bioactives from the harsh conditions foods experience during their shelf life as well as during passage through the gastrointestinal tract.  Moreover, they can be used to target bioactive agents to specific tissues. For instance, preliminary studies have shown that the bioaccessibility of curcumin can be increased by 80% using the proposed technology compared with existing products on the market. The proposed technology can therefore increase efficacy, reduce costs, and extend the shelf life of health-promoting functional foods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this program will provide a continuous 2-year record of the trans-basin, full water column transport of O2 across the southern boundary of the Labrador Sea, leveraging the mooring infrastructure of the US-lead, international Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP). The addition of O2 sensors at various depths on this array, supplemented by observations collected by autonomous platforms will allow for the quantification of O2 export from the Labrador Sea.  The data will further be used to empirically model carbon concentrations and estimate carbon export. Proposed instruments will also measure the mixed layer O2 and pCO2 for two winters, from which air-sea gas exchange will be calculated and compared against analogous observations in the convective interior of the Labrador Sea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In pursuit of these ends, democracy aid is dispensed by various actors including democracy-promoting international non-governmental organizations (DINGOs). Such aid has skyrocketed, with 2008 global expenditures nearing $20 billion. Yet the success of this endeavor remains unclear because at the same time, hybrid regimes ? governments that co-opt democratic institutions and policies to mask authoritarian practices ? are proliferating. Moreover, aid is often ineffective, and typical aid strategies can incentivize superficial democratization while legitimizing and reinforcing nondemocratic rule. Thus, DINGOs themselves may contribute to hybrid growth. However, the role of DINGOs and their strategies regarding hybrids and democratization is underexplored. This project empirically examines how nations? ties to DINGOs impact their level of democracy in policy and practice, as well as how various types of DINGO aid strategies improve or reduce DINGO effectiveness in promoting democracy. As such, the project assesses how democracy aid influences hybrid regimes. By identifying factors relevant for democracy promotion, this project will help various actors such as nonprofits and governments safeguard human rights and improve citizen well-being worldwide. <br/> <br/>This project combines statistical and computational methodologies to examine DINGOs? impact on democratic policies and practices cross-nationally in five-year intervals from 1980 to 2015. It uses content analysis of the Yearbook of International Organizations to count nations? annual DINGO ties for each selected year. It then employs random effects regression to understand how those ties impact democracy in policy and in practice cross-nationally and longitudinally, using a novel measure of democracy. It further investigates this relationship by analyzing 30 DINGOs? annual reports using one type of automated content analysis, Latent Dirichlet Application (LDA) topic modeling, to quantify which strategies DINGOs pursue, and to what degree. Finally, it draws upon these data to analyze how DINGO impact on democracy varies by DINGO strategy cross-nationally and over time using random effects regression. This design thus makes it possible to examine and compare, for the first time, the direct effects of DINGOs on democracy in policy and in practice, and how aid strategy modifies this relationship. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding democracy promotion and comparative governmental organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural gas hydrates are solid structures formed by water and gas that can block oil & gas pipelines, which can lead to pipeline ruptures, causing spills and environmental disasters, production interruptions, and even loss of life. The ability to predict gas hydrate formation and fluid dynamics based on molecular-level models has the potential to revolutionize the strategies used for gas hydrate control in oil and gas pipelines, as well as other gas hydrate energy applications. The predictive capability of gas hydrate fluid dynamics models is currently lacking due to the inability to fundamentally model the timescales for hydrate formation. The principle aim of the project is to develop a kinetic molecular model to predict gas hydrate formation times based on a synergistic experimental and molecular modeling campaign, leading to the ability to predict quantitatively gas hydrate formation in pipelines. The project is also focused on inclusion of under-represented minority students in STEM disciplines, via outreach activities that target students at all stages of development, industry engagement, and state-of-the-art web-based materials.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to quantify the rate-limiting mechanisms in gas hydrate formation to provide a predictive fluid dynamics model for gas hydrate formation. Identification of which mechanisms of hydrate formation (i.e. nucleation, growth, agglomeration, adhesion) is rate-limiting under different scenarios remains unknown, and yet must be overcome in order to have a predictive fluid dynamics model. This knowledge gap will be filled by the four main aims of the project: (1) obtain free energy barriers representative of gas hydrate growth, agglomeration and adhesion; (2) assess the reliability of (1) with in-situ micromechanical force and film growth measurements; (3) develop a computationally efficient stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo model that incorporates information from (1) and (2); (4) incorporate the outcomes from (3) into the transient fluid dynamics model and validate this predictive stochastic model against flow-loop experiments. This approach will provide a potential game-changing improvement to the fluid dynamics simulation model and molecular-based predictions of hydrate formation in pipelines.

The goal of this technology is to address swallowing and speech related problems, such as Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing problems).  The occurrence of Dysphagia is as high as 22% in people over 50 years of age and as many as 30% of them receive inpatient medical treatment. In addition, 8-9% of young children have a speech disorder and about 50% of the US children (3-17 years of age) receive intervention services for a voice, speech, language, or swallowing disorder. Further, the swallowing and speech problems result from other illnesses such as stroke, spinal cord injury, head neck cancer, and Parkinson?s disease.  The proposed device will be powered through a wireless system connected to a battery worn in a necklace-like non-invasive device. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a wearable intraoral neuromodulation system to solve problems with intraoral sensorimotor loop operation that cause swallowing and speech disorders. By monitoring and stimulating the intraoral organs, this technology will provide high spatiotemporal resolution to favorably intervene in intraoral sensorimotor loop operations. For example, the technology is designed to monitor the beginning of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and modulate the activity of pharyngeal muscles for swallowing by stimulating the soft palatal nerves. In another example, the technology will monitor the tongue movement during speech and modulate the movement or posture of the tongue by applying stimulation at specific times and specific locations of the tongue. This device also has a unique feature using real-time wireless power transfer between the intraoral coil and necklace coil, which can be easily maintained. The necklace electronics have a battery capacity that is able to power the intraoral electronics for a full day. This real-time power transfer may significantly reduce (or eliminate) the size of the battery for the intraoral device.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Responding to these changes in the labor market since the 1970s, a growing number of American families pursued money outside of labor markets. In this project, three case studies will follow the rise of direct selling (Avon, Amway, Herbalife), leasing of accessory dwelling units within homes, and the rise of home equity extraction. Direct sellers in the 1980s and 1990s carefully balanced attempts to marketize kinship and social ties, without severing them irreparably, that provided housewives an avenue to pursue secondary incomes without fully abandoning the ideal of the breadwinner-homemaker model. Families who began leasing spare bedrooms and garages in the 1990s sought to avoid the stigma of immigrant informality by leasing ?granny flats? and ?in-law units,? portraying their marketization of the single-family home as a natural extension of the nuclear family. Extractions of home-equity in the early 2000s tapped into long-time associations between property ownership and landed independence, allowing homeowners to interpret equity loans as tapping into their wealth, rather than as taking on risky loans. These cases illustrate household strategies to generate resources outside standard wages?providing a lens into a rearrangement of household economic life since the 1970s. Findings will inform governmental policies, particularly those governing dwelling leasing and home equity extraction, to maximize their appropriate use balanced against risk.   <br/><br/>As American households faced uncertain returns to waged labor, its members grew likely to embrace three strategies of industriousness: (1) labor-intensive industriousness characterized by increases in the number of wage earners or the time devoted to wage work by a household; (2) distributive industriousness, characterized by entrepreneurial turns toward kinship and social networks in attempts to siphon small but regular access to cash resources; and (3) rentier industriousness, characterized by attempts at securing incomes from claims on household goods or assets. Because most social research on labor restructuring focuses on labor-intensive industriousness, the core of this project are case studies of the distributive and rentier household activity.  Leveraging administrative and archival data from municipalities, federal regulators, congressional records, newspapers, and industry publications, each of the three case studies analyzes: (1) the motivations driving early industrious activity; (2) regulatory challenges and incorporation; and (3) trajectories of socio-economic, racial, and gendered diffusion across groups of households. This project suggests that at the root of recent expansions in economic informality are not new technology platforms, but rather changes in labor market organization dating back to the 1980s. The findings of this research illuminate sociological theories regarding the family and its intersection with the U.S. economy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Findings will also provide insight into related changes as work continues to evolve in the United States and the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immediately following the impacts to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, tourism business owners and employees begin to make recovery decisions that affect the resilience of coastal communities. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project examines the factors and information networks that influence recovery decisions in Ocracoke and Hatteras, North Carolina, which were substantially impacted by Hurricane Dorian (September 2019). The remote nature of these communities makes them particularly vulnerable, as their transportation network is built upon a single state highway and/or ferry service that, when damaged, can affect access to recovery resources. Their dependence on tourism also makes them economically vulnerable as tourism benefits (e.g., jobs, tax revenues) rely on transportation access and lodging availability. Similar disaster-related impacts may become increasingly common in other coastal tourism-dependent communities due to potential increases in storm intensity and frequency in conjunction with sea-level rise. By identifying the factors and networks that influence early recovery decisions, this project contributes to NSF?s mission to advance national welfare and promote the progress of science. Specifically, this study increases the understanding of individual disaster recovery decisions within the tourism sector, which cumulatively influence a community?s ability to reestablish its built environment and economic base. This study also identifies the communication pathways that enable more informed near-term recovery decisions, which can be activated in future disaster response, tourism crisis management, and community resiliency building efforts.<br/><br/>The goal of our project is to compare the factors and information networks that influence information processing and recovery decision making in two remote post-disaster tourism-dependent communities. This project has four objectives: (1) documenting various factors that influence tourism stakeholders? recovery decisions; (2) identifying information networks accessed by tourism stakeholders to inform recovery decisions; (3) evaluating the extent to which recovery information activated through those networks is processed; and (4) understanding decision making pathways that influence risk perceptions and intended recovery decisions. These objectives will be accomplished by integrating the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) model with Social Network Analysis (SNA) in the analysis of data generated during in-depth interviews with tourism business owners, employees, and community leaders, as well as state emergency response officials. Data will be thematically analyzed for factors and RISP model predictors that influence recovery decisions, and information networks will be mapped using SNA to identify influential pathways for recovery decision making. Additionally, community-level data will be compared to identify if, and how, varying infrastructure damage and access to recovery resources impact decision making, which will enhance the transferability of our findings. Collecting these data in a near-term post-disaster context is critical, as the state of a tourism destination (e.g., availability of recovery funds, others? recovery decisions) impacts the availability of future decision options. The findings will reveal the factors and information pathways that influence disaster recovery decisions in a synergistic examination of business and household recovery decisions. More specifically, the findings will identify the ways in which information processing of current and prior experiences, perceptions of workforce capacity and recovery of the built environment, network support availability, and anticipated tourism demand influence recovery decision making, as well as expose capacity needs to maintain the tourism industry in near-term, post-disaster contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The classical view of how hot, formerly-deep rocks become exposed at the Earth?s surface invokes processes unrelated to their high-temperature transformation (metamorphism), such as erosion that may occur over many millions of years, long after metamorphism. More recently, geoscientists have discovered some places where formerly-deep, hot rocks were rapidly transported toward the Earth?s surface, not as magma (one mechanism for rapid transport), but as mostly-solid, flowing crust. The central hypothesis of this research is that rapid ascent of deep rocks to the Earth?s surface occurs on a large-scale, not just in unusual, local sites. Most rocks do not record their earlier, deep history, but some do, and these can be investigated to understand the conditions, mechanisms, and timing of transport of deep, hot rocks toward the Earth?s surface, with implications for understanding the thermal and structural evolution of continents, including the distribution of mineral resources. Societal benefits of this project involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in field and analytical skills in an important science, technology, engineering, and science (STEM) discipline. The project also represents a collaboration between researchers at the University of Minnesota and the University of Montpellier (France), including interaction and creation of educational materials for the general public for natural history museum. The principal investigators disseminate their research findings in part through the organization of an international field-forum on crustal flow systems.<br/><br/>Domal structures comprised of high-grade metamorphic rocks (gneiss domes) are accessible manifestations of deep-crustal flow systems in mountain systems and represent powerful and efficient mechanisms of mass and heat transfer in continental crust. The material in domes may be deeply sourced, but most gneiss domes record emplacement at relatively shallow crustal levels, as the dominant quartzofeldspathic rocks in domes are poor recorders of pressure-temperature paths. This research takes advantage of the more complete record of pressure-temperature-time history preserved in mafic rock inclusions in quartzofeldspathic gneiss, with a specific focus on orogenic eclogite and amphibolite in five gneiss domes of the French Massif Central. Based on previous work showing that eclogite and host rocks in one dome in this region record the same age, and that this age represents the timing of high-pressure metamorphism, this research tests the idea that domes are the ?tip of the iceberg? of regional deep-crustal flow systems. According to this hypothesis, dome-rocks can be used to investigate the conditions, timing, and consequences of lateral and vertical flow via field and analytical studies that include calculation of pressure-temperature-time histories of high-pressure mafic rocks (eclogite) and associated amphibolite in a system of spatially-related domes. Key data in this research include the composition and age of zircon, rutile, and titanite as determined by integrated thermobarometry and Laser ablation split stream - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LASS-ICPMS) Uranium-Lead  (U-Pb) geochronology and trace element analysis, as well as in situ oxygen isotope and microstructural analysis of zircon to evaluate the role of fluids in recrystallization during high-pressure - high-temperature metamorphism in the deep orogenic crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To prime the development of such a literature, this workshop ? Understanding Accelerators as Organizations that Influence Diversity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship ? will convene faculty researchers and graduate students in organization science and entrepreneurship as well as practitioners who facilitate accelerators. Once assembled, participants will set forth an agenda for future research that will advance theories of organization about accelerators while attending to issues of relevance in practice. The output from the gathering will be shared widely to stimulate awareness about the need for greater diversity and inclusion in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and the means by which scholars and practitioners can collaborate on rigorous and relevant research. Moreover, the workshop aims to be the beginning of an ongoing community of shared interest that can continue to move forward scholarship on entrepreneurship and diversity over time.<br/><br/>In recent decades, studies of science education have shifted the expectations for diversity and inclusion contexts for learning about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Despite the overlap between STEM and HTHG entrepreneurship, only limited insights have transferred from informal STEM learning contexts to accelerators. Starting with these gaps, this workshop will highlight what is known (and what needs to be known) about accelerators as organizations and their impact on matters of diversity and inclusion in HTHG entrepreneurship. The developed research agenda will encourage interdisciplinary scholarship on matters of diversity and inclusion in contexts for entrepreneurship education. New insights stand to be fostered in organizational science regarding how to support greater diversity and inclusion in accelerators as well as in adjacent activity settings such as universities with formal entrepreneurship programs and businesses in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. These insights will advance scientific knowledge on the role that the processes and practices of accelerators have on the initial involvement and career trajectories of entrepreneurs from non-dominant population groups (including women, people of color, people from working class backgrounds, and people from rural communities), thereby promoting greater equity in the innovation economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results also will have an impact on manufacturing facilities and other complex engineered systems, such as robots, and cobots (collaborative robots), that have several complex computer-controlled, networked devices/instruments that need professional quality service to avoid downtime and failure.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project based on the development of technology for quantitative, predictive methods and tools that utilize quality-related key performance indicators (KPIs), that can be measured, calibrated, and enforced during service operations in computer-numerical controlled machines (CNCs), additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing machines, and complex engineered systems.  Currently, there is no method or tool available for predicting the effectiveness or the level of success or risk of the services provided. The methods utilized are not systems engineering-focused, but rather financial accounting, and may or may not include reports of historical data to indicate the status of engineering-focused services provided. The technology under development is based on quantifiable service quality-focused key process/performance indicators (KPIs), using mathematical models, algorithms, and multimedia software visualization methods. This enables users to quantify levels of product/process quality service. In addition, the platform may be used to quantify and predict the product quality service as an index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Interface Design and Engineered Assembly of Low Dimensional Structures (CREST-IDEALS) at the City College of New York. The goal of this research is understanding the optoelectronic properties of ultrasmall CdSe quantum dots (QDs). Quantum Dots are on the nano scale which results in optical and electronic properties that are different from larger particles.  QDs have the potential to tap into the enormous potential of Solar Energy.  The proposed work intends to investigate ultrasmall quantum dots synthesized by the researcher with x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques. These techniques will allow the researcher to more fully understand the ability of ultrasmall quantum dots to transfer charge and formulate a theoretical model to explain the behavior. This analysis will allow the incorporation of ultrasmall QDs into solar cell designs.<br/> <br/>Ultrasmall quantum dots display broad emission despite their monodispersity. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) will allow for the investigation of which excitation wavelengths can cause the emission of a specified wavelength. Preliminary PLE data indicates that there are states within the bandgap to which direct absorption is possible.  PLE data gathered from Qds will be compared to time resolved photoluminescence data (TRPL). The TRPL allows one to detect multiexponential decay systems, indicating that such systems have multiple lifetimes. Two acceptor species will be investigated with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The acceptor species include a) molecules (ligands) of both e- donating and e- accepting character and b) carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  The molecules will begin with investigating alkylthiols of varying chain length and benzene sulfonic monohydrate (BSAM). Qds will be embedded within CNTs as a means of not only charge transfer enhancement but also QD alignment for connectivity between QDs as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At present, these systems are optimized through custom architecture selection and design optimization by an experienced team -- a process that is not conducive to the low-cost, fast-paced development cycles required for market deployment in consumer applications, e.g., IoT devices, wearables, and automotive. This project aims to develop a design flow that minimizes the number of complex steps requiring human oversight, substantially reduces product development cycle time and cost, and maximizes power-converter performance by considering performance variation/degradation over lifetime. The automation platform developed through this award will allow a small number of engineers to design and optimize these systems, enabling designers to spend more time on developing novel converter architectures and exploring the design space for new circuit topologies. The educational activities involve integrating design automation for integrated electronics with of student training from academic stages from K-12 through college level. The  findings of the project will be incorporated into two courses at Arizona State University.<br/><br/>This project will advocate a novel paradigm for automating design of analog systems, in particular power electronics. Integrated built-in-self-test will be used to monitor power system performance and update statistical models used during the design phase, thus increasing the occurrences of first-pass design success. The design automation of these closed-loop systems will be achieved through: a) creation of analytical models to express the numerous power converter architectures, b) development of a circuit component design library, c) a circuit simulation methodology for collecting a representative subset of design parameters that will correlate to the relevant performance space, d) creation of statistical models and data that can be used to fit to geometric programming (GP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, and e) development of a computationally efficient and accurate optimization approach. The automation methods generated from this research effort, including the methodology for creating statistical models and collecting empirical data, the generated circuit component design library, and the algorithms for optimizing a closed-loop power converter system with hierarchical circuits may be used for design of other closed-loop or complex analog systems, such as phase-locked loops (PLLs) and sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, the age of this dissolved organic carbon is thousands of years old, even though it is thought to form during photosynthesis in the surface ocean. One explanation for the age of this carbon is the amount of time that it takes for carbon to circulate through the ocean. Investigators at the University of California Irvine (UCI) will investigate the aging of dissolved organic carbon in the Pacific, Southern and Indian oceans using C-14 isotopes. This work is important for knowing how carbon produced from human activities will be distributed on Earth in the future. This project will support the work of two graduate and two undergraduate students, providing hands-on experience that will prepare them for careers as scientists and educators. Both graduate students will be involved in a variety of educational activities. They will also help teach a short course on applications of C-14 in Ecology and Earth System Science for graduate students, technicians, postdocs and researchers during summer. UCI is a Hispanic-serving institution (27% of undergraduates identify as Hispanic), and 60% of students who attend UCI are first generation family representatives. <br/><br/>	This study will examine the concentration, isotopic (14C, 13C) and molecular composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in depth profiles from the Pacific, Southern and Indian Oceans. This information will help to determine the main controls on DOC cycling in the world?s oceans. The project will test the hypothesis that circulation is the primary control on DOC cycling in the deepest water (>3500 meters). The research will also investigate two alternative processes that could influence the age of DOC in deep water (2000-3000 meters): (1) dissolution of surface-derived particles and (2) input of ancient carbon from hydrothermal vents and flanks. Spectroscopic and spectrometric measurements designed to characterize a portion of the DOC will be performed on surface and deep water. Results will be incorporated into an inverse model of DOC cycling to determine the main processes controlling the DOC cycle in the ocean. DOC may serve as a sink for excess carbon dioxide produced from human activities and the size of the refractory DOC pool in the ocean could increase as circulation slows. Measuring the 14C age of DOC in the surface and deep ocean is important for understanding how the global carbon cycle will change as the Earth's climate shifts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pattern of species is so ubiquitous that the question of why this pattern occurs is often overlooked. Why has life not evolved into a single superorganism rather an array of species, or why has it evolved into discrete clusters rather than a continuum? Researchers who study the process called speciation aim to answer these fundamental questions. This project is one of the first of its kind to extend the research of speciation to viruses. Until recently, it was thought that viral diversity was arrayed along a continuum and did not coalesce into distinct species. New information on viral genetics has revealed that viruses do indeed form into distinct clusters. The researchers will use laboratory experiments and state of the art biotechnologies to determine how different biological variables affect viral speciation. This research will add to a general understanding of speciation, as well as to improve our understanding of the drivers of viral evolution. The researchers will design teaching modules for undergraduate students to learn about virus classification and speciation, while also contributing to virology research.<br/> <br/>In 2016, the researchers published a landmark paper in the journal Science where they reported observing a virus called bacteriophage lambda evolve into two new species. This was a unique observation because speciation was thought to take too long to observe during the course of a laboratory experiment and because at the time, it was debatable whether or not viruses formed into species. The research group is building on this previous result by determining how three biological variables ? genetic architecture, resource competition, and gene flow ? affect lambda?s speciation. To accomplish this, the researchers will employ synthetic biology technologies to measure the fitness landscape of lambda, computer programs to simulate and predict lambda evolution, and evolution experiments to test the predictions. In addition, an education module will be created to teach students in a course called Phage Hunters about viral speciation and species concepts. Phage Hunters is taught at universities worldwide and provides training through authentic research experiences. One of the goals of the module will be to have students perform research by discovering new viral species through bioinformatic analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events represent the intersection of geologic processes that proceed over thousands to millions of years and destabilization of the volcanic reservoir which may occur rapidly over only days to years. These processes may be interrogated through retrospective geologic studies of past eruptions and geophysical monitoring, respectively. This project is focused on integrating these approaches at the Three Sisters Volcanic Complex, a ?very high threat potential? volcanic system located in the western United States. The goals are to elucidate hazards specific to the Three Sisters through the investigation of recent eruptions and volcanic unrest and produce new conceptual and quantitative models that can be applied to understand the hazards and improve eruption forecasting for active volcanoes globally. The results of this project will be disseminated to the general public through animation and videos published on-line and a self-guided geology hiking guide made available to the many recreational visitors to the Three Sister?s Wilderness Area.<br/><br/>Linking the processes that catalyze the growth, evolution, destabilization, and eruption of magma reservoirs to their expression as observable unrest represents an important scientific frontier that requires inter-disciplinary collaborations across the geosciences. Parallel advances in geophysics, petrochronology, and numerical modeling have made substantial contributions to the understanding of magma reservoir processes. Yet, these methods remain poorly integrated. The unusual confluence of frequent late Pleistocene to late Holocene eruptions, which range in composition from basaltic andesite to rhyolite, with modern volcanic unrest make the Three Sisters a prime natural laboratory at which to pursue this integrated approach. This project will produce new crystal-scale petrochronologic data for lavas and associated explosive products erupted from the Three Sisters Volcanic Complex, central Oregon Cascades, during the last ca. 50,000 yr. These data will inform interpretations of: 1) the petrogenesis of the rhyolite and dacite lavas erupted at the Three Sisters and if there is a genetic relationship between these rock types; 2) the longevity and physical integration of the magma reservoir(s) that produced the late Pleistocene flare-up of intermediate and silicic volcanism; and 3) the nature and tempo of the processes that preceded, and potentially triggered, these eruptions. In parallel, a high-resolution Bouguer gravity survey will be conducted to constrain the physical structure of the modern magma reservoir. These new geochemical and geophysical data will be integrated with the existing geodetic observations of recent uplift in coupled models of magma dynamics and crustal deformation. Accordingly, these observations and models will quantitatively test if recent unrest at Three Sisters reflects similar processes to those associated with the late-Pleistocene volcanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from the first four years of OSNAP observations have challenged the current understanding of overturning circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.  This grant provides funding for an additional four years of observations in order to deliver to the community a ten-year time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar basin. Variations in these quantities have been invoked to explain changes in a wide range of physical, chemical and biological parameters in the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas, and Arctic Ocean. Thus, by quantifying Atlantic meridional overturning variability and understanding its drivers, OSNAP is providing a critical first step towards addressing societally-relevant, interdisciplinary questions concerning the melting of Greenland ice and Arctic sea-ice, heat content in the Arctic Ocean, climate of the Nordic Seas, and anthropogenic carbon storage. The researchers will actively engage the broader international communities through four workshops, each targeting a societally relevant theme: 1) ocean biogeochemistry and carbon sequestration; 2) overturning in ocean models; 3) Arctic cryosphere; and 4) Nordic Seas variability. Two new postdocs and one graduate student will be supported in this phase of OSNAP and will benefit from the diversity of methodologies and exposure to the large number of OSNAP international scientists. In addition, approximately 20 graduate students from different US and international institutions will receive field training through participation in OSNAP cruises through 2024.<br/><br/>The first four years of data from the OSNAP observing system have shown that the eastern subpolar region, from Greenland to Scotland, dominates the mean meridional mass and heat transport in the subpolar North Atlantic, while more than half of the total meridional freshwater transport occurs across the Labrador basin.

What governs overturning variability in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre on intra-seasonal to interannual time scales? 2. What are the sources of freshwater across the OSNAP section and what governs their variability? 3. What are the impacts of the meridional heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar gyre? Additional motivation for this next phase of OSNAP is provided by the fundamental advancements in our understanding of subpolar North Atlantic dynamics and variability, that will result from the four main U.S. OSNAP mooring arrays, individually and in combination with other OSNAP observations. Further observations are expected to provide a strong observational basis for a new paradigm of overturning in this region, which will include an understanding of the linkage between dense water formation and overturning - a connection present in climate models, yet unobserved to date. Additionally, this this work will further quantify the structure and transport of the upper and deep ocean boundary currents off the east and west coasts of Greenland and within the Iceland Basin, as well as determine their variability and forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But such characterization is not easy given that extreme events are, by definition, rare.  For example a ""100 year flood"" is a flood so large that it is unlikely to occur more than once a century (formally, it has less than a one percent chance of happening in any given year).  A further consideration is that extreme precipitation likelihood is affected by the season and by climate variations such as El Nino events, and also changes over time as a consequence of global warming.  In regions affected by landfalling hurricanes it is also important to separately assess their contribution to extreme precipitation, given the many ways in which hurricanes differ from other rain-bearing storms.<br/><br/>Work performed here uses a variety of statistical techniques to estimate the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events over the eastern US.  One set of tasks seeks to characterize the seasonality of extreme precipitation,  with the understanding that extreme event timing is often multimodal and may not align well with pre-defined seasons. The seasonality of extremes is assessed using a circular density approach in which the annual cycle is mapped to the unit circle and the timing of extreme events over the course of the year is represented by an angle-dependent probability density.  A second set of tasks evaluates secular changes in probability distributions using quantile regression models, and further investigates the effects of large-scale climate patterns on precipitation probabilities.  Additional work evaluates the impact of hurricanes on statistics of extreme precipitation in the study domain.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the value of extreme event statistics for anticipating and mitigating precipitation-related hazards.  The PIs have a specific focus on stormwater management as a transportation issue, and the project includes a review of standards for stormwater infrastructure design issued by state departments of transportation.  In addition, the project provides paid summer research training to two undergraduate students who are also funded to attend the national meeting of the Council on Undergraduate Research.

The causes of most cases are unknown, but genetic and environmental factors are linked to increased risk. This project will reveal the molecular events related to Parkinson's disease neuropathology and progression, thus facilitating new therapeutic interventions and more accurate prognoses. More generally, a tool will be developed for identifying the molecular basis of other central nervous system disorders related to protein folding, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and for evaluating new treatment methods for these diseases. Undergraduate students will be incorporated into aspects of this project with graduate students. The research will be used to enhance demonstrations for the Purdue Women in Engineering program and at the Brain Bowl during Purdue's Spring Fest, both of which target K-12. The laboratories involved on this project will be opened to students in classes that the investigators teach to illustrate concepts and demonstrate the relevance of class material to research, an exciting tool for encouraging graduate research and education.<br/><br/>A new fluorescence-based optical molecular imaging method suitable for the living brain will be developed and applied as a means to elucidate, for the first time, pathogenic mechanisms relating to the temporal and spatial development of Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Abnormal protein aggregation of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein is thought to be a critical early pathogenic event, and aggregation is postulated to occur first systemically, then in the brain stem, and then in later stages in specific areas of the brain where neuronal loss or dysfunction results in the cardinal motor and non-motor symptoms. The spread of aggregates through these different brain regions is thought to be similar to the spread of the prion protein involved in mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome. Understanding the relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregation and Parkinson's disease is of fundamental importance, in order to develop detection and treatment options. Aberrant calcium signaling is also a key Parkinson's disease indicator, and calcium ion perturbations in vulnerable neurons can be monitored with available fluorescent reporters. The proposed super-resolution optical imaging method will have the capacity to determine alpha-synuclein aggregation and site progression as well as calcium signaling in the brain of a living animal, potentially with a resolution of ten microns. The Research Plan is organized under two aims. Under the FIRST Aim, a simultaneous computational imaging and rat model study will be pursued to investigate the alpha-synuclein prion-like spreading mechanism that is thought to result in Parkinson's disease progression. Data collected weekly will be progressively used to aid the determination of precise point locations for alpha-synuclein aggregation. The fluorescent lifetime distribution of these sites is also expected to differ, based on aggregation level. Under the SECOND Aim, temporal signaling information will be obtained from microscope measurements of fluorescent calcium reporters in cell cultures and used to simulate neuron activation in the brain. This joint experimental and modeling effort will build a framework to allow investigation of whether perturbations of calcium signaling underlie neuron dysfunction or loss in Parkinson's disease, and the hypothesis that interactions between calcium and alpha-synuclein are involved in neurotoxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from the first four years of OSNAP observations have challenged the current understanding of overturning circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic.  This grant provides funding for an additional four years of observations in order to deliver to the community a ten-year time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes in the subpolar basin.

Calcium carbonate, the structural mineral of coral reefs, is becoming increasingly susceptible to dissolution (chemically-induced decomposition) due to the ocean?s uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This project is devoted to improving the accuracy of predictions and interpretations of the stability of different forms of calcium carbonate that are uniquely important to the oceanic ecosystem. The stability or instability of solid calcium carbonate in seawater is routinely evaluated from (a) measurements of the concentrations of dissolved chemical components in collected seawater samples and (b) calculations (mathematical models) of the amounts of dissolved calcium and dissolved carbonate in seawater that are required to prevent solid calcium carbonate from dissolving. The necessary calculations for modeling calcium carbonate stability are generated from experiments in which solid calcium carbonate particles are added to seawater samples and the particles are allowed to dissolve until dissolution ends and no further changes in the particles are observed thereafter. The models of calcium carbonate stability in seawater produced through such experiments are important to the shellfish industry and are important to understanding the natural chemical cycles of carbonate-bearing organisms that serve as food for economically-important marine organisms. Over the past decade, the economic interests of the shellfish industry have stimulated monitoring efforts to assess day-to-day changes in the stability of calcium carbonate in hatchery waters. It is also recognized that models of calcium carbonate stability are important to understanding the availability of very small organisms in the surface ocean that serve as an essential food for early-life-stage salmon. Current models of the stability of solid calcium carbonate in seawater are more than thirty-five years old and were generated using measurement techniques that are considered antiquated by modern standards. Modern state-of-the-art methods will be used in this project to determine the chemical conditions required for stability of solid calcium carbonate in seawater, and these measurements will then be used to create quantitative models of calcium carbonate stability over a wide range of salinities and temperatures. For outreach activities, the scientist plans to communicate results from the study to the public via interactive modules at the St. Petersburg Science Festival and the Oceanography Camp for Girls, as well as prepare a presentation for the St. Petersburg SciCafe series about this project and how it relates to ocean acidification.  This research will support the dissertation research of one graduate student and an undergraduate summer intern.    <br/><br/>This project is a state-of-the-art investigation of the solubility of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a uniquely important mineral in the global ocean. Weathering of terrestrial CaCO3 minerals adds alkalinity to seawater in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3-) and carbonate <br/>[CO3(2-)]. Marine calcifiers at the ocean surface precipitate solid CaCO3 for structural support and protection from predation. The biogenic CaCO3 produced by marine calcifiers settles into and dissolves within deeper waters. These processes, sometimes called the calcium carbonate pump, are important for transferring carbon from the surface ocean to depth. As such, calcium carbonate, in both its solid form and dissolved components, plays an integral role in the global carbon cycle. Assessments of marine CaCO3 solubility are essential for a quantitative understanding and interpretation of transformations between solid CaCO3 and its dissolved components. CaCO3 solubility is quantitatively expressed in terms of the product (Ksp) of the dissolved Ca2+ and CO3(2-)concentrations (mol/kg seawater) in seawater at equilibrium with a specified crystalline polymorph of CaCO3. Ksp is influenced by seawater temperature (T), salinity (S), and pressure (P) and is used to quantify saturation state (?), the degree to which seawater is under- or over-saturated with dissolved Ca2+ and CO3(2-). In view of the decreasing saturation states of CaCO3 in the global ocean, a consequence of ocean acidification, accurate quantitative assessments of Ksp are essential. In addition to the importance of Ksp characterizations in models of oceanic carbon cycling, Ksp parameterizations are essential to assessments of water chemistry in the shellfish industry. Over the past decade, the economic interests of shellfish growers have stimulated research into the effects of ? on shellfish health. CaCO3 solubility is also important to assessing the economics of certain fisheries. Models of calcium carbonate stability are important to understanding the availability of carbonate-bearing organisms in the surface ocean that serve as an essential food for early-life-stage salmon. Current models of the stability of solid calcium carbonate in seawater are more than thirty-five years old and were generated using measurement techniques that are considered antiquated by modern standards. In this project, Ksp will be determined using modern state-of-the-art procedures for measurements of pH, alkalinity, and carbonate ion concentrations.

For example, when a listener does not understand what was said by a speaker the first time, the speaker may repeat what they said in a clearer manner so that the listener can understand it. This seemingly simple act of enhancing intelligibility of speech for a listener is often carried out naturally by fluent speakers of the language, yet it can be difficult for people who produce less fluent and less intelligible speech, such as non-native speakers of the language. Not being understood by listeners has very real consequences for non-native speakers as it can significantly decrease their opportunities to obtain jobs and education, and more broadly, to participate in society as an equal member. The significance of this issue is highlighted by the growing population of non-native English speakers in the U.S. This project seeks to better understand why it can be difficult to enhance speech intelligibility in a non-native language by examining how speakers of different linguistic backgrounds use speech enhancement strategies in different communication contexts. The results of this project could inform the development of methodologies for second language learning as well as interventions for clinical populations who may experience difficulty enhancing their speech intelligibility. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand two aspects of what contributes to enhancing speech intelligibility: what kinds of strategies speakers use to enhance their speech and how these strategies are perceived by listeners. Specifically, the proposed experiments examine how a speaker?s ability to speak clearly is affected by different sources, such as the speaker's language background, characteristics of the speech materials (e.g., familiarity of the words or phrases), and characteristics of the communication context. Further, the project examines how speakers' attempts to enhance speech intelligibility translate to listeners' perception of this speech, including perceived degree of comprehensibility (how easy it is to understand the speech) and perceived degree of speaker effort (how hard the speaker is trying to speak clearly). This project will help us better understand the contributions from both speakers and listeners to enhancing speech intelligibility for a variety of native and non-native speaking populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how diverse communities are using and interpreting these new technologies is critical to our ability to grasp and forecast what justice looks like in the twenty-first century at the local, national, and international levels.  Much of the project's data will be made publicly available in order to inform legal and public policies regarding the use of geospatial technologies in judicial proceedings. Data dissemination will enhance the public's understanding of science and the scientific method through the construction of a public archive that documents the role of technology in investigations and justice proceedings. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/><br/>This multi-sited ethnographic research project is among the first empirical studies to examine how geospatial technologies are used by civil society stakeholders and legal experts in criminal and human rights investigations. In particular, research will focus on the new collaborations and contestations forming among litigants, civil society stakeholders, and technical and legal experts. Research will illuminate how geospatial technologies are being deployed by technical experts and laypersons alike in an effort to uncover forensic and other evidence for legal cases. The project will also explore whether and how these new forms of evidence are permitted within legal institutions, as well as the related tensions surrounding how different subject groups, including scientists and prosecutors, interpret the information generated by these technologies. The research project will use several qualitative methods to generate a rich data-set, including coding from 120 interviews with representatives of multiple population groups, participant observation of technology trainings and court proceedings, archival analysis of public media, and visual analysis of satellite imagery.

The most recent such earthquake occurred on January 26th, 1700, and GPS data acquired during the last two decades suggest that strain is accumulating across the subduction zone fault in preparation for a future earthquake. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how the geologic structure of the subduction zone will impact strain release during a Cascadia earthquake. Different plausible earthquake scenarios result in quite different predicted ground shaking, which in turn influences building codes and emergency response plans. This project will image the structure of the crust in the region where large Cascadia earthquakes are thought to occur. The objective is to understand three-dimensional variations in seismic velocity in order to provide insights into the factors that control segmentation of slip during earthquakes and the resulting amplitude of ground shaking in populated areas and sedimentary basins. With its large footprint and involvement of many field hands, this project will provide student research experiences and opportunities for public outreach and education about geohazards in the Pacific Northwest. This project is a collaboration between Oregon State University, University of Oregon, Eugene, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the U.S. Geological Survey.<br/><br/>This project has the ultimate goal of generating a high-resolution model of an active subduction system that will span the Cascadia plate boundary, including the transition between major along-strike segments, and cross the transition from the nominally locked zone down-dip to depths where plate motion is accommodated by episodic tremor and slip. A dense network of temporary short-period seismometers along the coast of the Pacific Northwest will extend high resolution imaging of the structure of the overlying and down-going plates, as well as the thickness and characteristics of material within the plate interface zone, to depths that are critical for understanding earthquake processes. The array design includes a single deployment of three-component instruments at 1-km intervals along the onshore extension of dip lines embedded within a sparser grid of seismometers spaced 7-10 km apart for a total of ~700 three-component seismic stations. To tie results from the seismogenic part of the plate boundary to larger-scale forearc and arc structure, two profiles will extend across the forearc. All stations will record natural sources as well as man-made sources for the duration of the deployment. The seismic data from this experiment will be made immediately available to the community. The resulting high-resolution 3D Vp model will also be made accessible and is critical for constraining analyses of seismic noise, magnetotelluric and potential field data, as well as for improving predictions of earthquake ground shaking and tsunami generation in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex behavioral sequences are assembled from simpler motor programs.  Like nest-building in birds and web-spinning in spiders, grooming in flies represents a flexible, innate, adaptive motor sequence.  This project will use the genetic tools available in flies, combined with new machine vision analysis, to identify the neurons that control fly grooming behavior.  It will focus on the connections between the brain and the ventral nervous system, since these descending neurons are a natural information bottleneck.  Understanding how a limited number of neurons convey commands and coordinate competing reflexes into productive behaviors will advance basic knowledge in neuroscience and provide conceptual insights into how any brain ? including human ones ? solve similar challenges.  One focus of the NSF's mission to promote basic science research is to understand the rules of life, and specifically to predict phenotypes.  This research contributes to ongoing efforts to generate maps of all the neurons and their connections in the fly by adding information about their behavioral functions. As part of the educational objectives of this project, the PI will organize a summer course at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics for experimentalists and theorists that will involve both cutting edge topics in modern systems neuroscience and theoretical approaches. Specific efforts will be made to recruit undergraduate students to this quantitative biology summer course. <br/><br/>This research will employ automated behavioral analysis of Drosophila grooming, optogenetic manipulations, and anatomical characterization of neuronal circuits.  Screens using new genetic reagents to target specific descending neurons will delineate their behavioral roles.  The project will characterize the projections and connections of these neurons to determine how they interface with sensory and motor circuits.  Activating combinations of descending neurons that initiate competing behavioral programs will reveal whether decisions are made in the brain or the ventral nerve cord.  Neural circuits that can be mapped in the fly represent fundamental motifs that perform computations common to all brains.

This project develops algorithms for RLAs where ballots are drawn in stages, as opposed to one at a time. <br/><br/>Current solutions are based on ratio tests such as the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) proposed by Wald in 1945, which is a most efficient test (smallest expected sample size) if the sample is tested after each ballot draw. In real elections, ballots are drawn in stages, n ballots at a time, and then tested. n may be tens of ballots for a local contest, or hundreds of ballots for a state-level contest. Direct application of the SPRT results in a very inefficient procedure for ballot polling audits. This project develops algorithms specifically for ballots drawn in stages, and preliminary results demonstrate a significant improvement in efficiency. Beginning with an algorithm for two-candidate elections and polling audits using sampling with replacement, this project develops algorithms for multiple-candidate elections and comparison audits.

Emotional reactivity is defined as the differences in how we react to emotionally charged words such as ?sweetheart?, ?disgust?, and neutral words, such as ?door?, ?cup?, as observed using various experimental techniques. Researchers have a good understanding of the language acquisition factors shaping bilinguals? emotional reactivity to words in their first and second language. Nevertheless, it is yet unknown how switching between languages, a common bilingual conversational act, affects emotional reactivity. Spurred by the work of sociolinguists and psychologists, this project aims to ascertain whether code-switching reduces emotionality and its findings will advance knowledge about the relationship between code-switching and emotionality. <br/><br/>Sociolinguists have found that code-switches frequently occur before emotional words. This pattern suggests that code-switches provide some type of benefits to bilingual comprehension. Psycholinguists have found that code-switched paragraphs increase objectivity by potentially reducing emotionality, more than passages entirely in the first or second language. Moreover, emotion regulation or reduction and code-switch comprehension result in similar neurocognitive responses. It is thus likely that code-switches help reduce bilinguals? emotional reactivity to emotional words. Two experiments will be conducted to ascertain the effect of code-switching on emotional reactivity. In the first experiment, Spanish-English bilinguals' eye-movements associated with emotional vs. neutral words embedded in Spanish, English, and code-switched sentences will be compared. The second experiment will use electroencephalography time-locked to events (Event-Related Potentials) to compare the electrophysiological signatures of emotional vs. neutral word processing in the three language conditions. The hypothesis is that the differences between emotional and neutral words would be the smallest in the code-switched sentences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One complicating factor is that the connection between DNA and traits is not consistent, and identical DNA sequences may not produce identical traits even when the environment is the same. This occurs because certain genes influence how stable or variable (robust) a trait is, with some genes producing traits that are more or less variable. Therefore, the identity of the genes that influence robustness is needed to build models to predict traits from DNA sequences. This knowledge is crucial to accelerate crop breeding, to meet growing global demands for food, and provide economic security to American producers. The current bottleneck in discovering genes that control robustness in plants is the inefficient process of measuring plant traits. To address this problem, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri has built state-of-the-art facilities and developed computer programs to automatically measure the characteristics of thousands of plants. Through extensive collaborative visits, the PI and a student trainee will use these facilities and learn methods for processing this data and how to build low-cost versions of these automated systems with the intent to bring this infrastructure to Montana. This support will enable the identification of DNA sequences that influence robustness and the relationships in robustness among characteristics.<br/><br/>Predicting phenotypes from genotypes is proving to be challenging and complex. One complicating factor is that the relationship between genotype and phenotype is problematic. While the entire genome of an organism, rather than single alleles, determines the phenotype and degree of phenotypic variability, a poor understanding of how robustness is controlled at the molecular and cellular levels remains. This knowledge gap exists because to measure robustness for any given trait, a large number of individuals with the same genetic make-up must be measured. Therefore, the objective of this fellowship is high-throughput phenotyping at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center for the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, this fellowship supports the comprehensive training of the PI and a trainee in high-throughput data collection and analyses. The data and skills gained will enable testing of the central hypothesis: genetics influences the robustness of traits in predictable ways. Specifically, the data will support identifying 1) genes modulating robustness (phenotypic variability) and 2) patterns of robustness throughout plant development. We expect that with extensive data from a model species, we will identify patterns that describe robustness for comparison across plant species, that include crops. These data will facilitate crop breeding, crucial to the NSF's mission of national security through its impacts on food and economic security. Furthermore, this fellowship will benefit Montana State University's research infrastructure through supporting the development of a low-cost automated phenotyping platform that can be utilized across crops bred in Montana. Further, hands-on demonstrations of automated phenotyping for plants will expose rural girls to computer science/engineering, fields in which women are traditionally underrepresented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central goal of the field of community ecology is to understand the outcomes of these various species interactions. Given that organismal traits govern the interactions between species, an understanding of how traits evolve in a community context is critical for a clearer picture of the dynamics of ecological communities. The aim of this research to understand the evolution of these traits in multispecies communities, and to determine if and how evolution differs in pairwise vs. more diverse species combinations. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for the study of evolution in the laboratory. By subjecting organisms with rapid generation times to selection pressures, investigators can observe evolutionary changes at both the phenotypic and genotypic level in real time. In this project, the PI will experimentally evolve predator-prey interactions between roundworms and two species of bacteria to quantify changes in their interactions. With collaborators at New York University, the PI will gain training in methods to produce and analyze genomic DNA sequence data of evolving populations of the predatory roundworms, allowing for linkages between genetic and community-level changes. Findings will further our understanding of how genetic evolution proceeds in ecological communities and contribute to our understanding of the forces structuring biodiversity across scales of organization.<br/><br/>Species interactions are a ubiquitous feature of ecological communities. As such, understanding the outcomes of these interactions provides important information for the maintenance of biodiversity. Since the outcomes of the interactions are often mediated by organismal traits, understanding how these traits, and thus interactions, evolve over time will be key to understanding biodiversity dynamics over time. Linking the underlying genetic variation to these community level phenotypes (i.e., species interactions) is the goal of this proposal.  This project will use an experimental ecological module with the model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Myxococcus xanthus (bacteria), and Escherichia coli (bacteria) to study evolving communities.  With these genetically tractable species, this project will simultaneously measure both phenotypic (ecological) and the underlying genomic changes in the DNA. Activities of this fellowship include the training of the PI in genetic and genomic analyses of Caenorhabditis nematodes, top predators in the experimental system, to link phenotypic changes in model communities to the underlying genetic changes. With collaborators at the host institution (New York University), genomic sequence data from populations of C. elegans nematodes evolved in different ecological settings will be generated and analyzed to determine how patterns of genomic evolution vary across these scenarios. Results from this research will provide insight into whether and how the genomic targets of selection are qualitatively different in pairwise vs. multispecies community interactions. The proposed research will contribute to understanding the linkages between evolutionary genetics, community ecology, and the scales of biological organization (i.e., genomics and communities).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the base deforms, so do these embedded scales, which collide and slide against each other leading to the emergence of nonlinear mechanical response and multi-functionality, not typically possible in traditional materials. This research project aims to understand and quantify this structure-property interplay with the help of analytical techniques, multi-scale computational modeling, and experimental validation. Additionally, the education and outreach plan includes several efforts: inclusion of underrepresented students via an institutional STEM center, a unique technology-science fiction event named RoboTales as part of university?s STEM day, and participation in public education via the ?modern machines? night event at the Metropolitan Science Center.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to quantify the structure-property relationships operative in a representative class of exoskeletal structures and discover universal and emergent extreme behavior. Prior work has shown that the rigid biomimetic scales on soft, initially flat substrates give rise to strain stiffening in both bending and twisting modes until a rigid ?locking? state is reached. However, little is known about the generality of these results beyond beam like substrates, limiting their application. Therefore, the PI has two hypotheses: (a) existence of universal kinematic locking?rigid locking behavior across geometry, deformation modes, and sequence and (b) extreme emergent behavior?emergence of multiaxial nonlinear response, broken symmetry with evolution of chirality and anisotropy, and localized locked modes. Testing of these hypotheses will be achieved via development of new capabilities: (i) geometrically exact nonlinear elasticity models, (ii) multi-scale finite element models, including homogenization models, spanning the exoskeleton scales (micro) and the substrate deformation (macro), and (iii) mechanics of active externally architected multi-material systems. Selected experiments with 3D digital image correlation will provide further data for understanding and validation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timescale comes from genome information assembled and compared among individuals and species. However, information on the timescale of time is scattered among thousands of articles in the scientific literature in a form that is difficult to retrieve. The TimeTree project overcomes this problem by collecting and synthesizing this information into a computational database accessible to scientists and the public. Users may obtain timetrees (trees calibrated to time) of any group, or of a custom list of species. They may also obtain a timeline showing evolutionary branches from the perspective of any selected species, going back in time to the origin of life. Events in geological and astronomical history are synchronized in the same timescale with biological timetrees and timelines, facilitating cross-disciplinary discovery. Ongoing advances in TimeTree expand on this theme by serving study data, allowing data mining by researchers, and facilitating its use as a public and educational resource.<br/><br/>The new TimeTree resource brings the fast-growing knowledge on species divergence times to researchers and the public through major technology and data expansion. This ensures access to the most up-to-date information on divergence times of species, subspecies, and populations. The expansion is accomplished with new tools and application programming interfaces to facilitate data mining, allowing comparisons among study timetrees and the synthetic timetree of life. Research exploration is facilitated by conducting common analyses in-house, such as lineages-through-time plots and diversification analyses, so that researchers may immediately see the results for any group. Maintenance costs are minimized, and sustainability is improved with new software and application programming interfaces, automating the data submission and assimilation process, and making TimeTree a sustainable community-contributed resource. TimeTree (www.timetree.org) enables researchers worldwide to query, retrieve, visualize, and explore patterns and formulate hypotheses, and improves scientific and societal return on the collective investment in evolutionary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the hotspot has progressed northeastward through time, it has ?erased? preexisting tectonic topography at rates significantly  faster than natural erosional processes and by doing so, fundamentally reshape the topographic, fluvial, and climatic evolution of an entire region.  The research will focus on the present-day southern Teton Range in northwest Wyoming, which is hypothesized to have extended farther south and was subsequently removed by the post-2 million-year eruptions of the Yellowstone caldera. In addition, the project will address the link between nascent faults and seismic activity that have formed during the actively migrating Yellowstone hotspot; thus, this project has the potential to greatly enhance the understanding of potential seismic hazards associated with the Teton fault. The Tetons and Yellowstone attract >7,000,000 visitors annually and by linking these two seemingly unrelated geologic features the investigators can provide the public with a new way of understanding one of the most unique and diverse natural landscapes in the world. The results of this research will be incorporated into new public awareness campaigns and informal public education, including visitor center exhibits, public talks, and development of a website and a series of mini-documentaries. The project will also advance desired societal outcomes by supporting advanced field and laboratory training for two doctoral students, research training and collaboration experience for at multiple undergraduate students, with an emphasis on including underrepresented minorities in STEM education. In the final year of the project, all results will be disseminated at a workshop that includes all regional stakeholders, including Teton County and Jackson city representatives, university researchers, National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the active Teton normal fault is interpreted to follow the topographic break between the range front and the adjacent Jackson Valley and this has been confirmed by recent LiDAR studies. The commonly held belief is that the fault must always be present near the topographic break at the range front, and thus slip on the northern extent of the fault is often interpreted to diminish as the topography recedes in the northern Teton Range. However; two key datasets indicate that the relict topography preserved today may not reflect the northern extent of the Teton fault, including: new data documenting the long-term fault slip and range uplift history suggests that the Teton fault may have originally extended much farther north than previously thought;  and, recently acquired LiDAR imagery reveals multiple candidate fault scarps that may represent the active northern extent of the Teton fault. To test the hypothesis that the Teton Range originally extended much farther north, the investigators are using thermochronology combined with inverse thermal history and thermal-kinematic modeling to further refine the slip history along the main segment of the Teton fault and determine the possible lengths of a northern Teton fault projection. Second, the researchers will use a grid of high-resolution seismic reflection data acquired from Jackson Lake to define how the main Teton fault links with disparate fault scarps that display similar modern offset. This survey will also allow the investigators to develop footwall and hanging wall coring targets, the products of which will be used with radiocarbon geochronology to develop an episodic fault slip history that can be compared with previous trenching studies of other fault segments both south and north of the proposed study area. Linking the timing of slip events along the main Teton fault, the lake fault segments, and the northern segments will allow the researchers to determine whether or not all of these segments are seismogenically linked. The current catalog of fault slip events is based solely on trenching studies, but it is likely that the fine-grained lake sediments preserve a more complete seismogenic record, thus providing the possibility for identifying slip events that have not been previously identified. Finally, the investigators will acquire multiple onshore fault-normal seismic reflection lines to demonstrate a northern extension of the Teton fault.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The oyster host selectively harbors a distinct composition of microorganisms (known as the microbiota) from the surrounding seawater. Despite the potential roles of microbiota in mediating host health and ecological function, little is known about their mechanism of interaction. This project will provide new insights into the diversity and function of oyster microbiota by integrating cutting-edge technologies in molecular sequencing, computational biology, and microscopic imaging. A new collaboration will be initiated between an early career faculty and her Ph.D. student at the University of Rhode Island and a leading expert in microscopy and microbiota imaging at the Marine Biological Laboratory. The research will provide new opportunities for the cross-disciplinary training of underrepresented students at a public institution of the Rhode Island (RI) jurisdiction. Due to the significant ecological and economic roles of C. virginica in coastal waters of RI, the research will also provide insights into population management by enabling future research on the mechanisms underlying the physiology, immune responses, and conservation of eastern oysters in coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>Suspension-feeding bivalves play critical roles in the nutrient dynamics, benthic-pelagic coupling, nitrogen cycling, and biomineralization in estuarine and marine ecosystems. Despite their high filtration rate, the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, maintains distinct microbiota from surrounding seawater. However, the mechanisms leading to the selective nature of the oyster microbiota is largely unknown. The proposed research aims to address this problem by applying state-of-the-art microscopic technologies into visualizing the in-situ composition and spatial organization of oyster-associated microbiota across diverse tissue types. The microscopic imaging will be integrated with shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metagenome-based reconstruction of microbial genomes to enable strain-level probe designs and functional inferences. An early career faculty and her Ph.D. student from the University of Rhode Island will take extended collaborative visits to imaging experts at the Marine Biological Laboratory to obtain trainings that would enable the specific imaging of microbial strains in host tissues. This proposal represents a first example in which high-throughput sequencing will be combined with advanced microscopy to analyze the composition, spatial organization, and function of resident microbiota associated with the eastern oyster. It will take advantage of the extensive community profiling and functional analysis performed in the team?s preliminary research, especially the genome reconstruction of novel, uncultured strains of the oyster microbiota. Combining microscopic imaging with the mining of metagenomes, the proposed project will open up new opportunities for the broad investigation of other host-microbe interactions using similar approaches, especially for non-model organisms in the estuarine and marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models make important predictions about global climate and the links to plant and microbial life on earth. Many of these models rely on simple relationships about plants on earth and their connections to the atmosphere. This CAREER award will explore new ways of developing these very important relationships and the factors (changes in soil, light, water, and more) that result in their differences. Because there is not enough information about spatial variations in vegetation and soil types, most models assume that vegetation response types vary only based on land cover types. Past research suggests that other well-known properties affect vegetation sensitivities, for e.g. how dry a particular location is, or how much clay the soil has. This CAREER award will use a new modelling framework together with satellite data to derive a map of optimal plant parameters around the world, and to test these relationships even in regions where field measurements are scarce. The research will also determine whether using these relationships can improve model predictions of how much carbon dioxide ecosystems absorb. The results of this award will improve predictions of how ecosystems respond to climatic changes by enabling more accurate predictions of carbon dioxide uptake, plant growth, and soil decomposition. Additionally, this award includes several educational components for high school students (teacher training) through undergraduates (including redesign of the material for a class, and undergraduate research experience) to post-collegiate (creating a workshop on mathematical techniques for incorporating observations into models).  <br/><br/>Large scale models of terrestrial ecosystems are one of the dominant sources of uncertainty in predictions of climate change. They have remained uncertain despite decades of effort to increase the sophistication of process representations. However, much less attention has been paid to parameter optimization. Ecosystem model parameters are assigned solely based on a handful of plant functional types, without accounting for the enormous variety of plant behavior across the globe. This project will test a new pathway for forming alternatives to plant functional types: using data assimilation. The proposed work will use the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM), which combines a simple ecosystem model, remote sensing data, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to determine ecosystem parameters that result in the most realistic fluxes and carbon pools in each pixel across the globe. The resulting parameter maps cannot be used directly in other models but will be used to test so-called environmental filtering relationships to predict ecosystem parameter variability based on other factors whose spatial variation is well known (e.g. climate, soil type, etc). This award will test whether assimilating remote sensing data in CARDAMOM can be used to derive environmental filtering relationships across the globe using  approaches similar to those from recent in situ analyses, but without relying on the quality and quantity of in situ measurements (particularly problematic in traditionally under-sampled regions like the tropics). It will also create and demonstrate the value of such relationships for heterotrophic respiration, whose spatial variability cannot be constrained by in situ measurements alone.  The educational components of the project include development of several instructional modules on topics related to ecosystem processes and climate change for middle and high school biology, chemistry, and physics teachers. The project will also be used to support a bi-annual workshop on data assimilation with CARDAMOM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have prominent roles in agricultural environments, controlling pests or being pests themselves. Ants in natural habitats comprise a major fraction of the total animal biomass and have important roles as predators, scavengers, and soil movers. Many ant species have hitchhiked into new surroundings with humans, becoming invasive species that can harm both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Ants are also renowned for their complex societies. Because of their overall importance to human interest and welfare, ants are the subjects of scientific research on a wide variety of subjects, including behavior, robotics, immunochemistry, neurobiology, development, community ecology, biology of invasive species, and sociobiology. Knowledge of the evolutionary relationships among ant species (the ""ant tree of life"") adds great value to ant study findings. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have dramatically accelerated the discovery of evolutionary relationships among plants and vertebrates. Such knowledge is currently incomplete for ants, hampering research progress. The Ants of the World project will provide a comprehensive tree of life and classification of ants. The results will also address basic questions about how life spreads and diversifies across the planet.<br/><br/>A powerful new approach for revealing evolutionary relationships among animals uses genome reduction techniques and high-throughput sequencing to obtain thousands of loci called ""UltraConserved Elements"" (UCEs). Evolutionary trees based on UCEs reliably uncover relationships at all time depths. The Ants of the World project will acquire UCE data for 4,500 ant specimens, increasing the portion of sequenced species to 96% of the 334 genera and about 45% of the 13,500 described species. Specimens will be selected to include nearly all major species groups from all terrestrial biomes. The result will be a comprehensive evolutionary tree of ants delineated to the smallest branch tips. The tree will inform a revision of all generic boundaries and deliver the long-sought goal of a stable generic classification. The tree will also be linked to geography, morphological characters, and climate data, enabling exploration of fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes. The Ants of the World project will also become a major component of Ant Course, a brief but intensive field training program in ant diversity and identification.

This proposal explores two exciting frontiers recently made available by pioneering experiments at the host institution (JILA Physics Frontier Center). First, we intend to explore how the relative orientation of approaching molecules affects the outcome of a molecular collision or chemical reaction. Second, we propose to study the properties of an artificial crystal of polar molecules in an optical lattice, an exquisite quantum-many body system recently realized experimentally at the host institution. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of how electrons behave in real materials (a key goal of modern condensed-matter physics and material science) and to novel ways to control chemical reactions with electromagnetic fields (an important goal of modern chemical physics).<br/><br/>This proposal aims to address two outstanding open problems in the physics and chemistry of cold molecular gases: (i) the lack of understanding and control of quantum stereodynamics of low-temperature  molecular collisions in the presence of external electromagnetic fields, and (ii) the nature of the phase diagram of an ultracold gas of chemically reactive polar molecules in an optical lattice recently created  for the first time at the host institution (JILA Physics Frontier Center). Using numerically exact quantum theory of molecular collisions, we propose to elucidate the effects of external fields on the stereodynamics of cold molecular collisions, with a focus on  Ne-OH collisions currently studied experimentally at JILA. We also plan, by taking advantage of recent developments in computational condensed-matter physics, to explore the phase diagram of the extended dissipative Fermi-Hubbard model of ultracold KRb molecules in a two-dimensional optical  lattice. The proposed research may lead to new ways to control the quantum dynamics of molecular  collisions and to engineer novel quantum many-body states with ultracold molecules in optical lattices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neutrons show dual particle and wave nature.  They can be described as wave packets and show interference effects like X-rays and visible light.  The primary focus of this project is to analyze and maximize the neutron interferometric beamline performances with simulations and experiments. The research team will also establish biomedical applications, which include non-invasive imaging of a bone-implant interface, to facilitate the manufacture of hip replacement implants.  Within this project, the PI aims to build a novel comprehensive simulator allowing scatter and phase-shift of neutrons, suitable for realistic neutron interferometry and verified with experiments.  The PI and a graduate trainee will perform simulations and experiments on Neutron Interferometry Imaging at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  First, a comprehensive computer simulator of neutron interferometry will be built by describing the neutron as a particle and a wave and verified. Second, special phase gratings will be investigated in simulations to improve Neutron Interferometric Tomography (NIT) performance.  Third, a bone-metal interface will be imaged using NIT.  This project will establish a strong neutron interferometric imaging program at Louisiana State University (LSU).  This project seeks to aid researchers from multiple disciplines (neutron imaging scientists and non-destructive testing application specialists) and is synergistic with Louisiana Consortium on Neutron Scattering and LSU Medical Physics.  It will establish a new research program for the PI and generate project software that will be disseminated on Github.  The future projects generated by this fellowship and collaboration with NIST will train undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs at LSU. <br/><br/>A combined Monte-Carlo and coherent wave simulation exist for X-ray interferometry but not for neutron interferometry.

Simulations and experiments on Neutron Interferometry Imaging will be conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  First, a novel, comprehensive computer simulator will be built to describe the neutron as a particle, as well as a wave, and verified.  The simulator will include Monte-Carlo based neutron scattering, coherent wave interference, and vibration effects.  The simulations will be experimentally verified using dual-phase gratings existing in the system and other high-quality neutron phase gratings that are available on loan from Louisiana State University (LSU).  The simulator will predict the far-field visibility and differential phase contrast (DPC) sensitivity at the NIST beamline as well as for two beamlines at Oakridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  This objective advances the ORNL neutron imaging and scattering research, in synergy with the goals of the Louisiana Consortium of Neutron Scattering.  Second, the conditions for ideal DPC imaging will be investigated in simulations.  Special modulated phase gratings (MPG) will be evaluated to improve Neutron Interferometric Tomography (NIT) performance.

For example, metal additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to reduce time-to-market for a new jet engine from five years to one year, while simultaneously increasing fuel efficiency and power by 10%. Poor consistency in part quality, however, limits the use of AM. As a result, safety-conscious industries (e.g., aerospace and biomedical fields) are reluctant to use AM processes to make mission-critical parts. The root cause for flaw formation in metal AM is the uneven temperature distribution inside the part during printing. To ensure a steady temperature distribution inside the part, practitioners currently use trial-and-error studies that require experimenting with different process settings and part designs ? an expensive and time-consuming approach. A more efficient solution involves encapsulating the fundamental thermal physics of the printing process using computer simulation models. These simulation models can be used to identify and correct problems that can lead to an uneven temperature distribution in the part before it is built. The PI has advanced a new mathematical approach to predict the temperature distribution in AM parts that takes less than one-tenth of the time required by existing techniques and has an error of less than 10%.  Rigorous validation of this concept with experimental data is the next step to scale this new concept to practice. <br/><br/>The objective of this fellowship is to test the hypothesis that the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature generated in a metal AM part as it is being deposited layer-upon-layer is predicted by invoking the novel theory of heat dissipation on planar graphs (spectral graph theory) with an accuracy comparable to existing finite element techniques but within a fraction of the computation time (less than 1/10th). To realize this objective, this fellowship provides the PI access to the Open Architecture Laser Powder Bed Fusion metal AM system at the Edison Welding Institute (EWI). This system has eight different sensors and allows the in-situ measurement of thermal signatures at scales ranging from 5 micrometer to 400 micrometers. Access to this unique apparatus will allow the PI to measure the instantaneous temperature distribution in a part and track changes in its shape with unprecedented precision. Using data obtained from experiments on the open architecture metal AM system at EWI, the PI will: (1) explain and an quantify the causal factors governing the temperature distribution in metal AM parts and link it to part quality; (2) achieve near real-time prediction of the temperature distribution, which will significantly reduce the experimental tests needed to optimize the part geometry and process parameters; and (3) establish the digital twin concept for qualification of metal AM parts by augmenting in-situ sensor data with physical process models.  This work will result in experimentally validated, physics-based tools to aid rapid optimization of process settings and part geometry, which in turn will shorten time-to-market for AM parts and reduce scrap rates by up to 80%.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes the applications that have driven the growth of the web like search and mail as well as new emerging applications that require machine learning.  As the demand for these services continues to grow, there is also a need to scale the computation behind them.  In the cloud, this is done by distributing the computation across many processors communicating across a high-speed network.  Unfortunately, there is an increasing performance gap that is limiting our ability to scale these cloud applications.  Processor performance has stagnated, yet network performance continues to increase exponentially to 100Gbps and beyond.   As a result, in scaling these applications, existing networking stacks are struggling to fully utilize network resources because the computational costs of network communication are too high.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to fundamentally rethink the design of server-side networking and develop new networking abstractions to address these problems.  To accomplish this goal, the plan is to develop Network Interface Card (NIC) Accelerated Active Messaging (NAAM), a new networking framework.  In NAAM, functions are written in a high-level language and then are compiled to a bytecode and verified before they are executed on a NIC.  Importantly, this new paradigm exposes the full capabilities of NICs to accelerate message processing and offload computation from the main processors while still providing a simple and expressive interface to application programmers.  The goal is to create a system that is easy to use for developers and operators while simultaneously ensuring security, performance, and scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to the National Research Council, high-quality OST programs apply the youth development framework to STEM by providing young people with rich, engaging learning experiences that couple STEM concepts with hands-on activities. These experiences apply STEM to real-world social contexts, foster youth voice and choice, build relationships with adults and peers, and support learning, thinking, interest, and identity development. Presently, there is emphasis for OST programs to focus on the development of social and emotional skills that impact all learning and performance. Social emotional skills, like perseverance, relationship building, problem-solving, and self-awareness, are also referred to as 21st-century skills, workforce skills, life skills, essential skills, or soft skills. For this conference, the term social-emotional development (SED), incorporating the above terms and social-emotional learning, will be used. There is a potentially deep and effective connection between SED and STEM, prioritizing skills that are mutually important to both fields.<br/><br/>In this virtual conference, The PEAR Institute will convene practitioners and researchers who can imagine the power of an integrated vision of STEM and SED. An important aim of this conference is to catalyze OST programs toward the intentional and explicit integration of STEM and SED in a high-quality manner. Activities by which this will happen include: (1) mapping the practice landscape of STEM-SED integration in OST to understand the interest in, capacity of, and demand for such programming; (2) documenting exemplars that illustrate explicit and intentional program integration; (3) exploring existing and potential researcher-practitioner partnerships to understand methods, data, and data systems used to capture efficacy and effectiveness of integrated STEM-SED programming; and, (4) drafting a research agenda that focuses on the quality of implementation and impact of integrated STEM-SED programming. <br/><br/>The target audience for this conference consists of professionals. Participants will represent the diversity of STEM and SED communities, including representatives of national youth-serving organizations (e.g., executives, research directors, practitioners), State Afterschool Networks (e.g., network leads, summer and afterschool practitioners, contributors to educational policy), and STEM learning ecosystems (e.g., community leads, OST practitioners, business leaders, college and university researchers). The conference format includes one short introductory session to set the stage and two longer working sessions. With input from the panelists and working group leaders, the team will produce a narrated slideshow focused on the mapping of the connections between STEM and SED to innovate assessment and data systems for research and practice. In addition to the narrated slideshow, the project team will produce two conference briefs for the field (i.e., one to two-page descriptions of findings), and an informal webinar regarding the conference outcomes.<br/><br/>This award is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

Temperatures are increasingly warmer and the region is getting progressively drier. In this study, 39 years of drought-deciduous shrub population and physiological observations (some 265,000 data points) will be synthesized to advance our understanding of how the combination of drought and El Nio events along with differences in shrub physiologies have shaped plant population structure in western deserts. Such information is important for land managers, resource specialists, and ecologists as they seek to better manage extensive arid regions of the western United States and to understand how future changes in climate will impact these arid land ecosystems. <br/><br/>The concepts synthesized in this study use data that has already been collected and will link spatial patterns of plant establishment and survival with environmental variables and intrinsic differences in the efficiency of water use by different desert shrub species. This research aims to understand how plant-plant and plant-environment interactions structure desert plant populations and how changes in climate affect these patterns. The focus of the synthesis is on observations leading to predictive constructs at three key life-history stages when population structure is affected: establishment, competition among adult individuals, and population decline under abrupt and extreme droughts. This synthesis will also generate predictions about how ecophysiological aspects of population structure will change if future climate trends follow the wet-dry pattern of the last 39 years or if the long term wet-dry cycles of the last century return. This synthesis will provide a framework for understanding how variation in plant physiology among desert plants operate at both the population and interspecific levels to affect structure of desert plant populations and how these patterns will be affected by the environmental variability already occurring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such nutritional symbioses occur frequently across many different organisms, including primates, plants, and insects. This research will investigate the joint evolutionary history of a highly successful and diverse group of insects, carpenter ants and their relatives, and the bacteria Blochmannia. Carpenter ants are the most diverse and abundant group of ants in the world - most kids have encountered them while playing outside. All carpenter ants carry Blochmannia bacteria inside their gut cells, making the bacterium an endosymbiont. Both organisms rely on one another to survive. Evidence indicates that carpenter ants and Blochmannia have maintained a close nutritional partnership for tens of millions of years. Obligate symbiotic associations among different kinds of organisms can profoundly impact the nature and tempo of the evolution of both partners, and microbial endosymbionts have been suggested to have played important roles in the diversification of some insect groups. This research will determine how the carpenter ants and their relatives evolved alongside Blochmannia. The findings will improve our understanding of how symbioses arise and are maintained in animals, with potential implications for the evolution of human-associated microbial systems. Moreover, the project will emphasize public education in ant biodiversity and microbial symbioses, and the training of early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This research will infer the phylogeny, divergence times, and biogeographic history of ants in the tribe Camponotini, and use this comparative framework to advance systematic and co-evolutionary studies of their endosymbiotic bacteria Blochmannia. Like other obligate endosymbionts, Blochmannia exhibits substantial genome reduction compared to free-living bacteria. Genome evolution and functional variation in Blochmannia will be evaluated across a phylogenetically representative selection of camponotine ants with contrasting morphological and ecological attributes. By jointly elucidating the ant and endosymbiont evolutionary histories, the project will address such questions as: (1) What are the major features of Blochmannia genome evolution across the Camponotini clade? (2) What processes shape rates and patterns of Blochmannia sequence evolution? (3) Is Blochmannia gene content variation associated with particular camponotine host attributes? By linking phylogenetic and trait data on the ants to functional genomic properties of the bacteria we will gain an understanding of the selective forces and constraints underlying this remarkable symbiosis. A detailed phylogeny of the camponotine ants will also create a strong foundation for much-needed monographic work on this taxonomically neglected group, and allow the development of more effective identification tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Where liquid water resides at the bottom of an ice sheet, it can exchange with the groundwater system. Whether the bottom of an ice sheet is frozen or melted is therefore an important control on the connection between ice and groundwater but depends on the complex ways in which water and heat pass between ice and earth systems. In this project the PI, with expertise in glacier science, will work closely with groundwater experts at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, sharing discipline-specific knowledge to overcome challenges to understanding connections between ice sheets and groundwater systems. The PI will carry out computer modeling that connects both ice sheet and groundwater systems to determine how groundwater flow influences where the bottom of the ice sheet is frozen or melted. Where a glacier or ice sheet is frozen or melted at its base controls where it can slide, and also determines where water can recharge the groundwater system. Outcomes from the project are therefore relevant to both ice sheet dynamics and groundwater flow in cold regions. The project will increase research capacity and student opportunities at University of Montana, and guest lectures to Montana high schools will benefit the local jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Water cycling in the Arctic is distinctly unique from the global hydrologic cycle due to the presence of large ice masses that source and generally drive groundwater to adjacent terrestrial and ocean systems. Linking coupling processes between ice sheet and groundwater systems, however, requires merging the knowledgebase and skillsets of a spectrum of scientific sub-disciplines. The objective of this project is to overcome discipline-specific barriers by enabling close collaboration, sharing of expertise, and educational exchange between experts in ice sheet processes and groundwater systems. Project research is focused on mass and energy feedbacks on the inland extent of melted conditions at the bottom of an ice sheet: a key problem that is highly relevant to both glaciology and hydrogeology disciplines. The problem will be addressed through novel modeling of coupled ice sheet and groundwater systems: the PI will be an early adopter of modeling packages developed by host collaborators, and generate new thermal coupling between systems. Outcomes of the project will advance understanding of heat and water fluxes across ice sheet and groundwater systems: two critical components of the Arctic that impact sea level rise, groundwater resources at the global scale, and submarine fluxes of fresh groundwater. Activities will generate new learning opportunities for students at the University of Montana, increase the institution?s research capacity, and yield jurisdictional benefits through outreach lectures to Montana high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent technological breakthroughs in, e.g., additive manufacturing and tissue engineering, have revolutionized the way materials and structures are processed, fabricated, and manufactured. By enabling the production of parts with unprecedented levels of material and geometric complexities over multiple length scales, these breakthroughs have also greatly enhanced the challenges in computational modeling and experimental testing. One of them is the quantification of part response uncertainties over complex geometries. This CAREER project aims to develop a stochastic modeling framework that will enable the automatic and robust integration of complex geometrical features into high-dimensional, predictive computational settings. This approach will pave the way for theoretical developments and virtual testing paradigms in fields where uncertainty in behavior must be quantified on real-world geometries. As part of the project, an extensive educational and outreach plan is also planned. This component notably includes: (1) hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, (2) activities to engage and educate a broad audience on basic science concepts with impactful applications, and (3) activities to increase the participation of K-12 students and underrepresented groups in computational mechanics, materials science, and STEM at large. <br/><br/>This research seeks to bridge the gap between geometrical complexity and uncertainty quantification methodologies. While there has been considerable progress in the development of probabilistic frameworks accounting for multiple sources of uncertainties in computational physics, the proper integration of complex (e.g., nonconvex) geometrical descriptions into stochastic approaches remains mostly unexplored. In this case, the characteristics of the geometrical features and the intrinsic properties of material uncertainties are intertwined through processing conditions, which uniquely challenges the state-of-the-art in stochastic modeling and uncertainty quantification. To advance new knowledge and tools, the objectives of this project include: (1) the development of appropriate probabilistic representations for a broad class of stochastic constitutive models across (spatial) scales, (2) the construction of efficient generators for sampling on complex large-scale domains, and (3) the development of robust probabilistic methodologies for model identification, propagation, and validation. To address these issues, the research will combine theoretical derivations for stochastic modeling on constrained state spaces, computational developments for random generation through fractional partial differential equations, Bayesian inference for underdetermined statistical inverse problems, and experimental characterization on additively-manufactured bone-like titanium scaffolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of all the LTER sites is to conduct policy-relevant research on ecological questions that require tens of years of data, and cover large geographical areas.  For the Palmer Antarctica LTER, the questions are centered around how the marine ecosystem west of the Antarctica peninsula is responding to a climate that is changing as rapidly as any place on the Earth. For example, satellite observations over the past 35 years indicate the average duration of sea ice cover is now ~90 days (3 months!) shorter than it was.  The extended period of open water has implications for many aspects of ecosystem research, with the concurrent decrease of Adlie penguins within this region regularly cited as an exemplar of climate change impacts in Antarctica. Cutting edge technologies such as autonomous underwater (and possibly airborne) vehicles, seafloor moorings, and numerical modeling, coupled with annual oceanographic cruises, and weekly environmental sampling, enables the Palmer Antarctica LTER to expand and bridge the time and space scales needed to assess climatic impacts. This award includes for the first time study of the roles of whales as major predators in the seasonal sea ice zone ecosystem. The team will also focus on submarine canyons, special regions of enhanced biological activity, along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP).<br/><br/>The current award's overarching research question is: How do seasonality, interannual variability, and long term trends in sea ice extent and duration influence the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling? Specific foci within the broad question include: 1. Long-term change and ecosystem transitions. What is the sensitivity or resilience of the ecosystem to external perturbations as a function of the ecosystem state? 2. Lateral connectivity and vertical stratification. What are the effects of lateral transports of freshwater, heat and nutrients on local ocean stratification and productivity and how do they drive changes in the ecosystem? 3. Top-down controls and shifting baselines. How is the ecosystem responding to the cessation of whaling and subsequent long-term recovery of whale stocks? 4. Foodweb structure and biogeochemical processes. How do temporal and spatial variations in foodweb structure influence carbon and nutrient cycling, export, and storage? The broader impacts of the award leverage local educational partnerships including the Sandwich, MA STEM Academy, the New England Aquarium, and the NSF funded Polar Learning and Responding (PoLAR) Climate Change Education Partnership at Columbia's Earth Institute to build new synergies between Arctic and Antarctic, marine and terrestrial scientists and students, governments and NGOs. The Palmer Antarctic LTER will also conduct appropriate cross LTER site comparisons, and serve as a leader in information management to enable knowledge-building within and beyond the Antarctic, oceanographic, and LTER communities."

It follows that understanding protein structure and function is essential to understanding life processes, and how to control or modify them. Biochemistry and biophysics experiments give the most accurate data on protein structure and function, but the experiments are often expensive and too specialized for many of the cell and molecular biologists focused on a particular interesting protein. This means that reliable computational predictions of protein structure and function are in high demand. These techniques are also specialized but can be automated, which is the focus of this project, which aims to develop an integrated platform for high-resolution protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation that is accessible from the Web. This resource will significantly enhance studies of individual proteins as well as processes in cellular biology and other biological sciences. Through the collaboration of the two institutions, students at NCAT will learn state of the art high performance computing methods, and workshops at both institutions will provide greater understanding of the capabilities of the new resource. <br/><br/>Proteins are complex components of biological systems, and studies on their structure and function often require multiple approaches to measurement or modeling. Many of the advanced computer algorithms used in this modeling are highly specialized, involving a number of complicated processes for each aspect of the protein modeling. Biologists whose primary interest is the final result often cannot determine which algorithm or pipeline to choose, how to enter parameters, or how to interpret the resulting models. While continuing to improve the accuracy of the core algorithms in protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation, this project will also make improvements to domain parsing and assembly, to improve the quality of complex protein structure and function modeling. Another major focus of this project is to develop new protocols that automatically guide protein targets to the most suitable pipelines. In conjunction with this there will be new confidence scoring systems, both global and local, to assist biological users as they interpret the modeling results. In addition, advanced parallel computing and graphic processor unit techniques will be implemented in order to accelerate the pipelines and reduce user's waiting time.  New opportunities will be made for improving educational outcomes, in particular for women and minority students, in both University of Michigan and the North Carolina A&T State University.

The objective of this research is to create a framework for application of middle-of-life product data toward making sustainable product end-of-use recovery and reuse/recycle/etc. decisions. The framework to be developed has three main components: 1) Data collection: the definitions of different types of data that are generated over the middle-of-life phase of the product, particularly from the consumers' usage behavior, and also the types of uncertainty included in the data; 2) Data analytics: the evaluation of future reusability of consumer electronics based on usage profiles; and 3) Decision-making techniques: the identification of the best End of Use (EOU) options (e.g., reuse, recycle, remanufacture, refurbish, and disposal) not only based on product reusability, but also planned-obsolescence and market acceptance. Several application areas will be studied with the help of an industry partner. The focus will be on collecting consumer usage data for charge and discharge usage of lithium-ion laptop batteries and Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) data from home-run and office-run personal computers. This research is targeted to allow information flow to go beyond the first product lifecycle and to feed the information gathered in the first lifecycle to remanufacturing decisions being made at the start of the future lifecycles. Particularly, a prognostic method will be developed that predicts the future reusability of different components of a product, aggregates the data together and further optimizes the appropriate EOU option.<br/><br/>The research will include three major activities: 1) Characterizing product usage behavior of consumers to identify general product usage patterns. Data will be collected from surveys and information collected by industry partners on the specific category of electronic devices to quantify the conditions under which  certain electronics have been used; 2) Creating a new class of predictive modeling techniques to quantify the future reusability of products based on the lifecycle profile and consumer usage behavior, and developing a set of decision models in the form of prognostic algorithms to determine the best EOU recovery option for used products incorporating the reusability assessment as well as the information from product technical life, market life, design life and physical life; and finally 3) Evaluating the proposed decision-making methods. This research has potential in facilitating the reusability of consumer electronics. These practices are essential for responding to the growing global hunger for electronic devices in newly industrialized countries that lack the sufficient systems, policies and infrastructure for appropriate management and recovery of electronic waste (e-waste).

Recently, seismologists have recognized that subduction megathrust faults undergo slip in episodic ?slow slip events?. Prior to the discovery of slow slip events in the last decade, our paradigms of fault slip were focused on seismic slip in major earthquakes. Since the discovery of slow slip, most studies have focused on deep (>20-40 km depth) slow slip events, but we now realize that shallow slow slip events (<5-15 km depth) exist that are much more accessible to near-source investigations. These shallow slow fault slip events are centered beneath the ocean so onshore instruments have not been able to measure how much surface deformation occurs. This study takes advantage of planned International Ocean Discovery Program drilling to install sensors in two boreholes that will measure properties indicative of change in the shallow crust that the episodic fault activity causes.  Senior researchers in borehole instrumentation will mentor mid-early career scientists, passing along extensive knowledge of such complex implementation and research. Japanese, New Zealand, and German collaborators will participate with the US investigators in this international study, and local communities will benefit from scientist outreach associated with cruises off New Zealand. This study is being undertaken as a ?community proposal?, whereby all data will be immediately publicly available.<br/> <br/>The shallowest, well-documented slow slip events on Earth occur at the northern Hikurangi margin, offshore Gisborne, New Zealand, at <5-15 km depth. They recur approximately every 1-2 years, with slip on the plate boundary interface of up to 15-20 cm. The unusually close proximity of the Gisborne slow slip events to the seafloor, the large slow slip event magnitudes (equivalent to an earthquake magnitude Mw ~6.3-6.8), and short recurrence intervals makes this the ideal setting for evaluating the near-source hydrological, geochemical, and thermal response of the offshore subduction margin to large, frequent, well-documented deformation transients. The borehole observatory data will clarify the role that fluid pressures, fluid flow, and temperature play in the occurrence of slow slip events, as well as the influence of slow slip event deformation on fluid and geochemical cycling within the forearc. This project will establish the borehole facility and set-up open data access. Analysis of the first two years of data, recovered by ROV, will evaluate the deformation, hydrological, and geochemical responses near the source of slow slip, as well as document the thermal regime of shallow slow slip. One of the borehole installations will target the region surrounding the shallow portion of the megathrust fault , while sensors in a second borehole will target the over-riding plate ~5 km above the slow slip event source."

In particular, those leaders with decision-making authority over budget, personnel and policy (e.g., deans) can either be gatekeepers or gateways to promoting the success of these efforts. A recent review makes the case for the need to develop shared leadership models in higher education to more effectively solve the increasingly complex problems facing colleges and universities. However, there is no clear definition of the skills required to lead using this type of model, nor are there manuals, workshops or other resources to help leaders develop these competencies. <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will bring together positional leaders to reflect on both their experience and the current leadership development literature to define the set of distinctive competencies required to lead scalable, sustainable systemic institutional change. These competencies will be defined and then used as the basis for building resources that will be geared toward developing these competencies in positional leaders across the country. The set of competencies will be published in a summary article and used to create a plan for the development of leadership program resources. Participants will also contribute to the development of resources that can be made widely available for higher education leadership programs offered through higher education associations and other organizations. This will develop leaders who can more effectively implement, scale and sustain institutional change efforts geared towards improving undergraduate Biology student access, persistence and graduation of underrepresented minority students. This work may also lead to additional workshops to develop corresponding competencies for faculty, staff and students who are participants in campus change projects. Finally, this work will contribute to the development of new research questions regarding how well leaders who have been exposed to the new resources exhibit the competencies and use them to more effectively lead campus change efforts.

Coastal groundwater is especially vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise due to the potential for seawater intrusion into groundwater aquifers. Seawater intrusion has reduced water supply in all coastal regions of the US. This has resulted in high costs to society. Groundwater affected by seawater intrusion requires expensive desalination processes to be made drinkable, while irrigation water could be rendered unusable leading to the abandonment of farmland. Future climate projections suggest the problem of seawater intrusion will worsen. However, the scale of the problem is unclear, making it difficult to devise responses. While computer models of coastal groundwater aquifers can be useful for predicting seawater intrusion, these modeling efforts challenge the capability of even the fastest computers. We propose to address this challenge by developing models that are orders of magnitude faster than current models. This will allow for a much broader consideration of potential solutions. These modeling advances will be made in collaboration with water supply agencies, with the goal of increasing the utility of groundwater modeling for coastal communities. Successful development and adoption of these approaches will help agencies tasked with the protection of coastal aquifers devise sustainable management strategies to protect scarce water resources.<br/><br/>Solutions to seawater intrusion problems involve combinations of more efficient pumping schemes, demand reduction, and technological interventions such as desalination. However, determining optimal solutions for these problems poses extreme computational demands. This project will greatly advance the development and application of simulation-optimization (SO) by developing computationally efficient, robust, and accurate surrogate models for coastal groundwater systems. The limited literature on SO and surrogate modeling in seawater intrusion problems has focused on simplified hydrogeological settings and mathematical representations of management strategies. However, realistic seawater intrusion problems involve hydrogeological complexities, including discrete lithological facies, faults and fractures, and saltwater-freshwater mixing zone dynamics. Solutions necessitate nonlinear objective functions and continuous and discrete decision variables, representing a wide range of engineering components. We hypothesize that these hydrogeologic and management features determine the building of accurate and efficient surrogates, and accurate surrogate SO models for seawater intrusion problems can be at least an order of magnitude faster than full-scale models. The reduction in computational effort will allow us to investigate a broader range of potential sea level rise and climate change impacts and a wider range of potential management responses to these impacts. To achieve this goal, the specific project objectives are to: i) develop SO test problems to provide robust evaluation of model surrogates; ii) formulate management objectives and constraints based on management of the test case aquifers, and identify scenarios relevant to the test cases; and iii) program, train, and evaluate the performance of ?data-driven? and ?model-driven? surrogates to identify optimal management schemes for the test case aquifers, a range of sea level rates, climatology, and groundwater demand scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As ocean sediments accumulate on the seafloor they record the ambient magnetic field and thereby provide an important record of past geomagnetic behavior. Many of the existing high quality records that span the last 2-3 million years are from North Atlantic Ocean sediments, which represents a narrow, and maybe even unique, magneto-geographical range.  To properly represent the global field and its variability requires records from other regions of the globe for the same time period. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 363 to the West Pacific Warm Pool drilled nine equatorial sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and recovered a total of 7km of ocean sediment core. Preliminary measurements suggest two of these sites, U1486 and U1489, contain high quality magnetic records that can be used to investigate and understand the behavior of Earth's magnetic field over the last 1.25 (U1486) and 5 (U1489) million years. This project seeks to measure the magnetism of these sediments to develop and refine high resolution records of Earth's recent magnetic field behavior and compare them to North Atlantic records. The project will also develop the longest continuous relative paleomagnetic intensity time-series to date back to the earliest Pliocene (~5 million years ago). In addition, these paleomagnetic records will provide a chronological framework for related detailed isotope and climate studies for the region.  In terms of broader impacts and outreach, this project will directly support the training and development of a post-doc as the principal investigator and will expose undergraduate students from Oregon State University to basic research methods and concepts. There will be special attention placed on undergraduates being involved in original research, the development of project ""ownership"" for undergraduate students, and in recruiting a diverse team of researchers.<br/><br/>Paleomagnetic records derived from relatively high sedimentation rate marine cores in the North Atlantic strongly inform and define our current understanding of paleomagnetic secular variation and relative paleointensity (RPI). Replication of records from within this basin argue for RPI variations that have a global expression and reflect stochastic variations in the intensity of the dipolar field. This assumption is likely true, however, it has never explicitly been tested, in part due to a lack of records from different regions of the globe that have a similar resolving ability (i.e. sedimentation rate) to those in the North Atlantic. We will take u-channel samples from the archives halves of U1486 and U1489 and measure the magnetic susceptibility and demagnetization behaviors of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM), anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) at centimeter scale. We will use these data to generate characteristic remanent directions and generate estimates of RPI over long Pleistocene and Pliocene timeframes. The 1.25 Myr equatorial Pacific marine sediment record from Site U1486 can be queried for evidence of non-axial-dipole structure and regional heterogeneities at a resolution several times higher than existing records and stacks and is more similar to high quality North Atlantic records. Site U1489 contains a 5 Myr record of sedimentation that will be developed into the longest continuous RPI record ever produced. Preliminary data suggest it is of remarkable fidelity and, when paired with the d18O benthic foraminifer stratigraphy being developed concurrently for this site, can potentially become the type record for Pliocene geomagnetic field behavior. Not only will this record be a magnetostratigraphic tuning target for the Pliocene, it will also inform inquiries into geomagnetic field evolution and organization over the scale of (sub-)orbital variations to full chrons and epochs. RPI-assisted chronologies will be developed for the mid-late Pleistocene records of both U1486 and U1489 (through correlation to existing global stacks) that can then be tandemly tuned with d18O records to develop robust chronologies and the establishment of a strong chronostratigraphic framework to directly facilitate the science objectives of IODP Expedition 363."

Power management is increasingly important to the battery lifetime and thermal management of mobile systems whose computational heart, a system-on-a-chip (SoC), often integrates tens and hundreds of components and billions of transistors. Existing systems reply on device drivers for runtime PM.  A device driver is a software program that controls a particular type of hardware device attached to a computer.   This approach to PM not only leads to unoptimized, or often complete absence of runtime PM in widely used mobile systems, but also incurs high overhead by engaging the high-power central processing unit (CPU). The goal of this project is to relieve device drivers and the CPU of runtime PM by completely rethinking runtime PM of mobile SoCs. First, it will investigate a novel architecture in which a single operating system entity reasons whether a SoC component is idle without involving its device driver.  Second, the project will contribute to operating system support such that the runtime PM logic can be entirely realized on an ultra-low-power computing core available in modern mobile systems. The project will prototype and evaluate its technical innovations with Android/Linux-based testbeds and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based SoC prototyping hardware.<br/><br/>The project will leverage collaborations with industry leaders to ensure a timely transfer of technologies into industry and a broad impact on the commercial development of mobile systems and their SoCs. The project will provide new modules for teaching mobile and embedded systems and a platform to engage high-school and minority students. As mobile systems are providing access to information technologies to underserved populations and being adopted for professional uses, by improving their battery lifetime and therefore usability, the project will have a positive socio-economic impact globally.  Research results will be published in academic conferences and journals.

As such, Nd is recognized as a ""quasi-conservative"" tracer. Implicit in this ""quasi-conservative"" behavior is the assumption that no significant source of Nd exists along the water mass flowpath. This is the basic principle behind using Nd isotopes archived in marine sediments as a tracer of past ocean circulation. In recent years, several studies of Nd sources, sinks, and biogeochemical cycling has challenged this conventional wisdom and proposed additional sources of Nd, such as: (i) exchange with particulates that modifies seawater Nd isotope ratios, or (ii) addition of pore water Nd influenced by reactions with sediment. To successfully use Nd isotopes as a water mass tracer proxy, it is essential to understand these limitations. Therefore, this project will examine these alternative sources (and sinks) of Nd to evaluate their impact on the quasi-conservative behavior of seawater Nd. This research will help to constrain the limitations of Nd isotopes as a tracer of past ocean circulation. Funding supports career development for a postdoctoral researcher, provides field experience for a graduate student, and provides research experience for an undergraduate student.<br/><br/>Project investigators will collect samples that constitute the different components of modern Nd cycle (e.g., filtered seawater, water column particulates, pore waters and concurrent down hole sediment samples) during a cruise in the Southeast Indian-Southern Ocean (SEISO). The SEISO cruise track will: (i) cover major water masses of Southern Ocean origin (Antarctic Mode Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, Upper and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water), (ii) extensively transit over the southeast Indian Ridge, and (iii) sample the region just north of the Subantarctic Front, where Subantarctic Mode Water is forming today. Seawater and pore water Nd isotopes and Rare Earth Elements will be analyzed, thereby allowing characterization of the Southern Ocean water masses, the effects on seawater Nd isotopes from potentially reactive ridge rocks, and the influence of pore water Nd flux on bottom water Nd isotopes. Besides improving the understanding of Nd cycling, data from this project will provide important information for interpreting other datasets from the research cruise, and will be of interest to a wide range of climate scientists as well as biogeochemical modelers, chemical and biological oceanographers, and polar scientists."

The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. infrastructure a grade of D+, with a 10 year funding gap of $1.44 trillion, leading to losses of $3.9 trillion to the U.S. GDP and 2.5 million fewer jobs. FRP composites and geosythentics are gaining acceptance for infrastructure due to their corrosion resistance, ease of installation, and proof-of-concept from field demonstrations in service for up to four decades. The biggest advantage to composite materials is durability, as they do not corrode or rot allowing for an extended service life thus extending taxpayer dollars.  With the support of NSF, CICI currently consists of a consortium of four universities and 31 industry members, bringing together faculty, students, practitioners, manufacturers, trade organizations and government agencies to overcome the obstacles to widespread deployment of composites, forging lasting partnerships, and educating students, engineers and contractors. <br/><br/>CICI focuses on four research thrusts. First, research on material development, manufacturing, and characterization allows for the development of new composite materials and recycling of discarded polymer composites with a clear understanding of the physico-chemical and mechanical properties. Second, the durability and aging of composites is evaluated under accelerated aging and by examining existing structures to ensure that composites can have long service lives under harsh environmental conditions. Third, design, implementation and evaluation of composites in new construction and rehabilitation of existing structures.. Fourth, CICI contributes to the development of standards, specifications, and guide documents required for the deployment of new technologies into commercial practice. The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will continue to examine the utilization of composites, including geosynthetics, polymeric materials including geopolymers, and other geocomposites in subsurface infrastructure including pavements, runways, embankments, retaining structures, earth dams and levees. Both life cycle cost analysis and sustainable utilization of composites will be addressed in these studies. The UTA CICI site has a strong research background in soil-structure interactions, and will work with the partner universities on materials, structural retrofits and offshore soil treatment including geosynthetics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an increasingly competitive global environment, American competitiveness often depends on analyzing the best available data and evidence in ways that are rigorous and actionable. Our military, our farms, our factories, our tech companies, and our governments benefit from analyses that document the effect of past and current programs and provide a credible basis for improving future effectiveness and efficiency. The EITM (Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models) program is designed to help young scholars develop research designs in ways that advance critical scientific knowledge and that make that knowledge more relevant and usable to the private and public sector. EITM pursues these goals by providing opportunities for scholars to better leverage possible intersections between theoretical modeling and empirical inference. For example, today sophisticated methods for examining qualitative data, text, ""big data"", networks and related phenomena are drawing scholars' attention. EITM his attention increases the opportunities for, and headwinds facing, theory-empirical integrations. A new approach to EITM can help scholars increase the credibility and value of the knowledge that they are now producing.<br/><br/>The EITM Summer Institutes offer younger scholars an opportunity to work with senior scholars who are leaders in advancing theoretical and empirical research. The content of Institute activities pertains to the development and expansion of best practices. The substantive focus is on areas where appreciable research integrating theory and methods already exists. Institute activities transcend passive receipt of lecture material. Each institute offers participants multiple dynamic opportunities to receive mentoring and feedback from a wide range of sources. Each institute combines a rigorous curriculum with a wide range of one-to-one mentoring opportunities with leading faculty from across the country. EITM is committed to making these opportunities available to people from all backgrounds. We have worked with other groups to deal with the fact that aspiring members of historically underrepresented populations often desire the benefits of an EITM experience, but lack confidence that their institutions have adequately prepared them. EITM's expanded Scholarship program gives us the ability to be proactive in building new opportunity pipelines for such individuals. In short, EITM emphasizes addressing important substantive and methodological problems with a combination of clearly-stated premises, logically coherent theory explaining relations among concepts named in the premises, and a logically coherent empirical work developed to evaluate the premises and/or the relations. Society benefits when its members can develop, articulate, and apply logically-coherent and empirically robust explanations of critical social phenomena. Dealing with such questions directly, as EITM does, is a means to new levels of accuracy and reliability for the growing range of private and public sector entities that use social science to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. Developing a generation of scholars who are up to helping the nation effectively confront its most significant challenges and to make the most of its evolving opportunities is the main goal of the EITM approach."

This project is developing a collection of tools to assist in the productive development of high-performance software for GPUs, so that the barrier to effective use of GPUs by the scientific community can be lowered.<br/><br/>A central idea being pursued in this research is the identification of primary hardware resource bottlenecks that limit performance of a GPU kernel, to guide the modification of the kernel in a manner that seeks to alleviate the identified bottleneck. Abstract kernel emulation along with sensitivity analysis with respect to hardware resource latency/throughput parameters are used for bottleneck identification. Three usage scenarios are targeted: (1) OpenMP offload, (2) domain-specific code generators, and (3) CUDA/OpenCL kernels.  The offload model introduced in OpenMP 4.0 is an attractive approach for transforming existing legacy codes as well as for newly developed codes, to facilitate productivity and portability. Domain-specific library generators exploit pattern-specific semantics in order to perform optimizing transformations that are beyond the scope of general-purpose optimizing compilers. Tensor contractions and stencils are two domains of particular emphasis.

The project would also help develop new curriculum and train US workforce in the important area of information security and would be inclusive of the women, minority, and underrepresented groups in this endeavor.<br/><br/>This project develops a new methodology for attack-aware design for safety-critical cyber-physical and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. A formal, multilayer model is used to describe the system. New design-time re-synthesis methods analyze the system for potential attacks and modify the system to mitigate the attacks. The methodology considers both functional attacks and timing-oriented quality-of-service attacks. Mitigations may be applied at multiple levels: middleware, operating system, and hardware. Attack mitigation is posed as an optimization problem. A set of mitigations is selected based on cost and on the number of mitigations applied for each valid computation. The methodology is applicable to networked systems at multiple scales, including both multiprocessor systems-on-chips used in smartphones and networked control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies show creating more equal educational opportunities in the K-12 education system is an effective, socially just approach to expanding STEM participation. This study examines the impact of Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (T-STEM) academies on (a) STEM teacher labor markets and (b) students' educational and workforce outcomes. T-STEM academies are public high schools focused on improving instruction and academic performance in science and mathematics-related subjects and expanding the number of students entering STEM careers, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM fields. Analyses draw on a statewide longitudinal student-level dataset covering all students in Texas over a 20-year period. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project objectives are three-fold. First, the study documents whether students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields have equitable access to high-quality STEM teachers across classrooms, schools, and districts. Although prior studies identify a teacher quality gap where disadvantaged students are assigned to less qualified and less effective teachers, no prior studies explore exposure to highly-qualified STEM teachers for advantaged and disadvantaged youth. Second, the study analyzes whether T-STEM academies reduce the STEM teacher quality gap. The third aim of the study is to assess the impact of T-STEM academies on student achievement in math, science, and reading, the likelihood of high school graduation, postsecondary enrollment and completion, as well as students' labor market earnings and the likelihood of employment in a STEM field."

Pathogens that survive this first line of defense are met by a second line of defense that results in a higher amplitude programmed cell death response, which effectively sequesters some pathogens in foci of dead cells. However, in the case of necrotrophic pathogens, the class of plant pathogens that acquire nutrients from dead tissue, this defense response is hijacked and utilized by the pathogen to further disease proliferation, translating to crop failure. The project will fill knowledge gaps in the understanding of how plants perceive this important class of pathogens and how immunity responses result in a positive outcome for the plant host (disease resistance). Thus, the project will contribute to understanding of how plant immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens which is important as they are becoming well known for their roles in causing disease on important crops and are significantly contributing to world food security issues. The information generated will transect multiple pathosystems important to crop production through characterizing and defining the mechanism that regulates host signaling and immunity against diverse pathogens. The molecular genetic and genomic data generated and molecular tools developed, will broadly benefit the plant-microbe interactions scientific community as well as answer fundamental questions that will facilitate the deployment of genetic resistance in crops contributing to a more secure food supply. This research will also be used in cross-disciplinary training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students in molecular genetics and molecular plant pathology from both the host and pathogen perspective. A collaborative outreach program developed through this grant will involve education of young Native American scientists in order to effectively recruit them into the scientific fields effectively broadening the participation of the most under represented group in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis is that early immunity responses are effective at stopping the necrotrophic pathogens, yet later elicited immunity responses result in programmed cell death that is effectively hijacked by the necrotophic specialists to complete their lifecycle, contributing to disease susceptibility. The two specific objectives to test this hypothesis focus on a comprehensive evaluation of the temporally and spatially distinct immunity and virulence responses from the host (barley) and pathogen (Pyrenophora teres f. teres), respectively. These aims will address fundamental questions: 1) is a diverse receptor-like protein targeted by multiple necrotrophic effectors to elicit necrotrophic effector triggered susceptibility (NETS); and 2) does a highly effective dominant resistance gene activate early defense responses, arresting the necrotrophic specialist before it colonizes and deploys its necrotrophic effector repertoire? The first component of the plant immune system investigated is a highly variable receptor-like protein, Spt1, which is targeted by multiple diverse necrotrophic effectors located throughout the genomes which evolved to incite disease. This receptor contains unprecedented variability at a localized region that correlates with specific susceptibilities, suggesting that the pathogen populations continually evolved to target this unknown domain and the host has been undergoing a high level of diversifying selection at this domain to evade pathogen virulence. The information gathered on the receptor and necrotrophic effectors will fill fundamental gaps in the knowledge of how necrotrophic specialists target the host and manipulate a weak link in its immune system to cause disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this regard, storing and manipulating information in magnetic devices is promising. This is because, unlike CMOS devices, information in magnetic devices can be stored without any energy dissipation, while energy is needed only to read or write information. This low-power operation of magnetic devices is highly advantageous for applications such as Internet of Things and intelligent sensing that have low operating power requirements. This research will connect the physics of such magnetic devices with their use in circuits in which magnetic devices co-exist with and complement silicon devices for enhanced functionality and user experience. Results from this research will be incorporated into a hands-on circuit design workshop organized annually at New York University (NYU). Specifically, students will learn about the physics of magnets in table top experiments and interactive online learning tools. The project will also develop content on magnetic memory that will be introduced in a course on nanoelectronics devices and circuits taught annually at NYU. The project will also publicly release the device models and simulation data generated in this research via the science and engineering gateway hosted at Purdue University, known as the nanoHUB, to benefit researchers and educators working in related fields.<br/><br/>While other possibilities exist, this particular project will focus on two specific magnetic devices, namely the voltage-controlled topological-spin switch (vTOPSS) and the magneto-electric spin-orbit (MESO) device. These magnetic devices offer 10 to 100 times superior energy efficiency for binary operations compared to their magnetic counterparts. Another unique feature of these devices is that their logic functionality can be configured post-fabrication, which translates into resilience and area- and power benefits at the circuit and system level. Physics-based models of the latency, energy dissipation, thermal stability, and error-rate of vTOPSS and MESO device will be developed and calibrated against large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations. Impact of potential interconnects, including metallic and semiconducting nanowires, on device performance will be quantified. Device-level models will be used to develop a standard cell library of Boolean logic gates with vTOPSS and MESO as the switching elements. The cell library will enable the quantification of performance metrics of magnetic-CMOS computing platform at scale.

The overarching goal of this project is to obtain a refined understanding of these inference tasks from both statistical and computational perspectives. The questions addressed in this project arise from pressing challenges faced in modern data analysis.

These include designing efficient algorithms that are stable in the presence of deviations from the assumed model, circumventing the curse of dimensionality in distribution learning, and testing high-dimensional probabilistic models. This set of directions could lead to new algorithmic and probabilistic techniques, and offer insights into the interplay between structure and efficiency in unsupervised estimation.

Fungi are critical members of most ecosystems. Many fungi produce a diversity of secondary metabolites, chemical compounds that have important roles in their defense, communication between individuals of the same species, and communication between different species. Fungal secondary metabolites have also been used by humans for biomedical and agricultural applications, such as the antibiotic penicillin, the fungicide strobilurin, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin. However, identifying these compounds and understanding their ecological function remains difficult and labor intensive. This research project aims to implement new approaches for isolating and studying the chemicals produced by fungi, using methods including gene activation and metabololite profiling. These experiments contribute to an improved understanding of the complex chemical ecology of fungi. This work also has potential to identify novel secondary metabolites with practical applications.  The Loesgen Lab regularly participates in OSU's Discovery Days, a semiannual education fair that serves 3500 children from schools around Oregon. This project expands the lab's collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) and establishes an interactive exhibit that introduces children and their parents to natural products chemistry. Microbial chemistry is an interdisciplinary field with important ecological applications, and is thus very well positioned to serve as a vehicle for chemistry education. This team participates in the Chemistry Undergraduate Mentorship and Empowerment (ChUME) Initiative at<br/>OSU. ChUME enhances undergraduate student success by providing students with a strong professional support network and personal mentoring.<br/><br/>Three prominent challenges in modern microbial chemistry are driving expression of silenced gene clusters, identifying novel secondary metabolites, and understanding the ecological role of identified compounds. Dr. Loesgan and her group will study the environmental, chemical, and epigenetic perturbation in fungi to access previously repressed secondary metabolites. They will investigate metabolomics methods used to rapidly identify newly expressed natural products and integrate metabolomics methods with bioassay data to enable the elucidation of the ecological role of secondary metabolites. Aim 1 establishes a method for de-repressing gene clusters using a novel class of chemical epigenetic modifying agents. Aim 2 uses metabolomics methods to analyze liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS), high performance two-dimensional NMR, and RNA expression data in order to detect and isolate newly expressed secondary metabolites. Aim 3 tests secondary metabolites for effects on bacterial, fungal, and plant growth in order to determine the likely ecological role of these molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.<br/>  <br/>Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines."

Alaska has roughly fifty-four historically active volcanoes with multiple explosive eruptions per year that threaten local populations, infrastructure, and air traffic. For example, the 1989-1990 eruption of Redoubt volcano caused failure of all four engines of a commercial jet, resulting in more than two vertical miles of airplane free-fall. Fortunately in that instance the aircraft made a safe landing, but accurate forecasting of volcanic eruptions remains challenging many years later. Accurate volcanic eruption forecasting is hampered by the complex and dynamic nature of volcanoes. Recent studies, however, have shown that combining multidisciplinary observations of past unrest can yield accurate forecasts of eruptions from well-monitored volcanoes. In this project the re-analysis and combination of multidisciplinary observations of past volcanic unrest for eight Alaska volcanoes will help to develop a suite of eruption forecast models. These models will be provided to the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) for operational use to improve AVO's eruption forecasting capabilities and mitigate eruption hazards. Additionally, by developing and sharing education modules and courses with teachers from communities near active volcanoes, the populations most directly impacted by volcanic eruptions will be better prepared.<br/><br/>This project will capitalize on the wealth of AVO data, the multidisciplinary expertise of volcano observatory scientists, and the analytical power provided by a team of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and researchers. Our target Alaska volcanoes encompass a range of eruptive behaviors and signs of unrest. Through data reanalysis and multidisciplinary synthesis we will advance our understanding of these dynamic systems and identify commonalities in unrest signatures. Our project will build valuable eruption models for each target volcano, including one complex physics-based model and eight multicomponent ensemble models. These models will be used as input parameters into a probabilistic eruption forecasting framework that will incorporate geologically-derived eruption histories, geophysical and geochemical monitoring data, and expert elicitation to forecast the possible eruption outcomes and threats. This project will advance our understanding of the fundamental processes that lead to volcanic unrest or eruption and improve our capabilities to forecast eruptions and mitigate associated hazards. These results will be applicable to a range of volcanoes worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is evidence that ISL experiences can expand opportunities for youth learning and development in STEM, for instance, increase positive attitudes towards educational aspirations and future careers/pursuits, improve grades and test scores in school settings, and decrease disciplinary action and dropout rates. Through research and development, this project brings together researchers and practitioners to focus on the experiences, practices and tools that will support equitable youth pathways into STEM. Working across conceptual frameworks and ISL settings (e.g. science centers, community groups, zoos) and universities in four urban contexts in two different nations, the partnership will produce a coherent knowledge base that strengthens and expands research plus practice partnerships, builds capacity towards transformative research and development, and develops new models and tools in support of equitable pathways into STEM at a global level. This project is funded through Science Learning+, which is an international partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Wellcome Trust with the UK Economic and Social Research Council. The goal of this joint funding effort is to make transformational steps toward improving the knowledge base and practices of informal STEM experiences. Within NSF, Science Learning+ is part of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that seeks to enhance learning in informal environments and to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences. <br/><br/>This Equity Pathways project responds to three challenges at the intersections of ISL research and practice in the United States and the United Kingdom: 1) lack of shared understanding of how youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds perceive and experience ISL opportunities across national contexts, and the practices and tools needed to support empowered movement through ISL; 2) limited shared understanding and evidence of core high-leverage practices that support such youth in progressing within and across ISL, and 3) limited understanding of how ISL might be equitable and transformative for such youth seeking to develop their own pathways into STEM. The major goal of this Partnership is for practitioners and researchers, working with youth through design-based implementation research, survey and critical ethnography, to develop new understandings of how and under what conditions they participate in ISL over time and across settings, and how they may connect these experiences towards pathways into STEM. The project will result in: 1) New understandings of ISL pathways that are equitable and transformative for youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds; 2) A set of high leverage practices and tools that support equitable and transformative informal science learning pathways (and the agency youth need to make their way through them); and 3) Strengthened and increased professional capacity to broaden participation among youth from historically underrepresented backgrounds in STEM through informal science learning.

The games will be designed to capture working memory, spatial reasoning, response time, and hand-eye coordination skills tailored for the target population. The integrated computational measures of play complexity will enable the system to automatic adjust the game difficulty based on the user performance. The system will not only automate the administration and data collection process, but also produce new types of behavioral data, such as hand tremor, repetitive or hyperactive motions, and manipulation speed. The proposed technology development and evaluation will take the co-design approach in order to effectively address user-specific requirements and technical improvements for potential commercialization. A partnership with a local continuing care retirement community (CCRC) will streamline and accelerate the complex co-design process via utilizing the living lab established in the partnering CCRC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study of curvature is important in all domains of science and engineering. For example, the theory of general relativity posits that gravity curves space and time in a mathematically precise manner, while in materials science, the meeting points between crystal structures are modeled by (a rather different notion of) curvature. This project is concerned with the study of a particular measure of bending called scalar curvature. Scalar curvature is one of the simplest measures of bending, but due to this simplicity scalar curvature can contain only a limited amount of information. Hence, we must study scalar curvature through highly indirect means. One way to explore scalar curvature is in relation to the isoperimetric problem: in a given space, how can we enclose the largest amount of volume with the smallest perimeter? This is one of the oldest mathematical questions, but its link to scalar curvature is only recently beginning to be understood. The PI's project will continue the study of scalar curvature as it affects the large-scale behavior of area and volume, with particular emphasis on the relationship between such topics and problems related to general relativity. In addition to this research, this project will also support the PI's continued efforts to promote student learning and training through seminar organization, conferences, and summer schools, as well as expository articles and notes.  <br/><br/>A major component of the research plan is the continued study of the link between large-scale variational problems and scalar curvature, motivated by geometric and physical considerations such as the Penrose inequality and static uniqueness questions from general relativity. To this end, the PI plans to continue his investigation of global uniqueness questions related to scalar curvature and the isoperimetric problem. Recently, several such problems have been understood in three dimensions, using a combination of powerful tools from geometric analysis (many of which are limited to three dimensions). One portion of the research will consist of investigating higher dimensional analogues of these results, which will necessitate the development of a wide array of new techniques. The ideas developed in these aforementioned global uniqueness works have also led to other (a priori unrelated) topics that the PI will investigate. For example, determining the validity of the Minkowski inequality for non-convex surfaces (possibly with an additional bending term) is related to the uniqueness question for large stable constant mean curvature surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds. Similarly, an invariant related to the least area in the homology class of a torus for certain Riemannian three-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature is related to the rigidity of area-minimizing cylinders in three-manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature. In a different (but related) direction, this project will also include investigation of the relationship between the geometry and topology of minimal surfaces, including the study of surfaces with simple topology or small index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A novel coarse-grain model will be developed to describe the self-assembly of MP crystals in the presence and absence of an applied magnetic field.  This model will be sufficiently efficient as to serve as a front-end biomaterial fabrication design tool across diverse combinations of MPs and supporting matrices.

This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.<br/><br/>The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity."

Such weakness -- due to injury, or to a neurological disorder such as stroke -- and the associated difficulty in walking, has become a pressing public health problem. One of the main reasons gait rehabilitation has not been very successful so far is the lack of basic understanding of the dynamics of gait in both intact and impaired walkers. A major scientific challenge for the field is the creation of a comprehensive sensorimotor model, which can be used to understand inter-leg coordination, a fundamental mechanisms of walking. Experiments enabled by a novel robotic variable stiffness treadmill will be used to model walking gaits of individuals with hemiparesis, and to inform model-based robotic interventions for rehabilitation. The benefits of this approach will be also realized in other fields, including orthotics and prosthetics, as well as in robotic walkers. <br/><br/>The project will address important research questions related to inter-leg coordination mechanisms during gait that will provide the foundation for transformative gait retraining methods. More specifically, the unique investigation of the effect of sensory feedback on neuromuscular mechanisms of inter-leg coordination, made possible by the Variable Stiffness Treadmill, will be used as a window into the sensorimotor control mechanisms of gait. A system dynamics and control approach to robotic intervention for retraining gait will enhance our understanding of the role of the sensori-motor processes involved in gait. Understanding and modeling the dynamics that govern the sensori-motor mechanisms of inter-leg coordination in gait naturally results in the introduction of model-based interventions for gait therapy using inter-leg coupling, which has never been attempted before. Specifically, the project leverages existing central mechanisms of leg coordination and introduces the concept of evoking activity on the paretic leg through model-based interventions on the unimpaired leg. Inter-leg coordination, a fundamental process of walking, is going to be investigated and modeled as a multivariable dynamical system in intact walkers using the unique sensori-motor capabilities of the Variable Stiffness Treadmill. Then, the same experimental protocol will be applied to hemiparetic walkers. The goal is to understand the altered dynamics and specific gait mechanisms and pathways that are disrupted in hemiparesis. Finally, the developed models will result in targeted model-based interventions towards gait therapy of stroke survivors."

The ability to modify these interactions with designed molecules (peptides) has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry. Professor Del Valle's work focuses on the mimicry of beta-sheets. This is a protein structure that is notoriously difficult to study due its tendency to clump together (aggregate). This research provides a toolkit for generating stable and aggregation-resistant mimics of the protein beta sheets.

Central to this issue is the ability to reliably represent the ocean state globally and over its full depth. Many researchers have turned to describe and understand oceanic change and variability from ocean reanalyses (ORA), which are the combination of ocean models, atmospheric forcings, and ocean observations through various data assimilation methods and potentially provide more accurate information than observation-only or model-only based ocean estimations. Also, ORAs provide more variables and quantities to interpret and understand the oceanic change and variability. At present, estimates from ORAs, especially their temporal evolutions, are still sensitive to the change of the observing system, the errors of the dynamical model, atmospheric forcing, and the data assimilation methods. Many of the uncertainties are often flow dependent and are hard to identify and estimate. This research proposes a novel, yet simple way to discover the possible systematic errors and biases in the temperature estimates from ORAs and then utilizes the most physically consistent ORAs to perform analysis on the changes in global and regional OHC. The proposed study can potentially provide a unified view for the recently much-debated global surface warming hiatus, and will advance understanding of the decadal variability of ocean heat uptake as well as provide useful implications about the imbalance of radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The project will support an early career scientist and a graduate student contributing to building the next generation of scientists. In addition, it will contribute to the development of k-12 educational material explaining the role of the oceans in regulating climate change.<br/><br/>In this project, a simple but rarely used method will be used to evaluate a large set of the existing ORA products and determine if they are suitable for examining climatic-scale changes in global and regional ocean heat content (OHC). This evaluation is based on examining the changes of the thermal-steric and halo-steric contributions to the global steric height over time. To first order, the size of the global halo-steric component should be very small, as it is controlled by changes in freshwater input into the global ocean. After evaluating existing ORAs, the ones selected as having the smallest potential errors in long-term OHC will be analyzed with a goal to better understand the processes that determine the observed OHC change and variability. The team will assess whether the decadal-scale slight reduction in surface temperature was real and whether it reflected transport of extra heat to deeper layers of the ocean. Researchers will also carry out the analyses with a focus to separate the contributions of isopycnal movement (heave) and change in water mass properties along isopycnals (spiciness). If available in the selected ORAs, the vertical heat flux and the associated dynamical variables will also be examined."

Learning how to participate in this type of discussion, called scientific argumentation, is an important component of STEM education.  Scientific argumentation is included in the definition of scientific literacy established by the National Research Council, which defines ""engaging in argument from evidence"" as a practice to be incorporated in STEM classrooms.  The goal of this project is to integrate a study of developing skills in scientific argumentation and online learning to examine how to best engage students in scientific argumentation using online discussion boards.  Many undergraduate institutions provide classes online; however, it is unclear how to optimize these virtual classrooms to promote effective argumentation skills.  This project will examine the framing of questions for argumentation and will ask whether questions that more closely align with students' lives and interests promote more fruitful online argumentation.  The project will also examine factors related to student identity (e.g. gender, group dynamics and group inclusivity) in participation in online argumentation, as well as whether participation in online argumentation affects conceptual and/or cognitive development in students.  Findings from the project are expected to contribute to the ongoing analysis of the benefits (or drawbacks) of online STEM education.<br/><br/>Online discussion boards are used widely and are potentially valuable instructional tools, but little is known about the science learning that occurs via these discussion boards.  This project's goal is to bridge intellectual circles examining scientific argumentation and online learning to provide a greater understanding of how to engage students in scientific argumentation using the asynchronous discussion board.  This project will answer three research questions: (1) to what extent does introductory question-driven discussion affect students' abilities to frame productive scientific argumentation as behavior appropriate to a science classroom? (2) To what extent do group characteristics (e.g. gender) mediate the scientific argumentation behaviors that group members engage in during online and fact-to-face discussions?

The questions of what velocity fields effectively enhance or prevent transport and mixing, or steer quantities (such as mass concentration or density distribution) to a desired distribution, have attracted increasing attention. This project aims to use modern techniques from optimal control theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization to address these questions. The project will foster interdisciplinary collaboration and education efforts among different research groups and will also help train advanced undergraduate and graduate students across fields including mathematics, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods.  <br/> <br/>The objective of this research is to establish an innovative and rigorous mathematical framework for achieving optimal transport and mixing via active control of fluid flows. The project focuses on (1) optimizing transport and mixing via control of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with internal (distributed) and boundary control designs employed for different physical applications; (2) investigating the transport behavior of non-dissipative scalars, both passive and active, governed by the transport equations and addressing active transport through buoyancy-driven flows, modeled by the 2D Boussinesq approximation; and (3) applying non-smooth regularization to improve the sparsity of the controls. Investigation of the existence of an optimal control, differentiability of the coupled nonlinear system, and derivation of optimality conditions promises to launch new directions in nonlinear control, nonconvex optimization, and nonsmooth analysis of semi-dissipative systems. It will also contribute to the development of effective computational methods. The optimal control synthesis developed in this project will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in other complex flows, such as mass transfer in electrically conducting fluids, heat exchange in compressible flows, and double diffusion in oceanography, that are of great interest to a broad range of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is increasingly a public and policy concern. This research will focus on understanding how different agricultural strategies were used as el Nino disasters occurred in the past with changing frequency and strength.  Understanding how agriculturalists switched between productive strategies will improve long-term adaptations to climate change, provide theoretical and applied models for how to address climate change in future planning and development, and promote local adaptive capacities.  Using agriculture as a set of case studies, these models can be generalized to other forms of economic networks to understand how various strategies can promote resilience. This project will establish new multidisciplinary approaches to tackle such complex problems as climate change adaptation, and train graduate students from the partner institutions and countries in international collaborations. <br/> <br/>Dr. Vining and his team will examine how prehispanic agriculturalists developed and switched between various productive strategies as the el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) changed in frequency and severity.  The study region, north coastal Peru, hosted a series of civilizations between approximately 2000 BC - 1450 AD, including the Moche, Lambayeque, and Chimu societies.  However, the region is also particularly vulnerable to el Nino induced disasters, such as occurred recently in 2016-2017.  Initial archaeological work in this region indicates that prehispanic agriculture was based on a suite of strategies.  The complex economies that supported prehispanic societies were based on in part on switching amongst agricultural strategies as climatic contexts shifted.  The researchers come from the fields of archaeology, paleolimnology and palaeoclimate, and ecological modeling. A principal objective will be to combine high-precision dating of agricultural systems with paleoclimate conditions reconstructed from lake cores.  The researchers will use this multidisplinary methodological background to improve historic reconstructions of past ENSO variations, record archaeological examples of agricultural technologies in their environmental context, and reconstruct how different strategies were employed as ENSO effected climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are natural polymers, and are specific sequences of amino acids put together easily and efficiently by the living cell. The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials (C-GEM) takes a bio-inspired approach making a sequence of synthetic polymers by re-engineering the cell's systems.  In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length. NSF C-GEM establishes a new, transformative field of chemistry and fosters innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier. The applications of the new materials with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities, including improved communication to the public. These education and participation programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce. NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net, to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate in the research process and track results. <br/><br/>The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting, drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus. The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce, and improves communication with the public."

Electrotaxis, the phenomenon by which cells bias their motion directionally in response to an externally applied electrical field, is important in a number of cellular processes; however, the underlying physical mechanism of how electric fields influence cytoskeletal organization within the cell is unknown. The overall goal of the planned research is to determine the physical mechanisms responsible for initiating electrotaxis in cells.

Many eukaryotic cells have internal compasses that allow them to sense these cues, often in the form of gradients of chemoattractant, voltage, or mechanical stress, and bias their motion in a specific direction. Electrotaxis, the phenomenon by which cells bias their motion directionally in response to an externally applied electrical field, is important in a number of cellular processes; however, the underlying physical mechanism of how electric fields are transduced into the cell to influence cytoskeletal organization is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the relevant physical mechanisms responsible for initiating electrotaxis in cells. The goal will be achieved by observing electrotactic migration and quantifying the ion activity surrounding electrotaxing cells using precise microfluidic cell confinement chambers. The specific objectives are:  1) to develop and build microfluidic confinement geometries for cell membrane level analysis of electrokinetic ion flux during electrotaxis, 2) to quantify the electric field-induced membrane processes including ion-flow and ion channel activity during electrotaxis, and 3) to understand how downstream cell signaling is activated and transduced by these upstream electric field-induced events. The intellectual merit of the planned research is based on the innovative strategy and fundamental significance in determining the physical entry point where electric fields are transduced into a downstream chemical signal during cellular electrotaxis.
