While the Border Gateway Protocol plays a critical role in the Internet communications, it remains highly vulnerable to many attacks. This is because the protocol was originally designed for each BGP router to trust all protocol related messages, especially path announcements, sent by its neighboring routers. As a result, incorrect and malicious path information would be accepted by routers at face value, potentially leading to destination unreachable problems in the Internet. To address this issue, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) was introduced in 2012 to allow routers to verify path announcements in the Border Gateway Protocol. However, today there is a dearth of information available about the vulnerability of the RPKI, and how routers in the Internet have actually deployed and managed it. This project will develop techniques to better understand and improve the management of RPKI, helping to better secure the Internet. Given the early stage of the RPKI protocol, the findings in this project stand a good chance of being integrated to improve the state of the system. The project would train students in related research. The findings of the project would identify what the current security problems of RPKI are and help spur a greater adoption of RPKI by releasing the codes, datasets and analysis tools developed in the project and presenting the research outcomes to other researchers, administrators, and Internet operations related working groups.<br/><br/>This project has two research foci, each examining the management and improving security challenges of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure. First, the project will analyze existing RPKI repositories from multiple vantage points in an effort to understand how much of actual Border Gateway Protocol feeds in the Internet are verifiable. It will also determine what fraction of routers are actually using RPKI to validate paths. For this focus, the investigators will collaborate with one of the biggest network operators that have the most-peered global networks in existence. Second, the project will develop new techniques to detect misconfigurations of routers and potential security vulnerabilities. For this purpose, the project will host a custom RPKI repository that have multiple invalid routes, which will be used to test RPKI validators or routers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biologically available nitrogen (or ""fixed N"") is an essential nutrient for the microscopic plants (phytoplankton) in the ocean.  The supply of fixed N can limit the growth of phytoplankton and the capacity of the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Following the flow and transformation of fixed N is a powerful approach for understanding how the physics, biology, chemistry interact to determine the biological fertility of the ocean and its storage of carbon dioxide away from the atmosphere. With such an understanding, we may be able to predict how the ocean will change in response to human activities and thus affect the conditions for life in the future. Nitrate (NO3-) is the primary form of fixed N in the ocean, and both its nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) atoms occur in more than one mass, or ""isotope"": 14N and 15N for N and 16O and 18O for O. The ratios of these isotopes are affected by biological processes, and so isotopic measurements of nitrate reveal processes at work in the ocean that are otherwise hard to disentangle. Moreover, the isotope ratio of N in the ocean through time is recorded in the organic matter of the sediments that accumulate on the seafloor. Thus, the isotopes allow us to reconstruct important features of the past ocean, such as how the sequestration of carbon dioxide by ocean life has changed over past climate changes, which may indicate how this sequestration will change in the future. This project will produce the largest data set so far on the isotopic composition of nitrate in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean is one of the three major basins of the global ocean, the one that has been studied the least, and it may prove to be the best basin for reconstructing past surface ocean conditions because of the abundance of microfossils in its sediments. The measurements of nitrate isotopes generated in this project will serve many purposes. As one example, it will allow for a determination of the circulation path by which nitrate is transferred up from the deep waters to the sunlit surface waters where growing phytoplankton require this nutrient. As a second example, the measurements will help to calibrate new nitrogen isotopic methods for reconstructing past ocean conditions, which utilizes the organic matter trapped in the fossil shells of foraminifera, a type of zooplankton. In order to explain these goals and to spread our understanding of the ocean to educators, each of the two years of the project, a 1-day workshop will be held for the Teachers as Scholars program of the Princeton University Program in Teacher Preparation, which brings middle and high school teachers to Princeton to interact with faculty and learn about important scientific questions and research. The workshop will focus on accessing and visualizing ocean data sets and other oceanographic content for active learning in the classroom. Undergraduates will be involved in the research through summer internships, junior projects, and/or senior theses.<br/><br/>This project will produce analyses of the nitrate 15N/14N and 18O/16O ratios in samples collected during the upcoming 2019-2020 GO-SHIP I05 zonal section across the South Indian Ocean from South Africa to Australia at 30-33 deg S. Nitrate 15N/14N and 18O/16O provide critical constraints on the cycle and input/output budget of marine fixed N. The I05 nitrate isotope data will be broadly useful, potentially serving as a cornerstone in the global ocean's nitrate isotope data set. Given the lack of nitrate isotope measurements in the Indian Ocean, especially in the main basin away from the low-[O2] regions to the North, this project will fill a major geographic gap. Moreover, it will provide dense spatial and depth coverage with the highest level of precision currently available, allowing for novel hydrography-based calculations of N fluxes. The nitrate isotope samples will be taken from the same bottles from which the GO-SHIP hydrographic and biogeochemical measurements will be made, maximizing the power of the nitrate isotope data set. The data set will be of use to the growing number of numerical ocean model simulations including biogeochemistry, for identifying regional oceanographic processes, and for ground-truthing paleoceanographic tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paralleling other forms of software reuse, reusing models can both speed up and simplify the development of ML-based systems. However, a lack of standardization, regulation, and verification of third-party ML models raises security concerns.  In particular, ML models are subject to adversarial attacks in which third-party attackers or model providers themselves might embed hidden behaviors that are triggered by pre-specified inputs.  This project aims at understanding the security threats incurred by reusing third-party models as building blocks of ML systems and developing tools to help developers mitigate such threats throughout the lifecycle of ML systems.  Outcomes from the project will improve ML security in applications from self-driving cars to authentication in the short term while promoting more principled practices of building and operating ML systems in the long run.<br/><br/>One major type of threat incurred by reusing third-party models is model reuse attacks, in which maliciously crafted models (""adversarial models"") force host ML systems to malfunction on targeted inputs (""triggers"") in a highly predictable manner. This project develops rigorous yet practical methods to proactively detect and remediate such backdoor vulnerabilities. First, it will empirically and analytically investigate the necessary conditions and invariant patterns of model reuse attacks. Second, leveraging these insights, it will develop a chain of mitigation tools that detect potential backdoors, pinpoint triggers, and provide mechanisms to fortify adversarial models against these attacks. Third, it will establish a unified theory of adversarial models and adversarial inputs to deepen more general understanding of adversarial ML. Finally, it will implement all the proposed techniques and system designs in the form of a prototype testbed, which provides a unique research facility for investigating a range of attack and defense techniques. New theories and techniques developed in this project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate education and used to raise public awareness of the importance of ML security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These traditional network security appliances often need to be placed at fixed network entry points and have a constant capacity with respect to the maximum amount of traffic they can process. Such rigid nature makes them inefficient in protecting today's prevailing programmable and virtualizable environments. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are two emerging networking paradigms that offer the potential to address those limitations and are able to facilitate elastic security with the design of a new breed of network security functions called virtual Network Security Functions (vNSFs). The major goal of this project is to extend the understanding and science of virtual Network Security Functions.  It will develop new technology for virtual Network Security Functions where security microservices can be deployed elastically, safely and efficiently, on demand, tailored to the needs of the situation. It addresses major challenges inherent in the management, design, deployment, and execution of virtual Network Security Functions that currently prevent the full use of their benefits. This project will also integrate a comprehensive education plan with the proposed research to train the next generation workforce in computational sciences. The project will foster the diversity of students by active recruitment of women and other under-represented groups for participation in the research.<br/><br/>This project will first propose a new firewall architecture to address challenges in virtual firewall scaling. This project will then explore solutions to facilitate safe and efficient virtualization of both traditional and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems. Finally, this project will develop a general framework, OpenNSFV, for supporting safe and efficient virtualization of network security functions. The proposed solutions of this project will be flexible, scalable, trustworthy, and optimal, and will substantially enhance the security of programmable and virtualizable network infrastructure. To demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of the proposed solutions, the project will implement, deploy, and evaluate the proposed security mechanisms in real production environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to analyze how some fundamental physical objects interact with fractal structures.  For instance, suppose we know that a field associated to a body in space (for instance its gravitational field) is well-behaved (say, has bounded magnitude), then what can we infer about the geometry of the body?  Does the condition upon the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?  A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have a self-similar or fractal behavior.  More precisely, one is interested in the extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a ""small"" set of values.  The principal investigator (PI) will incorporate both graduate and undergraduate students into the research program, training them for future careers in STEM fields.  The PI will organize annual undergraduate research symposia that will bring together undergraduate students interested in mathematical research across southeastern states to present their undergraduate research, build a network with others interested in pursuing research in the mathematical sciences, and provide information about research opportunities at the graduate level.<br/><br/>This project concerns the analysis of operators when the geometry underlying the problem is rough or fractal in nature.  The first question considered is: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund operator associated to it is bounded?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  Despite intense study over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify.  The second question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a ""thick"" subset?  Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The REU Site ""Increasing Statistical Preparation in Research Education for Underrepresented Undergraduates"" (INSPIRE U2 Program) will recruit and train 24 underrepresented female students in statistical analyses of big data. It is expected that this initiative will: 1) increase student interest in advanced degree programs; 2) provide support and mentorship to students; and 3) serve as a pipeline for entry into advanced degree programs. Each student will have the opportunity to conduct an independent research project, and in doing so, students will develop the skills, confidence, and inspiration to pursue advanced statistics opportunities within the sciences. Key innovations include: 1) the merging of two evidence-based training approaches; 2) training in the flexible application of knowledge; 3) analysis of data in real world contexts; and 4) intensive one-on-one mentoring and support. The project will have significant impact on science, policy, and society by increasing representation of women and ethnic minorities in statistical and data analysis fields and enhancing the rigor with which scientific research is conducted.<br/><br/>Women of color and minorities are less likely to pursue careers in statistical fields because of lack of uniquely stimulating opportunities and appropriate support within the college environment. Thus, there is a critical need for diverse perspectives in statistical inquiry because there are educational and societal benefits to such diversity. The primary aim of the REU site is to address this need. Each year, for 3 years, approximately 8 underrepresented undergraduate female students who are rising sophomores will receive training in statistical programs and analytical techniques, including modern techniques not commonly included in the undergraduate curriculum. Students will engage in research in a lab with a faculty mentor and develop their own research question, conduct data analyses to answer their research question, and prepare a poster and oral presentation. Finally, students will participate in activities to promote collaborative behavior such as student mentorship, faculty mentorship, panel discussions, professional development activities, and field trips. The overarching goal is diversification among trained individuals with statistical knowledge and skills, leading to the enhancement of the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surprisingly, the function of sleep remains one of nature's greatest mysteries. During sickness, sleep is enhanced by the immune system. Thus, one function may involve the redistribution of resources allowing for cellular repair following damage that occurs during injury or infection. The genes that regulate sleep are becoming better understood; interestingly, these genes are conserved among distantly related animals from invertebrates, like nematodes, to humans. By identifying novel sleep genes and their interactions in cellular pathways in relatively simple animals, one may gain insights into sleep regulation and function in more complex animals, like humans. This project uses a combination of genetic and behavioral approaches in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, including genetic manipulations, live monitoring of neural activity and animal video analyses, to manipulate and characterize sleep at the cellular and organismal level.  Notably, the gene discovery approaches used in this study will be incorporated into college physiology teaching labs and Philadelphia public school science classes, to provide unique STEM experiences for students focusing on genetics, whole-genome sequencing and behavior.<br/><br/>C. elegans display sleep following exposure to environmental stressors that may damage their cells, a behavior called stress-induced sleep (SIS). The proposed function of SIS is defined as a period of behavioral quiescence dedicated for cellular repairs that occur following insult or injury. Out of the 302-celled C. elegans nervous system, SIS is largely induced by a single interneuron, the ALA. The ALA releases neuropeptides, which induce different aspects of behavioral quiescence.  Recently, neuropeptides encoded by the gene nlp-14 were identified to be central regulators of SIS and are likely thought to be released from the ALA. NLP-14 peptides are both necessary and sufficient for SIS. These sleep-promoting peptides may function by facilitating the reduction of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in a subset of cells that contain high levels of cAMP during times of wakefulness. This project will elucidate the connections of the ALA and NLP-14 peptides to downstream circuitry. This will be examined via the measurement of cAMP levels in sleeping animals using an in vivo biosensor. Additionally, novel downstream cells will be identified through the activation of a red-light activated adenylyl cyclase, IlaC22, in groups of cells. It will investigate the mechanism(s) of activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), a metabolic master regulator that diverts cellular resources from growth to repair, which functions downstream of SIS. Also, this project will determine specific roles for the NLP-14 peptides in a three-part process: (i) the removal of individual peptides using CRISPR-Cas9, (ii) over expression of individual peptides in new transgenic strains, and (iii) a forward genetic suppressor screen to identify NLP-14 receptor(s). The genetic screen will be incorporated into high school outreach laboratory exercises to enhance STEM education in the Philadelphia community. This will be accomplished through field trips and the establishment of a webcast behavioral platform called WormCam.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) are the DNA molecules within ARB that code for antibiotic resistance. Monitoring of ARG in the Nation's waterways has increased as they are now considered a ""contaminant of emerging concern"". Despite their prevalence, there is limited information on ARG persistence and decay in surface waters. The objective of the proposed work is to fill this critical gap in our understanding of ARG risk. This will be achieved by evaluating the rates and mechanisms of ARG decay in surface water focusing on sunlight-mediated reactions. Results will provide the necessary information to predict public health risk due to ARG. Further benefits include the ability to identify key environmental control points for surveillance and deployment of treatment technologies. Integrated with this research will be an educational program that includes new courses and activities for high school and college students. The goal of which is to train the next generation of environmental engineers. Outreach will increase scientific literacy and public awareness of ARG and the connections between the environment and public health.<br/><br/>Sunlight-driven photolysis is an important process for the degradation of many microorganisms and organic molecules. Therefore, the underlying hypothesis for this research project is that ARG will undergo degradation in the environment due to photolysis, and that decay rates and the dominant photolysis mechanism will vary among ARG depending on their DNA sequence and the environmental conditions such as water chemistry and incident irradiance. To evaluate this hypothesis, the research objectives are to: 1) systematically evaluate direct photolysis, indirect photolysis, and sunlight-independent decay of key ARG under simulated sunlight and a range of environmental and water quality conditions; 2) conduct bacterial transformation experiments with sunlight-exposed ARG to determine whether a reduction in the quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal for an ARG corresponds to a reduction in its gene function; 3) use experimental data to develop broadly applicable numerical models that can predict photolysis rates of ARG under different environmental conditions; and 4) investigate the effect of DNA sequence on direct photolysis rates through the use of a novel sequencing-based assay to map the locations of sunlight-induced damage (e.g., formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) on each DNA target. The integrated education component of this project will include research and course-based activities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students that incorporate antibiotic resistance concepts, and introduce students to the field of environmental engineering. The PI will also develop and disseminate an engaging class module for high school students on the urban water cycle that will incorporate findings from the proposed research, and highlight engineering in service to society and the connections between the environment and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though many prior studies have developed routes to sustainable materials from a variety of resources such as plant sugars, plant oils, plant terpenes, carbon dioxide, polysaccharides, rosins, and microbial polyesters, challenges still persist in their broad implementation in society. One significant challenge is that new polymers must meet the performance and property expectations of existing materials in order to be adopted. However, new polymers developed from sustainable sources are rarely simple drop-in replacements for conventional polymers. The persistent challenge that this project addresses is that many sustainable polymers have features which significantly and adversely impact their properties and limit their use. The knowledge developed in this project will provide a route to overcoming these limitations, enabling the potential of widespread adoption in applications.  This project will also use outreach programs to cultivate knowledge among students and the general public on the important role of polymers in society and their environmental impacts. The Materials Day at UH program, providing opportunities for hands-on laboratory experiences, will be expanded with new modules in sustainable polymers. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable experiences through involvement in the research projects. Finally, demonstrations on sustainable polymers will be developed for the Houston Energy Day festival. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Developing advanced polymeric materials from sustainable sources with superior physical properties and greater function is a fundamentally important challenge in reducing the environmental impact of polymers. Vegetable oils and their fatty acids are convenient sources for polymers due to their wide availability, ease of functionalization, and lack of toxicity. The long alkyl chains of the fatty acids comprising vegetable oils have a large impact on the resulting polymer properties, which are tunable through choice of vegetable oil feedstock. Unfortunately, polymers with bulky constituents, such as the long alkyl side-chains of fatty acid-derived polymers, typically exhibit poor mechanical performance due to lack of entanglements. In this project, supramolecular interactions will be incorporated into the vegetable oil-derived polymers as a route to improve their mechanical behavior. The central hypothesis of this work is that the incorporation of supramolecular interactions in sustainable triblock copolymers will lead to a new class of sustainable materials with enhanced physical properties. Long-chain poly(meth)acrylates will be modified with functional groups to promote hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. These materials will be incorporated as the midblock of ABA triblock copolymers. The effective crosslink density and viscoelastic properties of the materials will be quantified.

However, existing methods to convert biomass, such as fast pyrolysis (rapid thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen), typically lead to both desired and undesired chemical products. The use of catalysts to accelerate desired chemical reaction pathways has been widely studied to address this challenge. However, the use of inhibitors to suppress undesired pathways has been rarely explored. Molten polymers are thermoplastics that melt at high temperature yet thermally degrade more slowly than biomass, making them good candidates as inhibitors in biomass conversion reactions. The goal of the proposed research project is to investigate the reaction pathways of biomass conversion in the presence of molten polymers.  Pathway inhibition with molten polymers will transform existing biomass conversion technologies by selectively promoting product yields in a tunable fashion.  <br/><br/>The project will examine the ability of MPs to attenuate undesired reaction pathways via transport and intrinsic reaction mechanisms. The research involves both experimental and computational elements on the use of MPs for selectively promoting the yields of desired products in biomass fast pyrolysis via physical inhibition of product escape and chemical inhibition of reactions involving hydroxyl groups. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results that show a significant increase in levoglucosan and furfural yields during cellulose pyrolysis in the presence of MPs. Pyrolysis experiments will be conducted on glucose-based carbohydrates microscopically mixed with MPs with controlled structures in a microreactor. The energy barriers of key pyrolysis reactions affected by the MPs will be estimated from ab initio calculations. The objective will be to reveal the fundamental mechanisms by which MPs promote product yields in biomass pyrolysis. Integration of research and education will be accomplished by engaging students through interactive teaching, experiential learning, and community outreach. This will be enabled by a game-based software tool, Biomass Conversion Visualizer (BioCon), to be created as part of this project.  BioCon will serve as the primary platform for the proposed education and outreach activities and will be designed with assistive technology to broaden the participation of students with learning disabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant will benefit U. S. consumers and service providers and contribute to an increased competitiveness of the e-commerce sector by addressing critical challenges faced in revenue management and operations of modern marketplaces. With the ubiquity of online customer review platforms, price aggregators, discussion forums, and connected communities, the modern consumer displays increasing tendencies to form socially influenced opinions, imitate other users, learn and anticipate prices, and time their purchases. Market mechanisms that fail to account for such consumer behavior can result in significant losses in terms of revenue, inventory, and consumer welfare. This project will leverage the opportunity presented by the abundance of consumer activity data to learn and account for consumer behavior when designing market pricing and allocation mechanisms. The research conducted will benefit both consumers and sellers through a more efficient matching of demand and supply. The educational and outreach initiatives of this program will enable inclusive participation and engagement of students at all levels, and promote interdisciplinary, hands-on education in data science and decision making. <br/><br/>The research plan of this project addresses some critical gaps in the current online machine learning techniques, which are typically designed assuming independent and identically distributed or exogenously generated data; and therefore, are ill suited to handle the endogeneity that may result from frequent social interactions and strategic consumer. The research plan investigates new learning techniques for dynamic pricing, recommendation, and allocation under three broad classes of commonly occurring consumer behavior: (1) social influence and imitation, (2) forward-looking and planning behavior, and (3) consumer learning behavior. For each of these categories, it will develop new models and decision-making frameworks that can capture natural and uncertain consumer behavior while being conducive to learning.  New methods for exploration-exploitation, dynamic learning, and online optimization will be developed, which will build upon and advance tools from multi-armed bandits, online convex optimization, dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning.

While the demand on the use of LiB is increasing everyday there are some safety issues that remain unresolved. These battery packs are susceptible to catching fire which pose a great danger to human life and property. The fire hazard in these batteries is caused by a continuous rise of temperature phenomenon (called ""thermal runaway"") that is not well understood. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project aims at developing reliable high-fidelity mathematical models that can help understand this phenomenon and help predict the thermal behavior more accurately. The success of this project will have huge impact on electrification happening in various industry sectors including transportation, grid, energy, and several others. This project will integrate research into diverse education and outreach activities, including curriculum improvement, community outreach, and research mentorship, to engage K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/> <br/>Despite its importance, LiB thermal management practices are largely empirical or coarse-grained with poor scientific rigor, thus inadequate for meeting the safety demands. To change this situation, this research will develop a foundational framework for characterizing and monitoring LiB packs' spatially and temporally distributed thermal behavior, which will build on a multi-disciplinary synthesis of ideas from first-principles modeling, machine learning, distributed estimation, and network systems. This will drive new knowledge advancement in: 1) a hybrid modeling methodology that integrates first-principles-based and data-driven machine learning models, 2) optimal estimation and machine learning theory based on hybrid models, and 3) hybrid-model-based principles, algorithms and tools for temperature field reconstruction and thermal runaway detection. The models and algorithms will be rigorously evaluated through a mix of theoretical analysis, software-based simulation, and experimental validation using a fully instrumented PEC SBT4050 battery tester. The results will open a new research avenue for LiB packs' thermal management while advancing the modeling, estimation and learning theories for complex spatio-temporal systems, with potential application to many other engineering fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Little is known about how this relationship helps prevent disease. Thus host-microbe biology is an exciting frontier for discovery. Amphibians are an excellent model system to study the symbiotic relationships between animal hosts and microbes because their moist skin surfaces have properties similar to the human digestive tract and lungs. The current award will use this model to test whether peptides secreted onto the skin of the northern leopard frog regulate skin microbiota by supporting the growth of beneficial bacteria and by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. The results of this study will inform microbial therapies and contribute to conservation efforts as well. Since one third of the world's amphibian species are currently threatened, this research will also inform amphibian disease management and conservation at a critical time when continued disease emergence is harming biodiversity. Central to the NSF CAREER award, this project integrates research with education by implementing a Mentored Research Lab course on Microbiome and Disease Ecology to provide authentic research experiences. In learning communities, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will give mentorship to undergraduates. An advisory board of microbial and disease ecologists, professional education specialists, and faculty will provide collaboration and training.

The central hypothesis is that amphibian skin peptides regulate the skin microbiome, thus impacting host-pathogen interactions. Specific objectives are: (1) Identify interactions between skin defense peptides and microbiota under field and controlled mesocosm conditions including comparisons among host life-history stages with different peptide expression patterns, (2) test if host skin peptides support microbes isolated from hosts (promicrobial function) and inhibit potentially invasive environmental microbes (antimicrobial function), (3) examine the role of defense peptides in regulating microbiome stability by experimentally reducing skin peptides and testing for microbial dysbiosis under different environmental conditions, and (4) test the role of microbial community phylogenetic diversity prompting complexity of host defense peptide expression on the skin through controlled experiments. Determining the trajectory of the microbiota through time under different environmental conditions will provide insight on whether microbiome assembly is stochastic, resilient, or adaptively shifts as defense peptides regenerate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, increases in the number and granularity of data sources raise problems of scale that complicate the already difficult problem of developing tools that help analysts manage the often-changing goals and analysis trajectories suggested by their exploratory work.  This project focuses on improving two key systems in exploratory data analysis tools: the visualization systems that provide graphical representations of the data, and the data management systems that efficiently manage large-scale data on the back end to support the analysis.  The key idea is to integrate these two systems by first inferring analysts' goals and future behaviors from their recent actions in the visualization system, then using those to proactively construct efficient processing queries in the data management system.  Doing this should improve system response times, which should in turn improve analysts' ability to use the system and the insights they gain; the techniques developed will contribute to the database, visualization, and human-computer interaction communities.  The tools themselves stand to benefit a number of scientific and industrial domains, and the team will also use the project work to support new interdisciplinary data science courses along with outreach and research opportunities for underrepresented students in computer science.<br/><br/>To improve performance, this project will produce dynamic optimization strategies for visual exploration systems, which infer the user's exploratory analysis goals over time, and deploy optimization algorithms tailored to the current analysis goal.  These optimizations will address both human performance, i.e., how effectively a scientist or analyst extracts insights and performs analysis tasks with a visual exploration system, and system performance, i.e., how efficiently and effectively the system responds to a user's interactions. The development of these optimizations will be done in two phases. First, a user study will be conducted to characterize how users interact with visual exploration systems under different exploratory data analysis scenarios and system designs. Second, using the collected study data, a predictive query execution engine will be designed to infer users' analysis goals from log data and detect shifts in behaviors over time. To boost data management system performance, existing techniques will be adapted to leverage the predictive query execution engine, including query scheduling of likely upcoming queries and multi-query optimization to leverage computational overlap between recent and predicted queries. To boost visualization system and human performance, the system will recommend predicted next queries to analysts, while the project team will conduct performance-driven interface design work to design new interactions based on data collected by the predictive query execution engine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will be impactful in the field of surgical robotics where interaction with the patient demands safety and effectiveness from both the human operator (surgeon) and the robotic system itself. Robotic systems that are aware and responsive to user skill and performance style could be more able to avoid user errors and respond to adverse events in unpredictable environments.

Research objectives include: developing methods to model and control human behavior (e.g., user behavior and expertise) during unstructured teleoperation tasks; designing and analyzing adaptive control laws to enhance performance through visual and haptic guidance; and evaluating the effectiveness of these algorithms on clinically-relevant outcomes in training and intervention using a surgical robotic platform. A key innovation of this work is designing control methods to be agnostic of the specific task performed by the human operator: only user-centric metrics and movement data will serve as inputs to novel difficulty and stylistic prediction models that will then be used to create adaptive control algorithms.

Human-machine interfaces have not only become popular technologies but have become the hope of many individuals for restoring their lost limb function. Decades of research went into making the interface between the human and the machine seamless, but scientists were unable to effectively address the inherent challenges, namely, complexity, adaptability and variability. To overcome the above challenges, it is critical to computationally understand and quantitatively characterize how humans control their senses and motor abilities. Biomimetically inspired models can help to understand this process, and can enable efficient control of the machine. The human hand has many dimensions and is an ideal testbed to understand sensorimotor control while interacting with computers and other machines. Hence the goal of this project is to design and develop biomimetic models that control the human hand and extend these models to the control of multidimensional machines. The societal impacts of the proposed project will be the development of new designs of artificial limbs for individuals with disabilities that are as close to natural in their functions. The educational and outreach impacts of the project will create opportunities for students and working engineers to learn the importance of human machine interfaces. The project will facilitate mentored international research and educational opportunities for students. The hands-on modules developed as an outflow of the proposed research will ignite interest in science and technology among students at all levels, particularly women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The means by which the central nervous system effortlessly controls the high dimensional human hand is still an unsolved mystery. To address this high dimensional control problem, many bioinspired motor control models have been proposed, one of which is based on synergies. According to this model, instead of controlling individual motor units, central nervous system simplifies the control using coordinated control of groups of motor units called synergies. However, there are several unanswered questions today. Where are synergies present? What is their role in motor control and motor learning? To answer these fundamental questions, this project takes a holistic and comprehensive approach. It combines the concepts of human motor control, computational neuroscience, machine learning and validation with noninvasive human experiments. The research objectives of this project are: to model the generation of synergies in human hand movements and validate the model with noninvasive human experiments using computational models, electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation, to model the behavior and the role of synergies in motor learning and to apply these synergies in multidimensional machine control and machine-assisted learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is the Godel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct"", then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory).

Because they have control over other programs and mediate use of hardware resources, defects in operating system code can compromise the reliability or security of any software running on the OS.  Most computers run one of just a few general-purpose operating systems, so a bug in any one of those systems will likely affect very many computers, making their correctness critical to countless computer-based systems used daily around the world. This project explores new ways to mathematically prove correctness properties of operating systems, and thereby to establish conclusively the impossibility of bugs in them. The project's novelties are a focus on verifying realistic OS designs similar to those used in industry, treating significant subtleties of OS control over hardware, and new approaches to specifying correctness for common design patterns in low-level code. The project's impacts are the introduction of new verification techniques for low-level code that are expected to apply more broadly than to operating systems, and integration with education. The project develops new ways of teaching undergraduate automata and computability courses, integrating modern applications from security and software verification to better demonstrate the material's value and improve student engagement.<br/> <br/>The project brings a range of techniques from modal logic to bear on OS verification, and attempts to show that these techniques support three kinds of reasoning that occur in operating system kernels and systems code in general: location virtualization (as in virtual-memory management and copy-on-write filesystems), caching (including hardware store buffers, translation lookaside buffers, and OS-level caches), and abstraction of a single protocol to be used in multiple different ways but in a compatible manner (as relevant to device driver frameworks).

For example, a student will likely perform much better on exams when alert than when drowsy or overly anxious. Arousal is regulated by several neuromodulatory systems, including the locus coeruleus (LC), which is a cluster of neurons in the brainstem whose damage often leads to neurodegenerative diseases.  Thus, from an engineering standpoint, it is plausible that control of LC activity could maximize behavioral performance in healthy individuals and treat LC related disorders.  However, the small size and deep location of the LC in the brainstem makes it challenging to access and manipulate.  To overcome this challenge, this project will use peripheral vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to control LC activity.  The vagus nerve, which runs from the brainstem to the colon area, is easy to access non-invasively, and the LC is the main brain structure that mediates the effect of VNS on brain activity.  Using cutting-edge machine learning and nonlinear control theory, this project aims to develop an engineering framework for controlling LC activity via periphery VNS and measuring pupil size, which is also an indicator of arousal level. The success of this project will lead to the development of non-invasive methods to enhance human perception and cognition and treat LC-related brain disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Research activities in the planned studies will enrich the undergraduate curriculum and provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students, who will contribute to the national highly-qualified workforce in the rapidly-growing biotechnology and biomedical engineering field. Moreover, the project is expected to broaden the participation in STEM of under-represented minority and female students with social-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The proposed educational curriculum and outreach activities will also engage the general public to increase their awareness of how STEM disciplines can be applied to solve problems in the nervous system.<br/><br/>The PI's long-term career research goal is to enhance human perception and cognition through control of population activities within the nervous system.  Toward this goal, this project is to develop an engineering framework that uses peripheral nerve stimulation to control neural population activity to achieve optimal behavioral performance while minimizing unintended side effects and to functionally validate this technology in an animal model.  The vagus nerve-to-locus coeruleus (LC) pathway will be  used as a model system to develop and test the technology.  This pathway was chosen because an FDA approved non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator exists and the LC plays a pivotal role in modulating brain functions through regulation of arousal levels.  Studies will include assessment of LC spiking activity and pupil size, which is a noninvasive proxy of LC activity that will be useful in future translation of the technology developed.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives. The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to identify the optimal parameter space of VNS (vagus nerve stimulation) for selectively modulating LC activity/pupil size while minimizing side effects on heart rate using Bayesian active learning.  A cohort of animals will be implanted with electrodes for left VNS at the level of the carotid artery (blunt dissection) and with a wireless electrocardiography (ECG) transmitter to monitor heart rate.  A genetically-encoded calcium indicator will be selectively expressed in LC neurons using viral vectors, enabling calcium imaging of the activity of LC populations of neurons.  The average spiking activity of the LC neurons will then be inferred from the fluorescence signals.  Bayesian active learning will be used to discover the VNS parameter spaces in which VNS has high efficacy in driving LC activity/pupil size while leaving minimal effects on heart rate.  Stimulation will be presented in the form of bursts of charge-balanced bi-phasic current pulses with short inter-pulse intervals.  The parameter space will include current amplitude of the higher amplitude phase of the pulses, pulse width of the higher amplitude phase, pulse polarity (i.e. cathode-leading or anode-leading), pulse waveform, asymmetry ratio, inter-pulse interval, number of pulses per burst, and inter-burst interval. The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to synthesize a nonlinear closed-loop controller for control of LC population activity/pupil size while minimizing changes in heart rate through VNS.  Non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) models will be used to model the nonlinear synamics of the vagus nerve-to-LC and vagus nerve-to-pupil circuitry.  A nonlinear predictive model controller based on the GP models will be synthesized to control LC population activity/pupil size through VNS in a closed-loop fashion.   Different nonlinear optimization methods will be tested in the controller, and extensive simulations will be conducted to evaluate its performance. The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to functionally validate the technology in awake behaving animals.  The extent to which the controller is able to maintain optimal behavioral performance while producing minimal side effects for animals in real-world applications will be examined.  Rats instrumented for monitoring the spiking performance of neurons in the LC will be trained to perform a tactile detection task, e.g., licking a water spout in response to a whisker deflection.   Their behavioral performance will be quantitatively evaluated from the probabilities of their correct and incorrect responses to sensory stimuli.  The behavioral performance and heart rate of animals in sessions with the stimulator on will be compared to those in sessions with the stimulator off.  Different firing rates will be tested to determine which firing rate results in optimal behavior performance. The successful completion of the above objectives will provide, for the first time, an engineering framework to guide the design and validation of optimal, closed-loop stimulation for enhancing behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include the production of biofuels, post-combustion carbon capture, and particle-based solar receivers.  In addition, many natural processes involve multiphase heat and mass transfer in a turbulent flow.  For example, ocean spray ejected from breaking waves affects air-sea fluxes that influence the intensity of hurricanes.  However, there are many challenges associated with modeling how turbulent mixing interacts with the reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and heat transfer across length and time scales.  Because of these challenges, most existing models are based on empirical correlations that do a poor job at predicting measurements in applications of interest.  This project aims to improve our fundamental understanding of these complex multiphase flows and enable predictive models that work across varying regimes.  The Principal Investigator will use his expertise in multiphase flows and turbulence modeling to accomplish three goals.  He will 1) establish a connection between two-phase flow dynamics and rates of heat and mass transfer, 2) use recent advances in data science and machine learning to link physical processes across scales, and 3) create a museum exhibit that highlights the art and science of these complex flows and its role in the energy sector.<br/><br/>While there has been significant progress characterizing hydrodynamic interactions in particle-laden flows, much less is known about interphase heat and mass transfer. State-of-the-art codes used in industry and academia rely on simplistic models for average reaction rates as well as heat and mass transfer coefficients that are known to vary by orders of magnitude across two-phase flow regimes, resulting in enormous predictive uncertainty. The main limitation is the lack of meaningful data that describe multiphase interactions from the level of individual particles to larger scales of interest. In this project, unique, high fidelity numerical simulations will isolate two-way coupling between the phases and establish a relationship between multiphase interactions and heat/mass transfer. The emergence of inverse modeling and machine learning has enabled new approaches to systemically inform models with such data, and will be used here to quantify and reduce model uncertainty. The combination of these efforts will result in a new paradigm in data-driven multiphase turbulence modeling.  Results are anticipated to have far-reaching impact on energy and environmental applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional alloys are typically made of one principal alloying element with addition of other low-concentration alloying elements for improving alloy properties. Recently, concentrated alloys have received significant interests due to their novel properties. Different from conventional alloys, concentrated alloys consist of two or more principal alloying elements. These concentrated alloys exhibit outstanding physical properties compared to conventional alloys including high-temperature strength, corrosion resistance, radiation tolerance, as well as wear and fatigue resistance. Such superior properties are related to the unique formation and transport mechanisms of crystal defects in concentrated alloys, which are poorly understood to date. The goal of this project is to use novel computational approaches to narrow this knowledge gap. The proposed research will study the effects of alloy composition, atomic configuration of alloying elements, interaction between alloying elements on the defect formation and transport mechanisms in concentrated alloys. The connection between the atomistic mechanisms and long-term defect evolution will be assessed to understand the importance of these mechanisms on the microstructural evolution in alloys. Successful completion of this project will reveal the atomic origins that lead to the unique defect properties in concentrated alloys. The understanding may help establish science-based principles for down-selecting alloying elements to control defect diffusion and mass transport in concentrated alloys and thus achieve desired physical properties. Through laboratory sessions and hands-on computer simulation training at two outreaching programs at Virginia Tech that target on recruiting high school students from under-represented groups into engineering disciplines, this project will help attract and recruit next-generation materials scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds. In addition, the research will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses to educate and retain students in computational materials science and physical metallurgy. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Lattice defects such as interstitials and vacancies as well as their clusters are main mass transport carriers in materials. Their diffusion is a critical process for governing the microstructural evolution and thus the change of physical properties in materials. Although defect energetics and dynamics are well studied in pure metals and dilute alloys, they are poorly understood in concentrated alloys including high-entropy alloys. The main objective of this project is to understand the atomic origins for the unique defect energetics and dynamics in concentrated alloys such as sluggish diffusion, which are further determined by the complex atomic configurations and interactions of alloying elements. The proposed research will start from binary concentrated alloys and gradually extend to ternary alloys and high-entropy alloys. Multiscale modeling methods including molecular statics, molecular dynamics, temperature accelerated dynamics, and cluster dynamics will be used. To understand the effect of atomic configuration, alloys of different compositions including the percolation threshold, will be studied to elucidate whether percolation leads to preferential diffusion of alloying elements. For the effect of interatomic interaction, different interactions between alloying elements will be selected in a desired way to determine the relative importance between defect formation energies and migration barriers on the sluggish diffusion. Temperature accelerated dynamics will be used to study the non-intuitive defect cluster migration mechanisms, which can reach long timescales but with full atomic fidelity. Cluster dynamics will be used to evaluate the importance of different types of defects and clusters on the long-term defect evolution at the experimentally accessible timescales. Accomplishing these tasks will enable understanding of the unique defect formation and transport mechanisms in concentrated alloys and may help the research community design novel alloys of optimum properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This growing capacity to collect visual data has not, however, been matched by a comparable acceleration in the ability of individuals being recorded (by themselves or others) to measure, analyze, and predict from this data as they desire. This project develops a computer vision system that performs tasks of learning from personal visual data, e.g., dietary monitoring via a user's wearable cameras. The project will develop a common 3D geometry representation to encode multiview image streams that can provide an auxiliary spatial constraint to enable semi-supervised learning. This representation will enable many computer vision tasks by leveraging a large or potentially infinite number of unlabeled multiview image streams. The investigator plans to disseminate this research through multiple educational activities, including: (a) K-12 students of under-represented groups through a series of workshops in Summer Technology Camp, Girls' Machine Learning Day Camp, and the Robot Show at the University Minnesota; (b) public demonstration of the research outcomes annually at the Minnesota State Fair;  (c) undergraduate research involvement through short course material developments; (d) new curriculum development on the raster multiview algebra that consolidates multiview geometry and visual recognition (deep learning); and (e) dissemination of research findings through tutorial and workshop organization for broader audiences in computer vision.<br/><br/>This research investigates a new raster representation of multiview geometry that offers a tight integration of 3D reconstruction with the training of a visual recognition model. This theory will allow extensive utilization of the unlabeled multiview image streams in two ways: (1) by actively exploring multiview visual data through 3D reconstruction in an unsupervised manner, and (2) by geometrically transferring a probabilistic belief across views for cross-view supervision. The project will generalize this theory to uncalibrated moving cameras through a novel raster bundle adjustment. This research program will lay a computational foundation for two major scientific disciplines: (1) Behavioral science: the raster theory will address many customized visual tasks to characterize microscopic social signals, enabling us to overcome the fundamental limitations of existing approaches in behavioral assessments for at-risk children (such as those with autism spectrum disorder, which have typically been assessed using a subjective and sporadic measure); and (2) Neuroscience: the planned research will enable computational measurement of free-ranging activities of primate subjects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent years have witnessed an explosion in research on topological materials spurred by their unusual quantum behavior and by the novel technologies they promise to enable. Such materials can host currents that require relatively little power to drive due to their topological properties, and in some cases these currents can be activated by applying light or magnetic fields. These features of topological materials make them candidates for important applications currently pursued including a new wave of low-dissipation electronics, photodetectors, and solar cell devices. Making these technologies a reality requires a deep understanding of their rich physics. The goal of this project is to develop new theoretical techniques that can be used to make accurate predictions about the behavior of currents in these materials in the presence of applied electric fields, magnetic fields, or lasers. These predictions could then be used to guide further progress toward new experiments, technological applications, and advances in fundamental understanding of topological materials and materials more generally. To realize these and many more technological advances going forward, it is crucial to strengthen the workforce in condensed matter physics and more broadly in STEM fields. Current projections indicate that insufficient numbers of students are obtaining degrees in these fields to maintain present technological output levels. This project focuses on recruiting more students to STEM in three ways: (i) By giving students a better understanding of the field and related career paths through high school lecture series; (ii) By providing research opportunities to high school and undergraduate students; (iii) By mentoring graduate and undergraduate students to prepare them for STEM careers. These efforts will be carried out with a particular emphasis on strengthening diversity.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education on topological materials. The research component addresses fundamental questions pertaining to the transport of spin, valley, or charge in driven topological materials. Despite enormous interest and rapid progress, much of the basic physics of these processes remains unclear due to the non-equilibrium, many-body nature of the problem. The PI aims to shed light on these processes by developing theories based on advanced techniques that enable one to retain time-dependent information about both system and bath without sacrificing calculability. The main goals of the project include: (i) Explain non-equilibrium and many-body phenomena in topological quantum materials. Primary focus is given to optical driving and polarized spin injection in topological insulators and transition metal dichalcogenides, and to chiral anomalous transport in Weyl semimetals. (ii) Develop a theory of dynamic feedback mechanisms that arise under external driving. This theory will employ generalized master equations, dynamical maps, and other techniques to track the evolution of both carriers and their quantum environment. Methods for controlling the bath will be devised to mitigate adverse effects and develop new technological capabilities. The developed techniques will be applicable to a broad range of many-body systems. (iii) Understand the interplay of strong Coulomb interactions and topology in the transport of spin and valley polarization in 2D materials and in anomalous charge transport in 3D semimetals by combining many-body and non-equilibrium theory techniques. (iv) Develop an outreach program that recruits more students into STEM fields, including quantum condensed matter physics. This will consist of high school lecture series and research internships for undergraduate and advanced high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smart computer programs can now categorize images better than humans, beat the world champion at Go, and make intelligent recommendations in areas from health care to education. Under the hood, many of these technologies are made possible by the idea of using highly flexible and structured probabilistic models to express and reason with complex phenomena. Meanwhile, probabilistic models required for modern machine learning systems are becoming increasingly complex, and the ability to compute probabilities efficiently becomes one of the main bottlenecks of modern learning systems. The goal of this project is to develop a new theoretical and algorithmic framework of efficient and approximate computation of probabilities for highly complex probabilistic models. This project provides research opportunities for undergraduates and it also develops educational modules for outreach activities to high school students and undergraduates.<br/><br/>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) have been the two major types of approximate inference algorithms that dominate the literature. However, both of them have their own critical weaknesses. MCMC is accurate but suffers from slow convergence; VI is typically faster but introduces deterministic errors and lacks theoretical guarantees.  This project aims to introduce a new Stein variational paradigm for approximate inference that integrates the advantages of MCMC and VI, enabling algorithms that are as flexible and accurate as MCMC and as fast as VI. The key idea is to directly optimize a non-parametric particle-based representation to fit intractable distributions with fast deterministic gradient-based updates, which is made possible by integrating and generalizing key mathematical tools from Stein's method, optimal transport and interacting particle systems. A basic algorithm derived from this framework, called Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD),  has already been found to be a powerful tool in a range of applications. This project extends this initial success to a higher level, by (1) systematically investigating basic theoretical problems, (2) developing more efficient and practical algorithms and software,  and (3) demonstrating its power in various interdisciplinary applications, including reinforcement learning and molecule dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This behavior can be used to develop compact and efficient actuators, sensors, and a variety of microelectronic devices.  Structural transformations start near a defect or imperfection in a material, which facilitates the rearrangement of atoms.  However, when considering transformations in small volumes of material, the probability of encountering such a rare defect is low, resulting in unpredictable and inefficient operation.  In extreme cases, this can stop the transformation from occurring entirely.  This project's aims are to understand the role that defects play in initiating structural transformations, and to find an approach to introduce such defects into a material.  This would allow the operation of devices at micrometer and nanometer length-scales.  The broader objectives of this proposal include developing distributable interactive materials science experiments ('lab in a box') that can be performed remotely to engage distance students.  Additionally, this proposal will engage undergraduate (UG) students, and in particular transfer students from community colleges, through targeted UG research opportunities and through societally impactful engineering design challenges related to the proposed research.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Diffusionless solid-state phase transformations generally nucleate from sparse, high energy atomic-scale defects in the crystal lattice.  One of the grand challenges in materials science is understanding how material heterogeneity and disorder can be harnessed to influence the properties of materials.  In particular, while dislocation defect models of heterogeneous nucleation in martensitic transformations (MTs) are fairly well-developed, the role of clusters of point defects is very poorly understood, despite initial observations that irradiation induced defect clusters can serve as potent nucleation sites. The outcomes of this study will advance the science of nucleation of MTs 1) by measuring the number density of native nucleation sites as a function of thermodynamic driving force, and determining the role of lattice compatibility in governing size-dependent nucleation behavior, and 2) by experimentally quantifying the potency of irradiation-induced defect clusters and He nanobubbles. These observations will be used to develop and test a defect-cluster based MT nucleation model.  The educational outcomes of this proposal will impact two paradigm shifts currently underway in UG engineering education: 1) broader adoption of active learning methods, and 2) effective and scalable approaches to distance education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is thus essential to improve the quality of air in homes and offices. Human exposure to particles in air pollution is responsible for adverse health effects. An important class of indoor particles are nanoaerosols - particles smaller than 100 nanometers in size. New research is needed to better understand the fate and transport of nanoaerosols in buildings to better predict human exposure. The goals of this CAREER development plan are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of indoor nanoaerosols and to inspire a new generation of engineers to solve emerging indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges.

The specific research objectives are to: 1) investigate nOA formation mechanisms down to molecular length scales using state-of-the-art aerosol instrumentation; 2) explore nOA coagulation and condensational growth dynamics; 3) discover how size-resolved nOA phase state is influenced by indoor nOA source type, relative humidity, temperature, and molecular composition; 4) elucidate the role of nOA phase state on hygroscopic growth/shrinkage and filtration kinetics; and 5) characterize nOA dynamics in occupied environments through field campaigns at the Purdue ReNEWW House (Retrofit Net-zero: Energy, Water, and Waste) and Herrick Living Lab offices. This research will transform our ability to observe nOA nucleation events at the nanometer level, thereby establishing how nOA formation, growth, and phase state vary with different indoor nOA sources. New knowledge on how nOA transformations influence deposition on heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters will be produced. This research will utilize full-scale building test systems to understand nOA transport, transformation, and exposure under realistic building operations. An educational framework will be developed that will inspire a new and diverse generation of civil and environmental engineering students to solve IAQ challenges facing the U.S. and global community.

Water and energy are two vital and highly interconnected resources. In the energy-water nexus, innovations in infrastructure and policy can transform cities towards sustainability goals. Moving beyond the traditional sustainability paradigm of the ""green city"" focused primarily on energy, this project aims to create solutions for water sustainability, termed here the ""blue city"". Advancing both water and energy infrastructure systems can be synergistic: the ""blue city"" is to be explored as a component of the ""green city"". To advance sustainability in the built environment, the project plan considers the utility, city, and residential scales to capture the range in different systems science approaches, from top-down and bottom-up perspectives, including the integration between the two approaches. <br/><br/>The integrated research (R) and education (E) objectives are: R1) Characterize the energy sustainability of the water sector in urban areas, using operational data from U.S. cities; R2) Deploy smart water metering systems in residential homes to disaggregate and characterize end uses; R3) Integrate water data with energy data to predict city-scale outcomes from efficiency programs and investments; E1) Develop, implement, and evaluate in-class, online, and informal coursework integrating concepts of water and energy technologies and policies; E2) Organize and implement STEM programming events on water and electricity topics in collaboration with the Girl Scouts of Central Illinois. Outcomes from the research and education objectives are anticipated to generate new, previously unquantified knowledge of the energy-water nexus. At the utility scale, systems science advancements include collecting,organizing, curating, and openly publishing a comprehensive database of treated flow and energy consumption (and recovery, where applicable) at U.S. water and wastewater utilities, and benchmarking direct and indirect water and energy consumption from an urban metabolism perspective. At the residential household scale, innovative expected results include creating characteristic models of residential water demand patterns from a previously unstudied temperate-humid climate, using Chicago as a testbed. Integrating the utility and household scales to the city scale, advancements include predicting resource efficiency outcomes from statistical models correlating electricity and water consumption. Additional contributions include citizen science training and data collection with Girl Scouts and innovative pedagogical approaches to water and energy sustainability curriculum, building on findings from research analyses and producing data to inform research approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flow-borne sound contributes to environmental noise levels that are targets for national and international aircraft noise regulations. However, noise also constrains the commercial footprints of wind turbines, emergent commercial unmanned air vehicles, and new paradigms for efficient urban air travel. To address this challenge, serrated edge designs have been adopted in engineering practice, which can affect both the noise level and the fluid dynamics. An acoustic understanding of serrations based on their flow physics remains underdeveloped, where the prevailing noise theory cannot reliably predict changes in noise level. The principal aim of this project is to develop new theoretical models for how edge serrations affect their local fluid flow and their acoustic signature.<br/><br/>The objectives of the proposed theoretical research program are to: (1) understand via data reduction of noise experiments how serrations distort incoming flow turbulence; (2) model and predict the distortion of flows pertinent to leading edges and trailing edges; and (3) compute the effect of distorted serrations on local unsteady pressures and the radiated noise. The integrated research and education plan aims to furnish a predictive theoretical framework for serration noise generation, which will be coordinated with global research partners for experimental and numerical validation and will provide international research exchange opportunities for graduate students.

Soft jellylike animals called gelatinous grazers specialize in feeding on microorganisms using nets made out of mucus. Gelatinous grazers are abundant in the ocean and have high feeding rates on microorganisms so could have a very strong influence on the abundance and diversity of microorganisms and could change how oceanic food webs are currently understood. However, gelatinous grazers are very fragile and patchy in their distributions so it has been difficult to determine the magnitude and dynamics of these important predator-prey relationships on a meaningful scale using traditional approaches, thus they have typically been disregarded in food web studies. Learning more about the predator-prey relationship between gelatinous grazers and microorganisms will improve understanding of the structure, mechanics, and dynamics of the ocean?s food web, which is a critical economic and ecosystem resource on Earth. This project is determining grazing rates by gelatinous animals on microbes to inform food web models.  The project also trains students to communicate, disseminate, and interpret scientific findings. These broader impacts goals will be attained through partnerships at the University of Oregon (Applied Scientific Communication) and Portland State University (Advanced Technical Writing), training of 1 PhD student, 2 undergraduates, and 4 science communication interns, and development of a week-long workshop and establish student mentorship relationships towards production of communication products.<br/><br/>The project integrates laboratory and oceanographic approaches to address several specific aspects of the predator-prey relationship between gelatinous grazers and ocean microorganisms. Five distinct types of gelatinous grazers, each with different feeding morphologies and life history, will be studied in an oceanographic setting with an abundant and diverse natural microbial population. These target organisms include pelagic tunicates (salps, appendicularians, doliolods and pyrosomes) and thecosome pteropods.  The approach quantifies: 1) grazing rates in the natural ocean environment, 2) particle selectivity with a focus on size and shape and, 3) the morphological and hydrodynamic properties of feeding that underlie the measured grazing rates and particle selection.

This project develops novel algorithms that incorporate educational psychology to help teach humans the knowledge encoded in machine learning algorithms. The project evaluates the two forms of assistance by tracking human performance improvement in user studies.

Current approximations assume ninety percent of mechanical work is converted to heat during deformation due to an incomplete understanding of how nano- and micro-scale deformation mechanisms influence the work to heat conversion process. Computational predictions of material strength and failure during dynamic events, such as rapid metal forming, high-speed machining, and vehicle crash, use the ninety percent approximation, which can be wholly inaccurate. These inaccuracies have potentially hindered the implementation of promising light-weight magnesium alloys as safety critical structural components in automotive, aerospace and railway applications. In this research, a comprehensive understanding of how individual deformation processes contribute to the thermal state of magnesium alloys may allow them to supersede comparatively heavy steel and aluminum components, and thus provide a straightforward path to improved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and fuel-cost savings. As part of the project, the PI will also provide hands-on learning opportunities for underrepresented communities in STEM and support the training of undergraduate and graduate students through research in the laboratory.<br/><br/>Mechanism-based investigations have the potential to account for experimentally observed strain, strain-rate, and loading mode dependencies of the conversion of plastic work to heat. This project will focus on investigating strain and loading mode dependencies using a textured hot-rolled magnesium alloy AZ31B.

Specimens will be deformed adiabatically using a split-Hopkinson pressure bar coupled with ultra-high-speed imaging and multi-point IR thermography. Experiments will provide measures of macroscale mechanical behavior, full-field deformation maps, and local temperature evolution. Post-mortem, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy will be leveraged to identify predominant defect arrangements and defect interactions. Collaboratively, these in-situ measurements and post-mortem observations will enable the PI?s laboratory to achieve the project goal to identify individual mechanism contributions to a deforming material?s thermal state.

Electrons, carrying negative charge, repel one another via the usual Coulomb interaction. However, there are certain circumstances within materials where this repulsive interaction is screened and becomes attractive at certain distances, which can lead to the formation of electron pairs and superconductivity. Yet, the same screened Coulomb interaction also tends to scatter electrons and thereby destroy their coherent motion, which in turn is destructive for superconductivity.<br/><br/>The key goal of this project is to understand the delicate interplay between these two competing tendencies. The PI will analyze specific models relevant to current experiments with the aim to understand when a superconducting state is most stable, and how to increase the temperature at which superconductivity is destroyed, thereby extending the temperature range that is useful for applications. Such understanding could lead to general conclusions about the complex behavior of electrons in materials and is also relevant for practical uses of superconductivity in, for example, energy storage, magnetically levitated trains, superconducting power lines, MRI imaging, and particle accelerators.<br/><br/>The problems the PI proposes to study are quite general and are of interest to a broad community of physicists.

The PI will address several fundamental problems related to physics near a quantum critical point (QCP), where interaction with a critical boson gives rise to strong correlations and non-Fermi-liquid behavior.<br/><br/>The problems considered include the competition between fermionic incoherence and a strong tendency towards Cooper pairing, the interplay between pairing of incoherent fermions and superconductivity, the comparison of analytical theory with Quantum Monte Carlo data, and the special role of backscattering near a critical point. Near a QCP towards spin or charge order, the interaction with soft fluctuations of the order parameter destroys fermionic coherence either on the whole Fermi surface or in some (hot) portions of it. The same interaction also tends to bind fermions into Cooper pairs. The PI's plan is to analyze the competition between these two tendencies. In particular, he will address the issue whether one can get a non-Fermi-liquid behavior down to T=0, uninterrupted by the pairing. He will next study whether the pairing of incoherent fermions leads to true superconductivity or to pseudogap behavior of preformed pairs due to strong fluctuations of a superconducting order parameter. His specific goal is to understand the role of fluctuations of the shape of the frequency dependent gap, as these ""longitudinal"" fluctuations likely become soft at least in some quantum-critical systems. To do this, the PI will derive the full Luttinger-Ward functional, whose minimization yields Eliashberg equations. He  will analyze the profile of this functional away from the minimum and verify whether the stiffness of longitudinal fluctuations has extra smallness at a QCP. If this is the case, there should exist an intermediate temperature range where the pairing gap is already developed, but fermions remain incoherent and do not superconduct. This should answer the most fundamental questions about the behavior of a metal near a QCP.<br/> <br/>The problems the PI proposes to study are quite general and are of interest to a broad community of physicists.

With the advent of online platforms, economic theory emerges as a fundamental approach to promote desirable social properties of efficiency, fairness, and truthfulness in a variety of domains such as shift scheduling, course registration, cloud computing, and crowdsourcing. These new applications are beyond the scope of classical economic theory and market design.  Complex scenarios involving changing preferences, dynamic populations, and online items require novel, practical, and scalable solutions. This project tackles a variety of fundamental problems at the intersection AI and economics while enriching the algorithmic and societal understanding of resource allocation in dynamic settings.  This contrasts with classical mechanisms that either focus solely on economic aspects of resource allocation in static and offline settings or disregarded social aspects such as fairness. New techniques investigated in this project seek to expand the algorithmic aspects of resource allocation and explore the limits of feasibility for dynamic fair allocation.  Advances here can have profound impact in designing efficient mechanisms to allocate resources fairly while incentivizing truthful behavior among the participants.<br/> <br/>Specifically, the project studies two interconnected components: (1) sequential allocation under uncertainty, by synthesizing models studied in AI with economic theory to investigate, analyze, and create new mechanisms that are fair and discourage strategic manipulation in environments where agents' preferences are evolving (e.g. nurse scheduling and course allocation); and (2) online mechanisms, by employing insights from algorithm design and AI to study fairness and efficiency of allocation mechanisms when agents arrive and depart over time or the availability of items is uncertain (e.g. food bank organizations and crowdsourcing platforms). The new techniques aim to exploit the mathematical framework of decision making under uncertainty as well as axiomatic approaches of algorithmic economic and mechanism design to develop theoretical models for dynamic resource allocation, and employ the multiagent design paradigm to investigate the relation between the well-established mechanisms in fair allocation problems. Ultimately, the findings of this research will lead to the development of robust systems for practical applications in dynamic settings that demand efficient and socially desirable decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has indicated limited digital technology use and engineering instruction among elementary teachers. This project addresses two of the seven ITEST guiding questions: student experiences with emerging technologies and instructional and curricular innovations. The Making Engineering Real (ME-REAL) project will develop and implement professional development (PD) to support teachers who work with high populations of underrepresented students in STEM to develop richer, more authentic STEM education through: (a) technology-rich instruction, (b) authentic engineering opportunities, and (c) the development of systems thinking skills. The project will provide guidelines for technology integration within elementary engineering contexts that can inform expectations beyond Virginia. These guidelines will also inform interventions involving secondary teachers to support the development and integration of more comprehensive and increasingly complex technology use within STEM instruction. The project impacts the competencies essential for students to be successful in STEM-related degree programs and careers and is focused on better preparing elementary and secondary science teachers, providing them with valuable instructional tools. Because of this project, students will have more opportunities to engineer within authentic contexts, use relevant technologies in ways that reflect the work of scientists, and think about systems critically. <br/><br/>Prior research indicates teacher beliefs must be elicited and addressed to support changes in instructional practices. However, the question remains as to the extent interventions that incorporate attention to beliefs leads to instructional change. Comparison of ME-REAL teachers' innovation adoption rates to adoption rates cited in other studies in which the intervention included modeling, practice, planning, and coaching, but not attention to beliefs will allow the determination of the extent attending to beliefs promotes instructional change and innovation adoption, especially in the domain of computer simulations. The goal of ME-REAL is to increase and improve 1) elementary teachers' instruction and students' engagement and understanding in the STEM domains of engineering, digital technology, and systems thinking and 2) elementary student science learning among traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM (e.g. rural, Black, Hispanic, low socioeconomic status). Through a delayed-treatment quasi-experimental design, the ME-REAL project will advance the understanding of (1) pedagogies (e.g. digital technology integration) and engineering contexts that effectively support elementary students' systems thinking, (2) PD that facilitates teachers' systems thinking, engineering understandings, and digital technology use, and (3) the extent to which attending to teachers' beliefs during PD promotes instructional change and innovation adoption. Results from this ME-REAL project have implications for designing curricular tools and scaffolds to develop students' critical thinking about systems in all STEM domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coronary artery disease is caused by blockage of one or more blood vessels of the heart by atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaques, which can lead to a heart attack.  Stents are commonly used to treat coronary artery disease patients to prevent closure of the blood vessel.  However, stents also carry clinical complications, often related to delayed healing of the wound that is created in the blood vessel after the stent is introduced.  Endothelial cells, the cells lining the inside of blood vessels, play a key role in wound healing after a stent is introduced into the blood vessel. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to investigate how the blood flow environment around the individual stent struts affects endothelial cells so as to promote or prevent wound healing.  Specifically, the project will study how expression of endothelial cell genes is affected by blood flow adjacent to the stent struts using a combined molecular biology and engineering approach.  This advancement in knowledge will support the development of new treatment approaches to accelerate wound healing after introduction of the stent and decrease the complications associated with stents.  Education and outreach activities will be integrated with the laboratory research.  This award will also foster Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) opportunities at different educational levels, ranging from elementary school to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall research objective is to identify the genetic basis of endothelial cell wound healing in the fluid flow-environment surrounding a stent, a crucial step toward developing targeted therapies for patients after stenting.  The hypothesis being investigated through this award is that the fluid flow environment around the stent strut impedes the normal wound healing process that is directed by endothelial cells.  This will be supported through three research aims.  In aim 1, the project will identify genes that prevent or promote wound healing in an in vitro environment that simulates stents.  In aim 2, the project will develop a unique, high-throughput fluid flow system that will enable testing of multiple genes and flow conditions simultaneously, rapidly advancing the collection of results.  Aim 3 will directly test the genes involved in endothelial cell-directed wound healing by using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-out/knock-in to directly modify gene expression in endothelial cells to rescue directed cell migration and promote wound healing.  The project also includes several educational objectives.  University students will be exposed to the integration of engineering and medicine through courses, and extracurricular laboratory modules will contribute to increased awareness of interdisciplinary STEM careers.  The award will also expand an existing pilot program in STEM for homeschooled elementary students, an often overlooked but rising student population in the US, in order to develop a complementary science curriculum with the goal to reach other homeschooling communities in the state and nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Correspondingly, software quality, which includes both security and reliability, is more important than ever. Software failures can cause significant problems to both individuals and national economies. Security is also a paramount societal concern. This research project helps address quality by improving software modeling, a critical stage in software development where engineers specify what the software does and how it works.  It takes the first step in allowing engineers to leverage knowledge from data in the form of others' experiences and best practices to incorporate established models for use in their software. This project tackles the fundamental issues of how to 1) gather this data properly, 2) derive useful insights about that data, and 3) best present these insights and suggestions to engineers. By providing this assistance and information, engineers can make better-informed decisions, thus yielding higher quality software for all society.  In addition to helping engineers, software modeling is an important aspect of the STEM curriculum, including computer science, software engineering, and other engineering disciplines. Instructors can utilize the approaches and tools derived from this award as a teaching tool by helping students think critically about design decisions.  This will yield better computer scientists and engineers who are more comfortable and versed in formal software modeling.<br/><br/>Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an established formal methodology for building large-scale secure quality software systems.  This award will improve that quality by realizing a cognizant virtual software-modeling assistant to improve software design and MDE.  This project uses model-clone detection to analyze models during development, finds similar models from the same domain and/or best practices, and treats those similar models as training data to reason about in order to suggest model additions and modifications to users. Such assistance will yield similar benefits to those afforded by analogous source-code approaches based on past usage statistics. This involves an exploratory investigation to develop a new approach and prototype virtual software-modeling assistant using an established model clone detector.  In the first phase of this research, the investigator will build a prototype with the capability to analyze incomplete models being constructed/extended by engineers to suggest completed models for insertion based on similarity to those from the same domain and/or best practices.  In the second phase, the investigator will create an assistant that produces granular suggestions based on analyzing similar models, and presents options to engineers of operations they may want to do next based on those operations' prevalence in the knowledge base formed by those similar models.

It centers around a plasma wind-tunnel experiment in which turbulent plasma is generated and launched down a cylindrical column. Measurements of this plasma will be used to better understand the characteristics of plasma turbulence and to compare it to conventional fluid and air turbulence.   The project will also benefit our understanding of plasmas observed in space, such as the solar wind launched by the sun into the solar system, and will help improve prediction of space weather here  on Earth.<br/> <br/>A coaxial plasma gun will be used to generate a stream of magnetized plasma structures called spheromaks down a vacuum chamber, which then evolve via turbulent fluctuations toward relaxation into a Taylor state.

Experimental goals include evaluation and study of the turbulence that is generated as well as establishing this flowing turbulent plasma as an environment in which to study other phenomena - much like the flowing air in a conventional wind-tunnel is used to study aerodynamics. Plans include observations of changes in turbulence in the presence of magnetic dipoles or insulating obstacles, as well as modifications due to injection of energetic particles or waves. Within a controllable laboratory setting, the program seeks to better understand the state of plasma that is observed throughout the solar system - magnetized, turbulent, and fully three-dimensional.

In many cases, the functional properties of these systems derive from the interplay of their spin, charge, orbital, and lattice excitations. In this context, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a powerful tool, capable of simultaneously accessing all of these excitations in a single experiment. But RIXS experiments are difficult to interpret without theoretical models. Moreover, the recent development of pump-probe or time-resolved RIXS experiments has created an urgent need for new theoretical tools. <br/><br/>This CAREER award supports research and education towards the development of new theoretical frameworks for modeling equilibrium and time-resolved RIXS experiments. The primary goals of this project are to extend state-of-the-art numerical methods like the density matrix renormalization group, quantum Monte Carlo, and embedded cluster techniques to model equilibrium RIXS experiments and then integrate these same approaches into new theory for time-resolved RIXS experiments. The research team will apply these methods to address several open problems. Examples include: 1) identifying fractionalized quasiparticle excitations in quantum spin liquids and understanding their dynamics both in and out of equilibrium, 2) determining the specific roles of the collective magnetic and lattice excitations in correlated quantum materials, and 3) establishing how RIXS provides a unique way of answering these questions. Many of these questions will be addressed in the context of ongoing experiments at free electron laser facilities like the Linac Coherent Light Source. This project will provide an advanced framework for understanding RIXS experiments that are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum materials, thus contributing significantly to the understanding of these systems and accelerating future discovery. <br/><br/>This project's educational component focuses on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in advanced physics research.

As such, a fundamental goal in the ocean sciences is increasing our ability to identify marine organic matter's sources, transformations, and sinks, as well as how these components may change due to anthropogenic activities. Understanding these components is especially important in estuarine and coastal systems given these ecosystems are critical zones of organic carbon transformations. However, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in these systems consists of numerous different compounds from a multitude of sources that can turn over at vastly different rates (minutes to millennia).  This makes it difficult to identify which DOC compounds support microbial growth, limiting the incorporation of microbial metabolism into predictive ecosystem models. Novel approaches are therefore needed to identify the DOC substrates driving microbial metabolism in ocean ecosystems. This project is premised on the idea that the bacterial cellular system is the ultimate chemical sensor of the organic environment and that the information recorded in the cell's active gene pool (transcripts) can be leveraged to make insights into DOC composition when the relationships between organic substrate availability, gene activity, and metabolism are known.  This project identifies substrate-transcript relationships for a model marine bacterium, as well as the growth and metabolic outcomes of substrate availability. These insights are used to identify the biologically active DOC substrates in coastal environments when the model organism is added directly to coastal samples, and to interpret both historical and current environmental RNA and DNA data sets.  This work provides novel insights into the substrates driving the ocean's carbon cycle and how marine bacterial cellular systems are regulated.  Bioassays are developed that can be applied in many different aquatic environment settings.  The project trains graduate and undergraduate students directly involved in the research and minority undergraduates will be recruited to use research modules for hands-on study of cell cultivation, bioinformatics, and microbial metabolism. High school students will be engaged through a module developed for an aquatic microbiology field trip and subsequent sample and data analysis.<br/><br/>Bacterial processing of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mediates the flux of gigatons of carbon in the ocean, yet a significant hurdle to incorporating bacterial metabolism into ocean models is the inability to quantify the DOC substrates supporting bacterial metabolism and their transformation.  Metatranscriptomics (sequencing of community mRNAs) has the potential to be a sensitive method for surveying bacterioplankton responses to the DOC pool and making insights into its composition but is currently limited by insufficient knowledge as to how transcriptional patterns relate to substrate availability. This project will identify carbon substrates supporting microbial metabolism and their transformation in estuarine-coastal ecosystems by elucidating the relationships between transcript abundances and carbon substrate availability. It aims to bridge the gap between model organism and environmental -omic studies by creating quantitative inventories of transcripts in response to defined substrates, and then using these calibrated transcriptional signals to interpret environmental DOC bioassays and metatranscriptomes. The first component of the project will establish genome-wide transcript-substrate relationships in a model marine bacterium in response to individual, environmentally-relevant carbon substrates. The second component will determine the extent to which transcription and metabolism are altered when the bacterium is exposed to complex mixtures of defined and undefined substrates, revealing the potential for transcription to identify individual substrates within a complex DOC pool and how metabolic processing may shape the DOC pools labile and refractory components. Finally, these calibrated transcriptional responses will be used to identify the DOC substrates driving bacterial metabolism in an estuarine-coastal system via DOC drawdown bioassays in which the model organism is added to natural seawater samples, as well as community wide bacterioplankton responses to the extant DOC pool via metatranscriptomics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Suddenly, the graphs, charts, and diagrams that provide a quick way to gather information are no longer effective.

The current way that individuals with visual impairments ""read"" graphics is through touch, feeling raised dots and patterns on paper that represent images. Creating these touch-based graphics requires extensive time and resources, and the output provides a static, hard-copy image. Lack of access to graphics in STEM subjects is one of the most pressing challenges currently facing individuals with visual impairments. This is a concern given the low representation of students with these disabilities in STEM fields and professions.<br/><br/>This project investigates how to use new touch technologies, like touchscreens, to create graphics and simulations that can be felt, heard, and seen. Using readily available, low-cost systems, the principal investigator will investigate how to map visual information to touch and sound. This research builds on prior research focused on representing the building blocks of graphics (points, lines, and shapes)  nonvisually. In this project, the investigator will determine how to represent more challenging graphics such as charts, plots, and diagrams, nonvisually. The project will then explore the role of touch feedback in interactive simulations, which have moving elements that change with user input, making nonvisual access challenging. Finally, the projects extends the research to students with other disabilities, toward understanding the benefits and changes necessary for touch technologies to have broad impact. The project involves group and single-subject designs with approximately 65 students with visual impairments and focuses on the following outcomes of interest: students' graph literacy, percent correct on task assessments, time of exploration, response time, number of revisits to particular areas of the graphic, and number of switches between layers.

To construct these programs, software developers must divide each problem into smaller operations and order those operations carefully to compute the correct answer. This ordering can be viewed as a network graph, where each operation points to its next possible operations in order. Furthermore, to make these programs run fast enough to be useful, developers, engineers, and researchers must find new ways to balance those operations with system resources such as storage, processing units, and memory. These resource constraints add more ordering requirements to the graph. Verifying this graph can help avoid bugs. Information inferred from this graph can be used to automatically decrease the time the program requires to run. Thus, people working in computing frequently examine these graphs to generate or validate new ideas about how to write their programs or use computational resources. For example, a programmer may discover a long sequence of operations performed one after another that could be parallelized, thus making the program faster. General approaches for drawing networks have not met the demand of graphs in the computing space, resulting in difficult to interpret, if not unusable, diagrams. The purpose of this project is to develop new graph visualization approaches to better support developers, engineers, and researchers in their work and learners in their understanding of computing and their integration of tools such as graph visualization into their skill sets.<br/><br/>Graphs arising from computing contexts frequently take the form of directed acyclic or near-acyclic graphs (DAG-like graphs). The aim of this project is to develop layout algorithms and design guidelines specifically for this class of computing graphs. Research tasks include surveying graphs generated across computing disciplines to derive a characterization of their structure, their domain-specific sub-structures, and their common drawing conventions. The characterization will guide the development of constraints and objectives for layout of node-link diagrams as well as design guidelines for interactivity and visual encoding in support of domain-specific tasks. The results will be implemented in an open-source library and evaluated for both expressivity of computing structures and computational performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly striking feature of global plant distributions is that sub-Saharan Africa has many fewer plant species than comparable tropical regions in Asia and the Americas, which is known as the ""odd man out"" biogeographic pattern. This research will investigate the possible causes of the odd man out pattern by investigating the evolutionary history of ferns. Ferns are an ancient plant group that occupy diverse ecosystems globally. Consequently, they are ideal models for understanding the roles of extinction, speciation and migration in generating the modern-day flora of sub-Saharan Africa. Broader impacts of the project will build research capacity among early career scientists, including post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Florida and strengthen biodiversity science education within diverse K-12 and college classrooms.

Species will be sampled in the field and from herbaria; DNA sequence data from approximately 450 nuclear markers will be used to generate their phylogenies. The resulting phylogenies will be used to reconstruct historical biogeographic movements of over 1000 species, calculate diversification rates, and determine whether shifts in ancestral ecological niche envelopes correlate with migration events or changes in diversification rate. Ancestral climate reconstructions and trait data from common garden experiments will be co-analyzed to understand how climate may have shaped traits and diversification patterns over time.

As applications of machine learning algorithms for decision-making broaden and diversify, the requirements on security, fairness, interpretability and generalization have been pushed to higher standards. These emerging issues have brought great challenges to the design of machine learning algorithms in the presence of big and complex data.  Traditional machine learning methods by minimizing an unconstrained or simply constrained convex objective have become increasingly unsatisfactory. This project seeks to advance learning with complex objectives and constraints by designing and analyzing efficient and effective optimization algorithms for addressing computational challenges in new machine learning paradigms.

The technical aims of the project are divided into two thrusts. The first thrust is to (i) develop faster and provable stochastic algorithms for learning with complicated non-convex objectives, and (ii) improve the generalization performance of deep learning by advanced regularization and compression methods through design of efficient optimization algorithms. The second thrust is to (i) design computationally efficient constrained optimization algorithms for learning with complicated and complex constraints, and (ii) investigate their applications in adversarial learning, fair learning, interpretable learning, etc. The optimization tools and techniques developed will enable more advanced regularization and loss minimization methods in machine learning, and should greatly influence other areas, such as operations research, signal processing, data mining, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management cognitive bias plays in design process, and to identify and test means to mitigate that bias. Error management biases decision-making toward errors that are less costly. In design practice, error management may relate to concerns like self-preservation of one's livelihood or conservation of resources. Cognitive-based engineering design studies are performed with the perspective that if we can understand the way that designers think and work, we will be able to determine the practices, methods, tools, environments, and stimulation that lead to the best design output. Error management bias is a permeating presence in all human decision-making, and a clearer picture of its effects on design could fundamentally improve the way design problems are solved. A deeper, more complete understanding of the role of error management bias in design will also enhance design education techniques and learning outcomes. The educational objective of this CAREER award is to contribute to increasing the diversity of STEM fields, with particular focus on strengthening the pipeline through programming for K-12 girls and young women and racial minorities. In partnership with the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA, a three-part project will be executed: 1) engage a diverse national audience of children in Title I schools through a puppet-based, STEM-focused Distance Learning curriculum; 2) provide a local interactive, puppet-based, STEM education experience geared toward girls and minority children in the Atlanta area; and 3) provide a service learning experience for Georgia Tech engineering undergraduate students to engage in mentorship of girls and minority children through a cooperative STEM puppet exhibit design course. Through the these educational activities, underrepresented K-12 students, locally and nationally, will gain more interest in, and self-efficacy for, pursuing STEM studies and careers. Ultimately, by increasing diversity in STEM fields, more successful teams and innovation outcomes will be possible.<br/><br/>This research is focused on furthering the development of new fundamental knowledge in the areas of design theory and methodology to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management bias plays in the way design practice is performed and learned. Error management biases can include loss aversion bias, status quo bias, context-dependent preferences and many more. The specific goals are: 1) to gain a deeper understanding of the role that error management bias plays in design process; 2) to identify means to mitigate error management bias in the design process; and 3) to test and validate the means to mitigate error management bias in the design process. In design practice, error management bias could be beneficial, or dangerous, when it comes to decision-making. When approaching the study of error management biases in design, it will be important not only to recognize when, where and how these biases manifest, but also the potential impact of the biases on the design outcomes--which may not necessarily be negative. This research approach is centered on in-situ, ethnographic, and laboratory based studies of design practice in novices and expert designers to uncover and study the most prevalent forms of error management biases in design, as well as techniques for their mitigation, in detail. By studying error management biases in design more broadly and deeply, researchers and practitioners will be able to understand and improve design practice for more objective, rational actions and decision-making and, ultimately, better design innovation outcomes. This research will help to open up a broad, relatively unexplored area of inquiry in design theory and methods research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, prescribed opioids for treating pain have led to the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse, costing $500 billion annually in medical, economic, social and criminal ramifications. The most serious side effects of opioids, including physical dependence and addiction, arise from un-intended effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Pain is generally evoked from the periphery and thus targeting the peripheral nervous system (PNS) could alleviate pain without un-intended CNS effects. However, drug-based treatments to selectively target the PNS remain largely unsuccessful. Peripheral neuromodulation treats chronic pain by focused delivery of physical energy (usually electrical current) to PNS tissues. However, current peripheral neuromodulation methods are unpredictable and only benefit a fraction of chronic pain patients. This project aims to develop novel experimental and computational tools to advance our mechanistic understanding of peripheral neuromodulation, and thus will provide new experimental and theoretical data to improve neuromodulation for benefiting a broader patient population with chronic pain. This project will also educate the public on neuromodulation as an alternative to opioids and engage K-12, undergraduate and graduate students with pain-related STEM education and research.  Activities include: educating K-8 students about the importance of getting proper medical care and physical therapy after injury to reduce chances of developing chronic pain later in life; educating athletic coaches in partner schools to increase awareness of overt pain in children as a risk factor not only for chronic pain, but also for opioid abuse later in life; creating a website to amplify this message to coaches and parents of K-8 students nationwide and hosting an annual one week workshop for high school teachers on the science of pain and non-drug treatment of pain.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term career research goal is to significantly advance understanding of the biophysics of peripheral nerves/neurons in physiological and pathophysiological conditions in the context of engineering interventions like multi-modal neuromodulation and electrode-nerve interfaces. Toward this goal, this project is to experimentally determine selective activation/inhibition of peripheral neuromodulation via bioelectrical recording from individual nerve axons (single-unit recordings) in harvested mouse peripheral nerves and develop computational simulations to predict selective activation/inhibition. The central hypothesis is that the selectivity of peripheral neuromodulation on subgroups of peripheral neurons/axons is determined by their different neural functions and anatomical environments surrounding each neuron/axon. The Research Plan is organized under two objectives. The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to quantify selective activation/inhibition of peripheral neuromodulation ex vivo.  Novel methods will be established for simultaneous single-unit recordings from both afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) axons at the dorsal and the ventral nerve root, and for single unit optical recordings at cell bodies of sensory neurons.  Nerve axons will be functionally classified into low-threshold afferents, nociceptors (injury sensing afferents) and efferents, and their conduction velocities will be established.  The effect of neuromodulation on identified classes of axons will be tested to map previously unknown mechanistic relationships between neuromodulation and altered peripheral neural functions.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to predict selective activation/inhibition of peripheral neuromodulation in vivo and validate with measured behavioral outcomes. A multi-scale computational model will be established by coupling finite element (FE) analysis with neural simulation to predict the effect of neuromodulation on action potential (AP) propagation along peripheral neurons/axons. The model will incorporate macroscopic (e.g., bones) and microscopic (e.g., connective tissues) environments of individual axons as determined by X-ray tomography and histology. The model will be used to  predict the effectiveness of various neuromodulation schemes to selectively activate/inhibit afferent subgroups. Model predictions will be validated with behavioral assays in mice undergoing noxious colorectal distension and peripheral neuromodulation. Outcomes of this research will establish a novel theoretical understanding of peripheral neuromodulation, which will likely accelerate development of new neuromodulation schemes, techniques and modalities that target the PNS to manage diseases like chronic pain while limiting off-target side effects. Through improved selectivity, neuromodulation devices can maximize their advantage over drugs (e.g., minimal off-target side effects) and become a widespread treatment option for patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major scientific barrier to achieving greater efficiencies in pool boiling processes is the limited understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms at the small length and time scales associated with the generation of individual vapor bubbles. In this project, an innovative approach to pool boiling experimentation will provide temperature, heat flux, and liquid-vapor phase interface information from beneath individual vapor bubbles. This project will provide better understanding of the underlying physical processes which can be used to improve pool boiling processes at larger scales. In coordination with efforts in the laboratory, this project also supports strategic experiential learning and outreach initiatives for K-12 and undergraduate students related to the fundamentals of thermal energy, with special emphasis on measuring how these activities affect student understanding. Through these initiatives, educators will gain valuable insight into how students from different backgrounds best learn about the thermal sciences, thereby improving student success and increasing participation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines within both traditional and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The overall scientific objective of this project is to obtain a deep understanding of the timing and relative importance of the various modes of heat transfer associated with bubble nucleation, growth, and departure for both single and coalesced bubble conditions. This is achieved via a family of microfabricated test devices with thermal- and phase interface-sensing features centered on one or more artificially created nucleation sites, with sensor outputs temporally coupled to a high-speed imaging system. This provides a means of unlocking key insights into the complex interplay between liquid, vapor, and solid during pool boiling processes including long-debated questions regarding the behavior and roles of the moving contact line, microscale contact angles, and microlayer behavior in nucleate boiling heat transfer. The versatility of this method allows it to be employed to study a wide range of boiling phenomena, regimes, conditions, and multiscale surface modifiers, thereby making for a valuable new set of capabilities that can provide a high level of productivity and benefit to the greater scientific community.

The current strategy for design of granular crystals and other metamaterials focuses on optimizing fixed structures for specific applications such as shock absorption and impact protection. This program presents a significant change in design philosophy to sense-adapt-recover approach where granular crystals would adapt their internal structure using external fields based on basic sensor data (velocity, direction of incoming projectile) to achieve a specified objective (such as protection from incoming projectile) and revert to their original state. This will help transform the design of hazard protection gear (such as vests, helmets) for military, sport and construction sectors, impact/shock protection systems for underground / underwater infrastructure and excellent lightweight alternative for structural damping in various civilian and defense applications.

Although it is a key activity in engineering, the fundamentals of how engineers utilize objective data to inform inherently subjective judgments about the system during verification is not well understood. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research into this process and education efforts geared towards improving understanding about and skills for verification activities. The research focus is on modeling the information structures by which engineers build confidence in a system's performance. This knowledge can lead to improved verification strategies and more rigorous ways to evaluate verification data. Hence, the research activities can bring about a potentially transformative paradigm for the practice of systems engineering. Improved verification strategies benefit society by enabling efficient system development with a more robust verification coverage, which may lead to increased safety and efficacy of commercial products and public services and greater overall economic competitiveness. The innovative education paradigm introduced in this project embeds verification into regular engineering assignments to prepare students to exercise sound judgement and be effective decision makers in engineering. Middle school students are engaged with a computer game that teaches conceptual diversity beyond calculations. By realizing that no single answer exists for an engineering problem, students embrace the potential diversity in engineering solutions and focus on understanding how prior knowledge, mental models, preferences, and team member attitudes shape the meaningfulness of their solutions. <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER project is to study the formation of engineers' beliefs during systems engineering verification activities and to identify patterns and heuristics that better enable engineers to capture their beliefs in information artifacts. Explanatory models of how engineers' beliefs form will be established by combining Bayesian analyses, traditional and dynamic belief graphs, and decision theory with empirical observations of professional engineers and information artifacts (e.g., verification plans and reports). Cognitive mapping will be used to elicit belief structures, Bayesian analysis will be employed to model engineers' beliefs, and Credal sets will be used to account for differing engineers' beliefs.  The educational objective of this project is to help students recognize and embrace the subjective (yet non-arbitrary) nature of correctness in engineering problems. Novel instructional approaches to two key populations for engineering will be implemented and assessed. A digital game to model real-world contexts as math word problems will be used to seek and capture the conceptual diversity that emerges when middle school students cooperate while solving problems. Undergraduate students will be exposed to open-ended problems that foster a solution-verification iterative approach to engineering in several courses from their freshmen to senior years.

Particle rigidity and shape are crucial parameters that dictate specific biological functions, and controlling them could allow comprehensive optimization of capsules for delivery of medications.  To date, regulating rigidity (stiffness) of hydrogel particles by varying their shapes has presented a major challenge due to the lack of mechanical stability of shape-defined hydrogel structures.  The key task of this research is to understand how stiffness of microcapsules can be controlled by structural characteristics including non-spherical curvature, edge and facet number, and overall shape.  The proposed research will impact the development of micro-sized hydrogels of complex shapes that can provide a powerful means to mimic key properties of biological systems and hold potential as cell-mimicking particles to be developed into artificial cells and multifunctional delivery carriers.  The design of these capsules also offers prospects for developing materials with unique actuation characteristics having applications in polymer and materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical biology.  The educational objective of the project is to enhance a discovery-driven multidisciplinary polymer science program at UAB, to promote student training from the high school through graduate-level in modern aspects of chemistry, polymer science, and materials science, and to broaden recruitment of historically underrepresented populations.  These efforts will also help to increase public awareness of nanoscale polymeric materials and to train the next generation of the STEM workforce in the southeast.<br/><br/>  <br/>	<br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis of geometry-controlled rigidity in hollow hydrogel microcapsules and to gain fundamental understanding of pressure-induced capsule shape transitions (buckling) at a molecular-level.  Current approaches aim to control the stiffness of hydrogel particles mainly by choice of polymer, fluid content, and crosslink density.  The objectives of the proposed study are: (i) to determine how pressure-induced shape transformations are affected by physicochemical properties of the capsule wall (shell) in vertices-free non-spherical capsules; (ii) to understand how pressure-induced shape transitions are influenced by the physicochemical properties of the capsule shell in vertices-reinforced capsules; and  (iii) to discover how capsule shell rigidity can be controlled via the internal structure of the multilayer hydrogel shell.  Dimensional and shape changes defined by negative volume changes (shrinkage and buckling instability) in response to increasing osmotic pressure will be investigated using an osmotic pressure difference method.  The impacts of crosslink density, chain persistence length, shell hydration and architecture on the hydrogel stability against osmotic pressure-induced buckling (shape loss) and shape recovery after stress removal will be studied.  The fundamental relationships between the geometry-controlled rigidity and pressure-induced shape transitions will be explored using a combination of in-situ techniques including atomic force and confocal microscopy, ellipsometry, nanoindentation, neutron scattering, and ATR-FTIR.  The expected collaborative effort with the UAB medical community will provide valuable opportunities for two-way feedback between the research on fundamental material properties and testing materials performance for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the interactions between the two separate phases (solid sugar and liquid coffee in this example) results in complex mixing processes that occur at both large and small length scales. In many engineering and natural applications, this mixing is induced by shock waves, resulting in rapid mixing and phase change. Understanding multiphase mixing processes can help scientists better understand natural problems like supernovae and volcanic eruptions, and improve engineering applications, such as steam turbines used to produce electric power and advanced jet engine designs used for military aircraft. This work will use a simplified experiment to study the role of particle characteristics (like size) in shock-driven mixing. Experimental measurements will be used to validate new models for multiphase mixing and to ensure the accuracy of computer simulations. These simulations can then be used to study additional problems in multiphase mixing. Additionally, this work will have a broader impact by preparing engineering students to be leaders in their careers and communities. This will be accomplished through several initiatives, including developing a high school classroom lesson on fluids mixing; recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups; and organizing a national security research symposium to help students and faculty apply research toward national defense.  <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER project is to test the hypothesis that shock-driven turbulent mixing can be enhanced by the inclusion of a prescribed multiphase component. This project will use an integrated experimental and simulation approach to develop a new theory establishing the relationship between small-scale particle-driven mechanisms and large-scale hydrodynamic mechanisms in strongly accelerated multiphase mixing with evaporation.  Experiments will be performed in the PI?s shock tube facility where measurements of hydrodynamic and particle mixing will be made. Simulations will be performed using the PI?s previously developed particle models, validated by the experimental measurements. The work will be broken into three tasks: 1) Determine the effect of particle velocity relaxation time on hydrodynamic mixing; 2) Determine the effect of hydrodynamic mixing on particle evaporation; and 3) Determine the effect of vapor production on mixing from secondary accelerations. Using these measurements, the simulation particle models will be validated and used to explore additional experimentally inaccessible measures and a wider parameter space. Both experimental and simulation results will be used to develop and test new theory to predict gas and vapor/particle mixing in hydrodynamic and turbulent regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mutualistic microbes are important to human health because of the importance of microbes that live in and on our bodies. They impact human welfare, for example because of the role of microbes associated with high-yielding crop plants. These examples demonstrate the fundamental importance of microbial mutualisms to human flourishing.  Surprisingly, very little is understood about how such mutualisms are born, or the conditions that are important in their formation. This project will investigate how mutualistic relationships form and become established at the genetic level. It will explore how environmental factors impact the evolution and stability of these new mutualisms.  Insights from this work may be relevant for biodiversity conservation efforts and for the management of invasive species in light of environmental change.  This project will also facilitate the growth and development of initiatives aimed at improving STEM education practices and STEM preparedness of graduate, undergraduate, high school, and community college transfer students, that build upon the Principal Investigator's existing efforts to improve the STEM success landscape in Mississippi.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator created a new mutualism based on carbon and nitrogen exchange between two model microbes, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a system with an unprecedented degree of experimental and genetic tractability.  Using this system, this project will elucidate how nascent mutualistic relationships are consolidated at the genetic level and investigate the impact of (1) carbon and nitrogen nutrient availability, (2) historical contingency (i.e., prior evolutionary history), and (3) gene flow/migration (between communities adapted to different local environmental conditions) on the coevolution of mutualism.  This work will experimentally test ideas underlying Thompson's Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution, and address several questions, including: (i) how do environmental conditions and/or the degree of interspecies dependency (obligate or facultative) influence coevolutionary trajectories and the distribution of adaptive genetic changes among partners?  (ii) To what degree does prior mutualistic evolutionary history canalize or limit the possibilities for subsequent evolutionary adaptation?  (iii) How does genetic mixing of partners that have evolved under different sets of conditions influence subsequent coevolutionary outcomes compared to cases where there is no gene flow?  An integral part of this project includes efforts to: (1) enhance undergraduate and graduate education in evolution and genomics, (2) improve academic preparedness and success of community college transfer students, and (3) catalyze STEM interest and college readiness among low-income high school students, notably from the Mississippi Delta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their useful oil- and water-repellent properties, PFAS are used in many consumer products, industrial processes, and in firefighting foams. These uses have led to their release to the environment through multiple pathways. The carbon-fluorine bonds in PFAS make them extremely durable, so they do not naturally break down in the environment. Conventional drinking water treatment is not effective at removing most PFAS from water. This is of particular concern because some PFAS are known to cause harm. They can build up in the bodies of humans and wildlife, disrupt normal development, and impair the immune system. Yet no reliable information is available about the properties and health impacts of most PFAS. Recent estimates suggest that more than 4000 different PFAS may have been used and released over time. Detailed toxicity testing data are available for only a handful of these. It is therefore critical that we build our knowledge base regarding the potential impacts of PFAS and identify effective ways of removing them from the environment. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to tackle the enormous challenge posed by PFAS through an innovative complementary approach using predictive modeling and experiments. The results of this study will transform our understanding of PFAS behavior with broad benefits to society through better design of products to reduce environmental impacts at greatly reduced cost. <br/><br/>The objectives of this CAREER proposal are threefold: (1) to use molecular and organism-scale models to conduct large-scale predictive screening of PFAS hazard; (2) to use this new knowledge of structure-interaction relationships to design new bio-inspired sorbents to remove PFAS from water; and (3) to reimagine K-12 and undergraduate education through the use of collaborative model-building in a game-like environment. An experimental, chemical-by-chemical approach to building a comprehensive PFAS knowledge base would be extremely costly in terms of time, laboratory animals, and resources needed. This would delay action in preventing the release of potentially harmful chemicals that could persist indefinitely in the environment without active treatment. By leveraging the power of molecular dynamics to rank the strength of PFAS-biomolecule interactions, coupled to organism-scale physiological models, those PFAS most likely to accumulate in specific tissues or elicit a receptor-specific toxic impact can be rapidly identified. Further, strong interactions with particular biological molecules can be used to design an entirely novel class of selective sorbents. This capitalizes on the very property that makes PFAS hazardous (their tendency to bind to biological macromolecules like proteins) to remove them from water in an efficient and targeted way. Moreover, the broad structural knowledge base that will be created during this CAREER program can be leveraged to 'design out' hazardous properties in future chemicals. Throughout this research program, the power of modeling and simulation will engage and inspire thousands of middle and high school students and their teachers through both formal educational programs and informal STEM outreach, and will be used to enhance systems-level thinking and self-confidence among undergraduates, thereby enhancing the recruitment and retention of diverse cohorts of future STEM leaders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on improved catalysts for expanding the ethanol market by converting the ethanol to value-added derivatives such as acetic acid.  Specifically, the project will study the interactions between gold nanoparticles and metal oxide catalyst supports to gain fundamental understanding that will be used to design more active and selective catalysts for acetic acid production.  The fundamental knowledge gained in this project will contribute to the long-term sustainability of U.S. bioethanol plants. Mechanistic insights will also provide better general understanding of metal-support interactions involving noble metals in applications such as automotive exhaust oxidation catalysis. The research is integrated with an educational plan that provides training and leadership opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students through research and community engagement.<br/><br/>The project addresses the effects of charge transfer processes in heterogeneous catalysis. The limited number of experimental tools to assess in situ charge transfer rates and their kinetic relevance for surface catalyzed reactions has been a major obstacle for advancing the understanding of metal-support interactions. Three enabling spectroscopic techniques have been developed to facilitate 1) in situ evaluation of adsorbed oxygen on gold catalysts (Gold-Surface Plasmon Resonance-UV-visible spectroscopy, i.e. Au-SPR-UV-vis), 2) identify surface reaction intermediates (Modulation Excitation-Phase Sensitive Detection-Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, i.e. ME-PSD-DRIFTS), and charge transfer between metal and support (Modulation Excitation-Phase Sensitive Detection-UV-visible spectroscopy, i.e. ME-PSD-UV-vis). This project will systematically examine electronic and structural metal-support effects by studying a variety of catalysts while isolating gold particle size, support nature, and catalyst synthesis method. It is hypothesized that supports with n-type semiconducting properties facilitate charge transfer from and to the gold nanoparticle periphery, thereby promoting active species that oxidize ethanol to acetic acid. Overall, the combination of Au-SPR-UV-vis, ME-PSD-FTIR, ME-PSD-UV-vis, spectrokinetics, and reaction kinetics will provide a comprehensive mechanistic view of gas phase ethanol oxidation to describe the observed activity and selectivity trends. The new knowledge and techniques will assist in the design of next-generation gold oxidation catalysts. They will also be transferable to other oxidation reactions, thus expanding their applicability to a wide range of surface catalyzed reactions. The research and educational programs will produce a trained cadre of diverse students to enter the workforce in STEM disciplines. A new outreach after-school science initiative, EMPower (Energy, Matter, & Power) club, will also provide undergraduate students with leadership opportunities while serving as role models and mentors for elementary school children from underrepresented groups and low-income backgrounds. The initiative will serve as a catalyst to spark children's curiosity through hands-on activities to let them appreciate science with fun activities and inspire them to pursue education in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems. Hodge theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry but it is fundamentally transcendental in nature.  Recent work of the PI and coauthors has demonstrated that techniques from model theory and complex geometry can be used to bridge this divide systematically, and the first goal of the project is to develop the application of these techniques more deeply. Secondly, the project will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian varieties and hyperkahler varieties.

One particular issue involves scheduling:  what is the most effective way to assign resources, say computing cycles, to tasks in order to ensure good performance?  The scheduling problem is especially acute when little to nothing is known in advance about the tasks, including when they might arrive and how much compute time they may need; in such cases, dynamic allocation of resources is required.  Over the past two decades, exciting advances in approaches for addressing these so-called on-line scheduling problems have emerged, but the field is still struggling to address the increasingly challenging scheduling environments found in modern computing clusters.  This project aims to develop new methods to design and analyze online scheduling algorithms systematically with the aid of widely used optimization techniques, and as a result to potentially resolve some key open questions in online scheduling.  The research findings will likely provide an alternative method of educating students on scheduling in a broad context, which will have a significant impact on the computer science curriculum. This project will also involve mentoring students and disseminating the research outcomes through workshops, writing tutorials, and developing new course materials.<br/> <br/>At a more technical level, this project intends to investigate the effectiveness of online scheduling techniques for a variety of problems.  The project's first objective is to develop new gradient-descent methods to design and analyze online-scheduling. The second objective is to use bin-packing to study fundamental admission-control problems, and to develop new algorithmic tools when pre-emption is allowed. The third research problem to be studied involves the development of fine-grained scheduling algorithms for low-dimensional scheduling environments. Surprisingly, despite recent advances, many existing algorithms are no match even for the simplest greedy algorithms in the low-dimensional case, which is common in practice. The fourth research goal is to refine the behavior of the online algorithms as the workload approaches the system limit, which is related to fundamental questions regarding the underlying analysis models. The last goal is to explore new models for scheduling jobs with inter-dependencies by taking advantage of large-scale scheduling environments to circumvent the intractability results that are commonly found in the traditional models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials can be porous at the scale of single molecules, making them strong candidates for the storage of gasses and for separation technologies; preliminary work suggests that they may also provide a valuable scaffold for applications in renewable energy harvesting and conversion. For example, these frameworks of molecules may be used to anchor and orient the light-absorbing parts of a material for efficient energy transfer or increased energy storage density. This project will accelerate the development of this promising class of materials for renewable energy applications by providing a targeted computer simulation strategy to predict the behavior of electrons in these materials after they absorb visible light.<br/>The PI mentors a team of undergraduate and Master's student researchers in the development and application of simulations. Their cross-disciplinary training will contribute to the preparation of a robust STEM workforce in the physical and computational sciences. The goals of this research also directly integrate with the PI's efforts as an educator to enhance energy literacy among undergraduate and high school students. Educational simulations that illustrate the energy conversion mechanisms at play in the materials studied here will be developed in collaboration with student researchers; employed in the PI's energy, materials, and chemistry classrooms; and shared with the public to broaden access to energy science resources. These research and educational objectives are directly linked to an undergraduate student-driven energy literacy outreach initiative, recently established by the PI at WWU, which will be further enhanced through development into a service learning program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research on optical and electronic properties of covalent organic frameworks. The rational design of photoactive and electroactive covalent organic frameworks is hindered by a lack of predictive models at extended length and time scales to link the optical and electronic properties of these frameworks to their underlying structure. This project aims to address this knowledge gap through the development of a multireference computational approach that strategically links semiempirical ground- and excited-state electronic structure calculations to predict photophysical properties, energy transfer, and charge carrier mobility in electroactive and photoactive covalent organic frameworks. The approach builds on the PI's implementation of a time-independent approach to low-lying excited states in density-functional tight-binding to incorporate charge-transfer excitations as well as couplings between electronic states in these materials. This constrained density-functional tight-binding based configuration interaction (CDFTB-CI) approach will be deployed to study photoexcitation and electron/energy transfer in selected covalent organic frameworks as singlet fission materials and as photoswitchable energy storage materials. The models developed and applied here will also provide a partial blueprint for computational materials scientists to quantify links between structural and electronic properties in other topologically complex environments such as metal-organic frameworks.<br/>This project will directly enable the training and mentoring of a diverse group of 15-20 undergraduate and masters-level research students at a primarily undergraduate institution. To broaden the educational impact of this work and to communicate energy conversion and storage concepts to the public, the PI will create and assess the effectiveness of augmented materials simulations that support fluency in mathematical and physical models of energy conversion. This project will also establish a sustainable trajectory for the PI's Energy Ambassadors initiative, a program that couples undergraduate research across the science, engineering, economics, policy, and business of energy with cross-disciplinary communication skill-building and K-12 outreach.<br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This landscape was transformed by human activities through extensive subsurface ""tiling"" (drainage piping) and intensified uses of fertilizer and other inputs.  However, this transformation has also created important questions about environmental sustainability. With further stress from climate change, can the US Midwest remain as the global food basket for the next 100 years? How can food production and environmental quality both be sustained in this landscape?  In the US Midwest agroecosystem, carbon (e.g. crop growth), hydrology (both water quantity and quality), and nutrient cycles are all closely intertwined across scales, from the field/headwater scale to the whole river (greater Mississippi river basin) network and continental scales.  Any human activities and practices do not just affect one component, rather the complete set of interconnections.  Thus, a ""system"" analysis of the complex feedbacks and interactions is required to assess potential adaptations in the US Midwest agroecosystem. This project adopts a system view to holistically model and quantify the coupled ""food-water-nutrient nexus"" for the US Midwest agroecosystem.  These models will significantly advance the understanding of the processes and predict agroecosystem behavior under current and future climate conditions.  Two promising management practices (i.e. controlled drainage, and nutrient management) to achieve co-sustainability of food production and environmental quality will be assessed<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the research is to establish an advanced understanding of how crop growth, hydrology, and nutrient cycles  interact under different human management and climate conditions in the setting of the US Midwest agroecosystem. The project will  develop a coupled land-river model and a model-data fusion approach, and integrate field-level collected data and remote sensing measurements. Specifically, tile drainage extent and drainage strength will be estimated in a spatially explicit manner at the regional scale for the three key states in the US Midwest, by a new model-data fusion approach based on ecohydrological processes. This dataset of tile drainage will then be used to develop a coupled land-river network model (ecosys-THREW) to quantify feedbacks/interactions among the water cycle, nitrogen cycle, and crop production across spatial scales in this agroecosystem, as well as to assess the potential of promising human management practices to allow co-sustainability of food production and environment quality in the US Midwest. Simulation results from the coupled ecosys-THREW model are expected to be used by policy makers and farmer communities to assess the agroecosystem conditions and potential impacts of various conservation practices at the regional scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a development will increase our ability to control practical systems. Due to physical and technological limitations, available ways of perturbing a mechanical system are often constrained. For example, it is difficult to individually force single atoms in order to control a molecular system. On the other hand, partial intervention is often easier; for instance, an oscillatory electromagnetic field can interact with charged atoms and induce perturbations to the system, which are however in restricted forms. When the available perturbations are restricted, they may be inadequate to induce immediate favorable changes to the system. However, the key idea is that, if introduced at a smaller scale, perturbations can accumulate and contribute in less restrictive ways to the original scale. Based on this idea, the project develops a framework for designing the perturbation so that its accumulated effect can alter the system's macroscopic behavior in a desired fashion. Numerical computations and the development of computational tools will also be seamlessly integrated with the theoretical analysis. To illustrate the innovation of the proposed research, note that traditional control theory is still important, albeit insufficient, because the control is introduced at a microscopic level, yet one needs and only needs to control the system's macroscopic behavior. Brute-force computational search for the optimal control will also be practically infeasible due to the wide breadth of scales presented in the system. The research is to use theoretical analysis (based on tools from fields such as dynamical systems and multiscale methods) to either directly design or accelerate the computational search of control strategies. The study will also be complemented by investigations in multiple interdisciplinary applications, such as DNA deactivation, remote control of locomotion, temporal metamaterials, and recovery of material defects. Research will be integrated with education across multiple institutions and over the spectrum of academic levels. Specifics are planned for broadening women and underrepresented groups' participation and disseminating knowledge beyond PI's immediate institute or discipline.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project identifies (mostly-)oscillatory perturbations for accomplishing various control tasks, such as to steer a system from a macroscopic state to another, or to track a desired dynamic behavior at the macroscopic level for all time. The main methodology is to design microscopic perturbations that resonantly interact with the system, so that nontrivial effects cascade to the macroscopic scale. The PI has already obtained several preliminary results on this idea, and the proposed theory will be a generalization. The strategy of investigation is to first quantify how small-scale perturbations effectively accumulate at large-scale using dynamical systems tools, asymptotic/multiscale methods, and numerical computations, followed by the patching together of the local understandings for the global objective of control design. An example of core tasks is to identify and then track slowly-varying resonant frequencies in nonlinear systems. Integrable, nearly-integrable, and stochastic systems will be considered, so that an ambitious goal of controlling complicated dynamics can be gradually approached.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Change-point analysis is a crucial early step in analyzing these data sequences, such as, to raise an alarm when an abnormal event happens in online data monitoring, and to segment a long sequence into more homogeneous parts for follow-up studies.  To accommodate modern applications, the ability to deal with high throughput data and data with complicated structures is becoming a necessity.  Parametric methods usually cannot be applied to very high dimensions unless strong assumptions are made to avoid the estimation of a large number of nuisance parameters.  This project focuses on developing non-parametric change-point detection methods that are free of strong assumptions and computationally scalable to high dimensional and complex data.  This project provides students and researchers with exciting new research problems that have both statistical and scientific importance.  The training component for undergraduate and graduate students will prepare new researchers with inter-disciplinary education.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new scan statistic framework through a novel adaptation of graph-based methods.  The PI has shown that the graph-based approaches scale to high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data, and allow for universal analytic permutation p-value approximations that is decoupled from application-specific modeling, facilitating their applications to large and complicated data sets.  Despite the good properties of the graph-based methods, there are still some gaps between its current versions and many modern applications. This project aims to fill those important gaps.  In particular, this project will (1) develop new graph-based approaches to effectively integrate information from multiple sources, which is common in many application areas, such as smart homes and smart cities, and seek ways to distribute the new approaches to local centers to avoid the excessive transmission of raw data in a distributed system; (2) develop treatments from the level of constructing the graph to deal with dependent data, which is more effective than a circular block permutation framework developed by the PI earlier; and (3) develop a new framework to provide analytic power approximations to the graph-based methods that kick in for sample sizes in hundreds and thousands even for high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean data, facilitating researchers to make better decisions in real applications.  These methodological and theoretical developments will provide better understandings of modern complicated data sequences from diverse fields, which will further advance the understanding of major scientific problems in these fields.  The tools developed in this project will be distributed as open source software packages with detailed documentations.  This will enhance the collaboration between the statistics community and researchers from broader scientific fields, and make data analysis procedures more transparent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetism is a phenomenon associated with the electron's tiny intrinsic magnetic moment, called spin. In the best-known magnetic materials, such as iron, electrons in the material have their spins lined up parallel to each other and produce magnetic fields at macroscopic scales. We experience these through their magnetic forces. In another class of magnetic materials, spins line up anti-parallel with their neighbors. Such materials do not exhibit macroscopic magnetic forces, but their behavior can still be understood within a classical framework. <br/><br/>Frustration in the context of magnetism is a technical term that denotes the existence of competing forces at the microscopic level. Frustration can destabilize any arrangement of spin order and lead to far more complex behavior. Quantum mechanics is essential for describing such magnetic phases. Materials having these magnetic phases can harbor new types of particles and show new types of responses to temperature changes, electric current, or electromagnetic fields. They could provide platforms for a new generation of quantum devices. <br/><br/>In recent years, many such quantum magnetic materials have been synthesized and are being studied. However, real materials always come with imperfections or impurities. Such impurities can sometimes degrade and sometimes stabilize exotic properties.

These techniques include series expansions and numerical linked cluster expansions developed by the PI and his group. By calculating thermodynamic properties such as entropy and specific heat, dynamical properties such as spin-currents and spin-diffusion, and various response and scattering properties, the work should provide quantitative support to various experimental studies including transport, neutron scattering and NMR experiments.

For example, to understand the statement, ""Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,"" a robot needs to understand that the first ""on"" expresses the topic of the book, while the second ""on"" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of ""on"" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like ""she is the top expert in her field."" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.<br/><br/>Providing reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding.

Biological systems are very complex, involving a multitude of interactions among many components at different scales.  How ecological communities may be grouped to explain how they coexist and evolve has been a subject of intense interest among biologists and ecologists.  Even after a century of research, the mathematical tools and models needed to fully understand observed species invasions and extinctions do not exist. Moreover, very few ecological studies have considered mathematical models with random effects.  Real world systems are inherently noisy, and only by including random effects can one properly understand an ecological community.

The outcome of the research will be disseminated through seminars, presentations at meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

Of particular interest is the study of primary and secondary extinction cascades in food webs as well as the susceptibility of food webs to invasive species. By considering a variety of empirical and synthetic food webs and incorporating full dynamics with stochasticity, the work will shed light on which ecosystem mechanisms (e.g., self-regulation, interaction strengths, feedback loops) serve to stabilize food webs against perturbations. The three major components of the work are to: (i) perform comprehensive numerical studies of the stochastic systems to improve our understanding of stochastic invasion, primary extinction, and the resulting secondary extinction cascade; (ii) develop new approaches using continuous Markov chain models to find the optimal path to extinction when considering pairwise, three-way, and higher-order interactions between species; and (iii) determine the vulnerability of an existing food web to invasion by exotic species using innovative asymptotic analysis  The results will be useful in improving our understanding of biodiversity and the organization of living communities as well as factors that can stabilize or destabilize ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Separately from photophoresis, thermal absorption and emission in ultrathin structures are important for thermal engineering of miniaturized spacecraft, including interstellar light sails, which may one day transmit images from other stars' planetary systems. The integrated research, education, and outreach plan will train a new generation of engineers to work at the intersection of thermodynamics, heat transfer, and nanotechnology through interdisciplinary courses and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to study radiation absorption, radiation emission, and thermal accommodation in ultrathin metamaterial structures that produce photophoretic forces exceeding their weight. The photophoretic force arises when a solid is illuminated by light, which heats the solid relative to the ambient gas, producing momentum exchange between them. The force is maximized in structures that absorb light on the bottom while keeping the top side cool, or in heated structures with different thermal accommodation coefficients on opposite sides. The PI will use photophoretic levitation as an experimental platform to study light absorption, thermal infrared emission, and thermal accommodation in ultrathin structures, including micro- and nano-patterned structures as well as novel 2D materials. Simultaneously, theoretical modeling will be performed to understand the heat transfer across multiple length scales, including molecular dynamics of thermal accommodation of gas molecules, finite-element simulation of ultrathin selective absorbers and emitters, and analytical modeling of the solid-gas momentum exchange. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the performance of novel experiments and the development of new theoretical models to understand photophoresis and heat transfer in structures with nanoscale thickness but macroscopically large lateral scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systems which are not in equilibrium display phenomena that ""break the rules"" that govern equilibrium phases. Such phenomena are intrinsically interesting and potentially useful for applications. Gases that have been cooled to nano-Kelvin temperatures provide an exciting new platform for the study of non-equilibrium systems. Experiments with ultracold gases flexibly manipulate and image matter using unique and precise tools provided by optics. While such experiments are rapidly advancing, new theoretical techniques are also needed to aid the investigations.  This project will develop numerical algorithms to solve a range of previously intractable, experimentally important problems. The new algorithms will be used to design experimental schemes to cool ultracold matter to even lower temperatures (a grand challenge of the field), thereby redefining the low-temperature frontier. This would realize long-sought and previously inaccessible phases of matter, including phases which simulate high-temperature superconductivity. The project will train graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the use of the new algorithms, facilitating their future use in other areas of non-equilibrium physics. In addition, publicly accessible educational materials will be developed which unify concepts in non-equilibrium dynamics that are used regularly by physicists, but which are taught only inexplicitly, if at all, in typical physics curricula. These lessons will include videos, reading, and exercises that can be used for self-study or in a classroom, and will include multiple versions, each designed for students of different levels of expertise, from non-physicists to practicing researchers.<br/><br/>This project will develop two algorithms, a dynamical numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE) and a cluster truncated Wigner approximation (cl-TWA), which potentially can accurately calculate important ultracold dynamics in minutes on a laptop for cases that are currently inaccessible to even the largest supercomputers. The algorithms achieve their accuracy by recognizing and exploiting special physical structures that underlie many ultracold dynamics experiments. The project will focus on applying these new algorithms to design and optimize new protocols for cooling ultracold matter that fall into three categories: entropy management, adiabatic preparation, and engineered dissipation. It will also partner with experiments to address fundamental questions of nonequilibrium physics, selected to align the strengths of the algorithms with emerging experimental directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, they often exhibit different functional properties and abilities through the thickness of the cell - something that is called planar cellular polarity (PCP). The biofabrication of fully functional epithelial tissues has a broad application in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. One of the main obstacles for achieving this goal is that epithelial cells grown in culture dishes typically do not demonstrate this polarity. The epithelial cell polarity within a sheet or plane of cells is tightly regulated by signaling within and between cells. This signaling does not appear to be maintained in cultured cells and, as a result, reestablishing PCP in manufactured tissues has never been achieved. In addition, some congenital abnormalities, such as spina bifida, are due to the failure of epithelial cells to function properly during embryonic development. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will study the mechanical and biochemical regulatory mechanisms of planar cell polarity in vitro. The project will systematically study the effects of geometrical confinement, matrix stiffness, mechanical strains, and chemical gradients on the initiation and maintenance of PCP, as well as identify the molecules that relay external mechanical signals to the cells for establishing PCP. The educational activities in this project will provide hands-on, project-based experience to a broad audience, with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in a project-based course in mechanobiology. In addition, a summer program that provides computational scientists and biologists with training in advanced bioengineering tools that are developed through this project will facilitate interdisciplinary communication. By improving understanding of how endothelial cells establish this necessary functional variation, this project will support the development of biomanufacturing and tissue engineering systems to produce layers of epithelial cells that are necessary for normal organ function. In addition, the fundamental knowledge gained will advance understanding with respect to normal and pathological tissue growth and development. <br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to expand knowledge about the fundamental mechanisms through which epithelial cells, which are planar polarized, mediate strain-based signaling. This project is focused on neuroepithelial cells that are responsible for the formation of the neural tube during embryonic development, disruption of which can result in neural tube defects (such as spina bifida). This will be accomplished through three research objectives. The first is to investigate the effects of interfacial geometry and matrix stiffness on the asymmetrical distribution of PCP signaling complexes at the single cell level. This objective will use novel patterning techniques to control the areas in which the cells can grow as well as tunable hydrogels to simulate variations in extracellular matrix stiffness. The second objective is to elucidate the role of strains and the Wnt gradient (a set of signal transduction pathways in which proteins pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors) in the alignment of PCP at the tissue level. This alignment will be evaluated at the molecular, cellular, and tissue-level through molecular assays, live-cell imaging, and tissue phenotype assessment. The final objective is to identify the mechanosensors that relay mechanical signals to the PCP pathway. This will be done through selective knock-down of various key mechanoreceptors in the cultured cells to determine how these changes affect strain-mediated alignment of PCP. The knowledge gained from these experiments will advance fundamental understanding of the development of planar cell polarity in neuroepithelial cells and will be more broadly applicable to epithelial cells in general. In addition to answering fundamental questions that are key to tissue growth and development, this research will support the advancement of biomanufacturing and tissue engineering systems that include layers of epithelial cells, which are important for normal tissue function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such polymer materials show promise as membranes for use in innovative technologies, for example, light-weight clean energy generation and storage, water purification, and biomedical applications. However, scientists cannot yet control the structures these polymers form during their processing into membranes. This presents a significant roadblock since these structures determine the properties of the polymer films, and hence control their potential use for devices.  The membrane structure is governed by interactions among the polymer blocks and between each of the blocks with the solvent, as well as processing conditions. The barrier to controlling the structure stems from the tendency of the ionic segments to aggregate and form regions that remain trapped and ""lock"" the polymers during membrane formation.  Using computational tools supported by experimental studies, the project will determine the structure evolution of ionic co-polymers in elongational flow and as the solvents evaporate. The working hypothesis is that ""unlocking"" the ionic clusters without ""locking"" the rest of the blocks, through solvent tuning under flow, will enable the formation of controlled, well-defined structured membranes of ionic co-polymers. With advanced computational tools, coupled with structure determination techniques, the project will provide fundamental insights into polymer processing. This knowledge will directly promote the progress of science and technologies that will advance the economic health and prosperity of the nation.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>With the grand challenge of understanding ionic polymers under dynamic conditions, the research will strive to capture the time evolution of the structure of ionic block co-polymers in solutions in elongational flow and as solvents evaporate. The study will capture polymer processing fundamentals, using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, supported by selective neutron studies. The working hypothesis of the proposed research is that ""unlocking"" the ionic clusters without ""locking"" the hydrophobic blocks will enable the formation of controlled well-defined structures in ionic copolymer membranes. This process is achievable by manipulating a solvent-flow manifold that will control the structure of ionic copolymers and consequently their properties.  A set of well-defined diblocks and triblocks that contain polystyrene sulfonate ionizable blocks, in solutions of selective solvents for each of the blocks and theta-solvents for all blocks, will be studied in elongational flow and as the solvents evaporate. The study will resolve the parameters that lead to the ""unlocked-unlocked"" state for all blocks under dynamic conditions, and its effect on the overall structure of the neat ionizable phases. Understanding the delicate balance of several highly incompatible blocks and their interactions with solvents under quiescent conditions and under flow fields presents experimental and computational challenges. However, the convergence of computational studies and experimental efforts following the structure evolution of ionic co-polymers solvent-flow response will provide the required multi-time-length-scale insight essential to drive the structure of ionizable copolymers.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An integrated device platform will be developed to support data input from multiple devices such as smart phones, wearables, and laptops. An iterative, user-centered design methodology will be applied.

The REE composition of minerals is also used in geosciences to trace geological processes in the Earth's crust. Ore deposits commonly form at depth through the mobilization of metals in aqueous fluids and the mineralization in hydrothermal veins. The properties of both, the fluid and the minerals, will affect how the different REE are fractionated. Currently, we have much to discover about how to quantify systematically the trace element signatures of minerals with regards to fluid-rock interaction and ore-forming processes. This CAREER proposal explores how REE fractionate between aqueous fluids and minerals in ore deposits using laboratory experiments, numerical modeling and fluid inclusions trapped in natural minerals. The THERMO fluids project will be initiated with the preparation of a Fluids & Minerals summer school for undergraduate students, an open access booklet, and a dedicated hands-on thermodynamics tutorial webpage. A major aim of this project will be to provide an education platform and demonstrate the broader significance of thermodynamics in geosciences.<br/><br/>	Calcite, fluorite and apatite are common gangue minerals associated to REE and other mineral deposits. These minerals record geochemical signatures that may be used to determine temperature, fluid chemistry and potentially fluid pathways associated to ore-forming processes. This research involves a comprehensive series of hydrothermal experiments at 100 to 350 degrees C for determining the partitioning of REE between aqueous fluid-calcite, -apatite and -fluorite as a function of temperature and fluid composition (i.e., salinity, pH and ligand activity). The experimental data will be used to develop a new thermodynamic model for predicting and quantifying REE signatures in these hydrothermal minerals. To test the model, a set of mineral trace element compositions and fluid inclusions will be studied in peralkaline, carbonatite, and iron oxide-apatite hosted ore deposits in North America.

Nature uses membranes to encapsulate biological cells. Understanding the process in nature and then building vesicles that mimic cell membranes is useful. The vesicles can, for example, be used as microscale chemical reactors or as vehicles for encapsulating and controllably releasing therapeutic drugs. The principal investigator (PI) and his students will investigate the effects of physical parameters such as the temperature, the ionic strength of the solution, and the charge density of the phospholipids on vesicle formation. The research team will study the encapsulation of ionic cargo into the vesicles under differing physical conditions. Experimental data that is gathered will be used to build and test analytical and numerical models to better understand the process of formation of vesicles and the process of encapsulating cargo.  The award will also support the PI's efforts to enhance the undergraduate and graduate Bioengineering curricula by designing new hands-on laboratory courses. The PI will create a customizable experimental toolkit, the ""SynCell Toolkit"", that will be implemented in K-12 classrooms to increase interest in biomaterials research. The award will provide opportunities for research experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in a diverse multidisciplinary environment in the relatively under-served region of Central California.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Giant vesicles are in vitro constructs that mimic the minimal configuration of biological cells. There is still a lack of a general understanding of the process of vesiculation that leads to giant vesicle formation from surface-supported smectic phospholipid films.  This CAREER award will support an integrated research, education, and outreach plan to obtain new knowledge and fundamental insights into the basic process of giant vesicle formation and the encapsulation of solutes in vesicles. A key distinguishing approach of this proposal is the PI's use of a continuum approximation to analyze the evolution of a population of vesicles rather than focusing on analyzing the growth of isolated vesicles. This approach is enabled by two key discoveries in the PI's lab: (1) The discovery of a cellulose-based method for forming giant vesicles, (2) A stopped-growth method for large-scale analysis of images that can characterize the entire population of vesicles from a sample.  The PI will achieve his integrated research and educational goals by using a combination of experiments, and analytical and numerical modeling. Research aims include: (1) Understanding the dynamics of vesiculation by studying whole populations of giant vesicles produced on cellulose paper. (2) Deciphering the intermolecular and/or intersurface forces that govern vesiculation by controlled perturbation of double-layer electrostatic forces and membrane undulation forces. (3) Understanding the process of encapsulation of ionic solutes during vesiculation by temporally decoupling the process of growth from the process of loading cargo. The educational and outreach components include: (1) Incorporating laboratory components and new courses designed to foster a mode of inquiry-based learning to the Bioengineering curricula. (2) Developing a customizable ""SynCell Toolkit"", that will be implemented in K-12 classrooms to encourage K-12 students to pursue careers in STEM.

Such advances also elevate the concerns that the release of ionic liquids into the environment from wastewater discharges, accidental spillage or a chemical plant accident, is likely to lead to aquatic and groundwater contamination due to their water solubility and limited biodegradability. The proposed research aims to generate foundational knowledge and computational methodologies that can be extended to enzyme engineering for ionic liquid biodegradation. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to unravel the thermodynamics and kinetics of the bacterial cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation, the first step in the biodegradation, of imidazolium-based ionic liquids. The knowledge will then be utilized to rationally design the P450 BM3 enzyme to activate or accelerate the hydroxylation step. The research is guided by the hypothesis that the molecular level understanding of the intermediate steps leading to ionic liquid hydroxylation can be leveraged to identify amino acid residues in the enzyme binding pocket and the substrate access channel that present a thermodynamic and/or kinetic barrier to the reaction. The hypothesis will be tested by (i) characterizing the thermodynamics of the catalytic cycle of ionic liquid hydroxylation; (ii) determining kinetic aspects of the catalytic cycle of ionic liquid hydroxylation, and (iii) evaluating the influence of in silico modification of the key P450 catalytic center residues on the thermodynamics and kinetics of ionic liquid hydroxylation. Free energy-based molecular dynamics simulations will be employed to determine the thermodynamic driving force for ionic liquid binding and product release from the catalytic center.

This is particularly important for engines, such as the aeroturbines found on jets, or the gas turbines found throughout power plants. One challenge facing design engineers working on these engines is that they must design a structure that has to operate at temperatures often in excess of 1400 degree Celsius. Temperatures this high significantly change the way in which components perform; however, very little knowledge exists for how the specific fatigue (i.e. damage) mechanisms in these components evolve with temperature. This project focuses on fundamental research that can lead to the needed knowledge for improving the design process of these structures. The new knowledge will enable engineers to design more efficient structures that don't need frequent maintenance and will provide computational tools to predict the performance of a structure over its entire life cycle.

A second objective is to apply the complex step theorem and the field of generalized complex number theory to create a new method for parameterizing nonlinear structural dynamics models as functions of temperature. To accomplish these objectives, both experimentation and theoretical advancement will be pursued. Experiments will focus on discovering how nonlinearities in structures evolve as a function of temperature, and how multiple nonlinearities interact (e.g. a rocket panel that has geometric nonlinearities due to in-plane stretching and interfacial nonlinearities due to bolted joints). In parallel, a new, parameterized reduced order model will be proposed that expresses the numerical model of a system in terms of temperature and will be validated by the experiments. This modeling framework is based on an extension of the complex step theorem to evaluate sensitivities of a system with respect to a specified variable through the introduction of generalized complex numbers in the system?s definition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How relaxed am I right now? Will I feel better or worse tomorrow?""  These questions are increasingly answerable with personal data collected through fitness trackers and other sensors. Many of the tools that enable this kind of self knowledge rely on visualizations of the data to help users make sense of it. Choices made in the design of these visualizations typically focus on how data are displayed, which data are given priority, and how different types of data will be compared. All of these decisions impact how self-knowledge is created and supported by personal data tools. For populations with complex social identities (such as people experiencing serious mental illness or members of marginalized communities), visual conventions applied to personal data often carry problematic assumptions regarding what is ""normal"" and what ""progress"" looks like.  For example, common data science techniques for visually representing data such as statistical smoothing, normative baselines, and continuous temporal models often do not match well with the lived day-to-day experiences of people with mood or cognitive disorders who self-track as a form of therapy. This project will develop design methods and recommendations for personal data visualizations that better match unique needs of people's identities.  The work will also result in non-discriminatory data visualization practices, teaching materials, and professional resources for more reflective approaches to the design of personal data visualizations. <br/><br/>This research and related educational activities will focus on the visual encoding of personal data for populations particularly vulnerable to discriminatory and biased technology. Empirical design research will engage two vulnerable groups: 1) transgender and gender nonconforming young adults, who are at risk for mental illness and whose identities often badly match common gender assumptions in personal informatics systems and 2) autistic young adults, for whom social activities and visualizations may be quite different from neurotypical individuals. A series of grounded design inquiries will provide HCI, visualization, and data science communities with: 1) evidence of how non-expert data practices are formed through interacting with visualizations; 2) participatory design activities and collaborative visual elicitation protocols; 3) analysis of opportunities, impacts, and implications of non-discriminatory visual encodings of personal data; and 4) development and assessment of medium-fidelity prototypes for personal informatics systems for vulnerable populations. Educational activities will train data science students in human-centered design methods to provide future data scientists with tools to mitigate discriminatory design practices as they enter the workforce.

So far, adaptive user interfaces have mainly been explored for on-screen user interfaces, such as webpages and other digital applications running on desktop computers, laptops, and mobile phones. However, with computing moving into our environment and the increased availability of ""smart"" everyday objects with integrated sensing, it now becomes feasible to ask how the approach deployed for digital adaptive user interfaces can be applied to physical user interfaces, i.e. the physical objects we use in our everyday lives. For instance, consider the example of a child learning how to ride a bike with the help of training wheels: sensors integrated in the wheels can measure how well the child is balancing and determine the current learning progress, then motors can lift or lower the training wheels to increase or decrease the difficulty level according to the child's progress. The research team will study a range of application use cases in the areas of learning (e.g., adaptive writing aids, adaptive toys for child development), health and rehabilitation (e.g., adaptive walkers, canes, casts), and accessibility (e.g., adaptive tools for meal preparation, personal care, and recreation).   <br/><br/>The investigator will follow the research plan that was initially deployed for influential early work on digital adaptive user interfaces.

Using the insights gained from this investigation, the team will build a framework of design principles for building adaptive physical tools and propose a set of metrics for measuring their successful application. The framework will cover aspects, such as the adaptation time during interaction (i.e., the time for the tool to change its physical state), the adaptation range (i.e., the range actuators have to cover when changing the physical tool), and the adaptation integration (i.e., adding sensors and actuators in a way that does not interfere with the user interaction). Based on the framework of design principles, the team will develop a design tool that facilitates the development of adaptive physical tools.

This family of materials consists of few-atom-thick crystals, which are particularly attractive due to their highly anisotropic properties and the capability to stack them without restrictions found in bulk systems.  The strength of the interlayer coupling in these systems is comparable to energy scales induced through external electric, magnetic, and mechanical fields.  So, these complex heterostructures offer the possibility of unprecedented modulation of the interlayer coupling with consequences for their properties.  Theoretical descriptions of these interactions have so far relied on phenomenological lumped models that do not include atomistic details or quantum mechanical effects which makes it challenging to identify underlying principles and devise mechanisms to control their functionalities.  Elucidating the interplay among weak interactions, structure, and function in these heterostructures is key to fully exploit their potential and expand the repertoire of functional materials and a goal of this project.<br/><br/>   The research will combine theoretical models, first principles calculations, and large-scale computation to describe the weak interactions in heterostructures based on two-dimensional materials including atomistic details and quantum mechanical effects.  First, the PI and his team will investigate modulation of the interlayer coupling via external electric, magnetic, and mechanical fields in two-dimensional materials and their alloys.  Next, the PI will use state-of-the-art high-throughput computations to enable a data-driven search of heterostructures formed with different two-dimensional materials that exhibit enhanced properties of particular interest. The result will serve as a guide to experimental design. This integrated theoretical-computational approach to the characterization of complex heterostructures may translate into the discovery of novel physical phenomena. In addition, it may help to accelerate the deployment of functional high-performance materials and energy-efficient device structures that can revolutionize electronic device and sensor technologies.<br/><br/>    This research will be coupled to education and outreach activities to be carried out at Auburn University and in the Southeastern US region.

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is based on the premise that intelligent surgical robotics can elevate skilled performance of precision manual tasks by melding the high-level planning and adaptability of the human surgeon with the superhuman speed and precision of a hand-held robotic tool. The specific application to be studied and modeled is 3D printing of biologically-compatible materials directly onto moving human anatomy using hand-held, robotic, bio-jet technology.  This is an example of a new convergent discipline, which the PI calls ""computational co-surgery."" Here, the handheld robot shares control of the bio-jet with the surgeon. Realizing the full potential of the human / robot dyad will require seamless cooperation and a dynamic tradeoff between speed and accuracy to deal with unpredictable target motions. This in turn requires the human surgeon to monitor and evaluate the quality and intent of the robot's motions as they unfold at high speed. The project will quantify the ability of humans to perceive and characterize visual feedback of tool motion at high speeds using a novel crowd-sourcing approach. Seamless cooperation also requires that the surgeon exert high-bandwidth control over the hand-held device. The proposal will explore the extent to which voluntary modulation of limb reflex responses can facilitate low-latency monitoring and control operations. The project also includes several annual outreach events where participants use handheld robots to discover and learn about computational co-surgery and human-robot shared control.  As such, this CAREER project promotes the progress of science, advances the national health, and contributes to the development of the STEM workforce, with efforts to attract students from underrepresented minority populations. <br/><br/>The PI will advance a new interdisciplinary field of study termed ""computational co-surgery"" through a project that will ultimately enable 3D printing of bio-materials directly onto moving human anatomy using hand-held, robotic technology.  The project combines elements of psychology (visual perception), engineering (robotic design and control), and physiology (sensorimotor control) to promote the ability of the human surgeon to leverage the speed and precision of a hand-held robotic tool. In the case to be studied, an intelligent robot and a human surgeon share control of a surgical instrument, with touch and proprioception as the feedback channels and limb stiffness modulation as the actuation method. The research objective is to measure how humans perceive (Aim 1) and interact with (Aim 2) objects that move with high speed (<1kHz bandwidth) and precision (~50 um).  Aim 1 will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to test the working hypothesis that when viewing tool manipulations, assessments of skill reflect a trade-off between movement speed and movement quality (precision) subject to psychological factors including internal models of limb and object dynamics, and stimulus coherence in multisensory integration.  Further, the project will explore the utility of touch and proprioception (feedback) and limb stiffness modulation (actuation) to realize low-latency, non-invasive bidirectional human-robot monitoring and control. Aim 2 will use a customized hand-held robot with high- and low-inertia modes and a Fitts pointing task to test the working hypotheses that: 1) limb stiffness modulation is a fast and effective means of quickly ceding control between robot and human intent during manipulations requiring high speed and precision; and 2) humans naturally modulate effective stiffness at the hand-robot interface via long-latency reflex action (i.e., without lengthy training).  Accomplishing these Aims will advance the fundamental science of handheld collaborative robots that cope with unpredictable human motion or human intent. The educational goal includes an outreach plan where participants are invited to use a small hand-held robot to see if they can ""perform better than the best surgeon"" in mock surgical tasks.  Sites span classroom settings, public events, and international acconferences attended by clinicians and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, trillions of cells interact both physically and chemically to form highly complex biological organisms.  These organisms are then capable of behaviors infinitely more diverse than those of the individual cells.  When many simple parts give rise to complex behaviors, the term often used is ""emergent.""  Self-propelled particles (SPP's) are entities capable of moving without the influence of external factors.  The behavior of a collection of these SPP's can lead to emergent phenomena similar to the complex formations observed in herds of migrating animals.  In general, it is difficult to predict what properties will emerge when the only information available is how the SPP's move and interact with each other. Thus, being able to perform controlled experiments on interacting SPP's is expected to help bridge this gap, but very few systems of this type are currently available. This project is dedicated to developing a system of small-scale SPP's that show emergent phenomena that are dependent upon the details of how fast the particles move, and more importantly, how they interact; both parameters can be tuned, even in real time.  Another key feature of this novel system is the particles do not come into direct contact with others, mimicking behaviors such as swarming and flocking as seen in nature. These contactless particle swarms allow the study of new phenomena and make possible novel nano- and microscale material fabrication. This project will have far reaching impact on undergraduate research opportunities at Northern Arizona University (NAU).  It will also impact the graduate program in Applied Physics at NAU, with a new class being developed aimed at introducing the students to the everyday activities of a professional scientist. Impact upon the local community will include the researchers working closely with a middle school on a project related to active matter as well as outreach to Native American students at the Hopi High School.<br/><br/>Active matter consists of driven mobile entities that move and interact to form dynamic structures and patterns with properties not seen at the level of the individual self-propelled particles (SPP's). Several recent studies have been concerned with the collective and emergent phenomena observed in active colloidal matter, but the proposed research herein is unique in that the particles form clusters that do not come into direct contact, overcoming numerous current experimental limitations in this field and allowing for testing current theoretical predictions. The system, in particular, combines controllable activity using an external light source and tunable ""contactless"" long-range interactions arising from magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between the particles. Depending upon the geometry, these interactions can take on different forms that can be attractive, repulsive, or a combination of these. Interactions between large numbers of contactless SPP's results in collective motion that has not been demonstrated in the past and changes with particle type. Moreover, the system is ideal for the exploration of new phenomena such as shape-dependent collective behavior of complex 3D colloids when steric interactions are absent. This unique system not only allows for engineering new forms of controlled particle-particle interactions and multiple-particle collective phenomena, but these behaviors can be harnessed to fabricate new materials by active self-assembly. As many of the experimental techniques and methods in this project are excellent for introducing students to research for the first time, not only will undergraduates be an integral part of this work, but the researchers involved in this project will also work closely with STEM City to make bi-yearly visits to a middle school in Flagstaff, where the students will have the opportunity to take part in a research project on active matter. Additional efforts to disseminate this research beyond the University include outreach to K-12 students, and the larger public, in the local Flagstaff, AZ community via the Flagstaff Festival of Science and beyond by making yearly visits to the Hopi Native American Reservation for hands-on demonstrations with high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This function is commonly referred to as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and may become compromised in various brain diseases, but the reason for this change is often unclear.  The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to investigate the hypothesis that changes in the stiffness of the extracellular matrix of blood vessels are one of the causes of dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier.  This research will be accomplished by conducting measurements directly on blood vessels dissected from mouse and human brain tissue as well as by building blood vessel models from human stem cells through which the matrix stiffness and other parameters can be precisely controlled.  These results will provide key insight into fundamental processes related to the progression of changes in brain vascular physiology due to aging or disease.  In conjunction with this research plan, new educational and outreach activities will be developed and disseminated.  In collaboration with a local artist and high school students who will perform research in the PI?s lab, a series of educational materials will be developed to explain how stem cells can be used for understanding and treating diseases. These materials will be disseminated at a Nashville science outreach center, through after-school clubs for economically disadvantaged students, and a yearly neuroscience event, thus promoting learning and engagement in the local community.   <br/><br/>The overall research goal of this award is to understand the mechanobiology of the blood-brain barrier, specifically related to the interaction of the cerebrovascular mechanics with BBB function.  This will be accomplished through two primary research objectives.  The first objective is to fundamentally characterize how neurovascular tissue stiffness influences blood-brain barrier function in situ (in natural tissue) and in vitro (in engineered tissue).  The in situ portion of the project will characterize the neurovascular stiffness, blood-brain barrier leakage, and extracellular matrix remodeling as a function of age and disease using mouse and human brain tissue samples.  The in vitro portion of the work will develop blood-brain barrier mimics using induced pluripotent stem cells that can model this structure.  These mimics will then be used to directly examine the effect of substrate stiffness on blood-brain barrier function.  The second objective is to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms, specifically the mechanical triggers and the molecular signals, that regulate neurovascular stiffening in 2D and 3D culture.  The focus will be on both autonomous and cross-talk signaling for the various cells that make up the blood-brain barrier.  Understanding more fully the blood-brain barrier -- and in particular how changes in vascular stiffness that occur during aging and other pathologies may impact its function -- is a key area for understanding cerebrovascular physiology and how materials can be transported (or prevented from being transported) to the brain tissue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ideal window should seasonally respond to the solar heat, while transmitting the visible light. However, current window technologies are challenged to modulate solar heat independent of visible light. Recent advances in nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to independently manipulate NIR light. This project will integrate the nanoscale physical relations and effects of nanomaterials on the thermal and optical behaviors of multi-layer glazing structures. The societal impacts of the project will constitute a new class of building windows that can greatly reduce the total building energy consumption in the nation. The educational impacts will include courses concentrating on building windows and envelopes, which bridge the knowledge and ignite collaborative interest between the architecture and engineering communities for cultivating future professionals in the sustainable building industry. Furthermore, experimental modules will be created to teach high school students to build their own sensors for window measurements and to raise community and public awareness of energy-efficient window technology.<br/><br/>To achieve the objective, the research approach includes: (1) decomposing global solar irradiance into its spectral band components to achieve a time-dependent NIR model; (2) deriving and experimentally validating the fundamental thermal and optical behaviors of NIR-selective glazing structures; and (3) integrating the thermo-optical model and NIR model for the evaluation and optimization of dynamic NIR-selective glazing structures. This research will form the foundation to understand the combined effects of nanoscale phenomenon (i.e., photoexcitation) and micro-to-macroscale glazing structure properties (i.e., glazing properties, spectral emissivity, central-layer insulating abilities, layer placements). Such knowledge will significantly improve our ability to incorporate NIR-selective materials into building windows. New analytical models that take the nanoscale NIR absorption and scattering features into account will be developed and experimentally validated. By coupling the developed solar spectral decomposition model and computational method to quantify glazing performance, this research will provide an understanding of the salient characteristics and patterns of the optimal time-dependent thermo-optical properties of NIR-selective glazing structures to achieve a minimum level of energy use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellular structures are important in many applications, including light-weight aerospace structures, biomedical devices, energy absorbers, heat exchangers, and acoustic insulation. However, general techniques for optimally designing cellular structures remain a challenge. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to create new techniques for optimally designing cellular structures to achieve unrivaled performance for specific engineering applications. The design approach will permit cellular shape and size to vary optimally throughout the structure and will incorporate manufacturing constraints associated with 3D printing techniques in the optimization process. Two applications are identified to evaluate the methodology and demonstrate its benefit to society: improved orthopedic implants and lightweight aircraft wing structures for improved energy efficiency. This CAREER project will integrate cellular structure design and fabrication concepts into interactive learning plans through hands-on demonstrations, visual tools, concept-mapping, and a cellular design computer app. Aimed at audiences from K-12 to the general public, with specific emphasis on diverse underrepresented groups, the educational plan consists of four components: (1) educator training, (2) student extracurricular activities, (3) curriculum development, and (4) public outreach.<br/><br/>The theoretical and experimental foundations of this CAREER award will allow a shift from optimizing the topology of macrostructures to topology and morphology of cellular microstructures expanding design flexibility without placing excessive demands on computational resources.

Innovative aspects of the research include utilizing a harmonics decomposition that is adaptable to different cell types to represent the cellular configurations in the optimization process and implementing cell size and length scale constraints in the methodology to ensure fabrication feasibility. The relationships between the optimized cellular geometries and mechanical properties and structural performance are studied through simulation and experimental testing. The optimized microstructures will be 3D printed and various manufacturability characteristics such as deformation and powder trapping will be studied for different cell types and length scales.

With the increasing heterogeneity and complexity observed in cancers, the need for accurate diagnosis and molecular monitoring of disease progression has become more important than ever. Liquid biopsy of microscopic vesicles from our cells circulating in human bodily fluids is a promising, inexpensive, and minimally invasive approach for cancer diagnosis and personalized medical treatment. Particularly, detecting the biomolecules carried by these vesicles, including nucleic acids encoding genetic information, has emerged as a promising strategy for early diagnosis. However, the existing diagnostic tools for such technologies lack the needed sensitivity, specificity, speed, and cost-effectiveness necessary to become clinically viable. This CAREER proposal fully exploits the cutting-edge development in small-scale technologies such as nanophotonics, nanofluidics, and biosensing to provide novel solutions for the detection of diagnostic nucleic acids from clinical samples with an improved sensitivity, reduced sample volume, and decreased analysis time. The success of the proposed technology will have significant impact on early-stage diagnosis as well as prognosis and management of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. By integrating research and education, the project will promote public awareness of the importance of nanobiotechnology in health care, and to cultivate the next-generation of scientists and engineers in nanotechnology and biosensing to address grand challenges in affordable and portable disease diagnosis. Further, this project aims to attract the participation of K-12 students and underrepresented individuals (e.g., female and Native American students) in STEM careers.  <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to validate the hypothesis that an integrated and multiplexed optofluidic platform can accurately detect exosomal miRNAs. In pursuit of this goal, a nanofluidic chip (ExoMiRChip) will be designed to functionally integrate label-free exosome purification, on-chip exosomal miRNA extraction, and plasmonic miRNA sensing. Theories and experiments will be combined to address fundamental challenges in achieving high-resolution and high-throughput exosome nanoparticle sorting, high-sensitivity and high-specificity miRNA detection, and multi-functional integration of nanofluidic systems. This project will explore scientific unknowns in exosome nanoparticle fluidic dynamics at the nanometer scale, and aim to comprehensively elucidate the limiting factors in on-chip exosome purification. The project will innovate optically coupled ultrasensitive plasmonic nanosensors functionalized with sequence-specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes, and use them to identify the critical factors affecting accurate detection of exosomal miRNA, including the plasmonic sensor design, nanostructure fabrication, miRNA molecular concentration, and the miRNA selectivity. Successful nanofluidic integration on the ExoMiRChip will significantly reduce sample volume in diagnosis (from milliliters to microliters), minimize bias and contamination, improve diagnosis speed (estimated from days/weeks to hours), and potentially enable multiplexed biomarker detection.

Since most mathematical objects can be represented as a structure, its subject matter is very broad and it interacts with several areas of mathematics. However, whereas other fields of mathematics are interested in specific structures, or classes of structures (for instance arithmetic studies the structure of the integers with addition and multiplication), model theory takes a step back and studies structures in general, looking for dividing lines and common properties. It singles out large classes of structures defined by combinatorial tameness conditions (which imply that the structure is in some sense not too complicated) and then attempts to understand the structures in those classes. One such class is that of NIP structures, which can be thought of as structures that have a geometric flavor. This class has received a lot of attention in the past decade. Another class is that of homogeneous structures, which are structures that have a lot of symmetries. Those are objects that belong to combinatorics and have been largely studied outside, or at the border of model theory. The main goal of this project is the investigation of new model-theoretic tools to understand homogeneous structures and in particular those that are NIP. There are few general theorems on homogeneous structures and at the same time no evidence that there cannot be any: we do not know how complicated homogeneous structures can be and this project hopes to shed light on this.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project is the classification of the primitive rank 1 NIP homogeneous structures obtained by the PI. One goal is naturally to generalize this result to all finite rank NIP homogeneous structures. A more long-term goal is the classification of all NIP homogeneous structures. This would require understanding omega-categorical linear orders, which is an interesting project in its own right. A more general goal of the project is the development of model-theoretic tools to study homogeneous structures. This will build on the work mentioned above as well as on a previous work with Itay Kaplan on finitely generated dense subgroups of automorphism groups. Projects include finding model-theoretic consequences of the Ramsey property and clarifying its link with distality, finding necessary and sufficient conditions for admitting homogeneous expansions with nice properties (including having a stationary or canonical independence relation, being linearly ordered, Ramsey etc.). Finally, a more speculative project is the understanding of random-like behaviors in homogeneous structures and finding ways to measure the complexity of homogeneous structures, in particular those that lie outside the usual model-theoretic tame classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional ways of programming conflate algorithms and their organization such that a straightforward implementation is unacceptably slow. At the same time, neither one can be written or optimized independently, which limits the productivity of programmers and the portability of programs to future hardware. Optimized organizations are often an order of magnitude faster and more complex since they necessarily take a global, rather than per-operation, view of the algorithm to exploit parallelism and locality. This project's novelty is in creating a new kind of programming language in which the algorithm and its organization are decoupled from one another. Programming systems are the tool through which computation is applied to human problems. The project's impact will be transforming the way major classes of software are written, enabling a wider range of people to more productively write new algorithms which are both high-performance and portable to future computing hardware.<br/> <br/>This project explores a programming model that decouples algorithms from their organization, represented explicitly in the language as a ""schedule."" It extends this paradigm from multidimensional arrays to more general computations and data structures, including sparse matrices and graphs, and builds a machine-learning system to automatically find schedules competitive with human experts. To realize this vision, it pursues four major research directions: (a) combining tree search with neural networks in a reinforcement learning system to automatically find expert-quality schedules; (b) broadening the class of expressible computations and schedules to include general loops and program gradients; (c) broadening the class of data structures and schedules with a relational model to process sparse and linked data; and (d) creating a comprehensive performance benchmark suite to serve as our evaluation testbed, and also be shared broadly to foster new research in systems, compilers, and architecture. The resulting language and compiler enables productive high-performance programming and provides a powerful foundation for easily building new domain-specific programming systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has led to widespread contamination of water supplies. Several contaminants cannot be removed using common water-treatment technologies, potentially impacting human health. To address this problem, the investigator will develop a highly innovative water treatment system that uses nanotechnology-based catalysts. These catalysts increase the rate of a chemical reaction to efficiently clean water in a cost-effective way. Results from this research may lead to a transformative technology for low cost water treatment. The researchers will create virtual reality tours of water treatment facilities in college courses that can be accessed by the public to promote a better understanding of how environmental engineers protect human health.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop nano-enabled catalysts to solve fundamental and applied water quality problems. Heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts (HHCs) are a promising treatment option for numerous environmentally-persistent contaminants such as halogenated and oxygenated organic compounds. Recent advancements in nanotechnology make HHCs more feasible as a water treatment technology, with the achievement of higher reaction rates and better reaction selectivity for innocuous by-products. However, challenges remain due to catalyst cost and mass transport limitations. This research will investigate the kinetic mechanisms, stability, and scalability of a new HHC reactor - the catalytic hydrogel membrane (CHM) reactor. The CHM consists of a gas-permeable hollow-fiber membrane coated with hydrogel-containing catalyst nanoparticles. Using a suite of advanced electrochemical and spectroscopy tools, the specific tasks of this research are to: i) quantify bulk reaction and film diffusion rates in model and real water systems; ii) identify the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation; iii) quantify the mechanical properties of the hydrogel support; iv) model the performance of a scaled-up, continuous-flow CHM reactor; and v) investigate the applicability of CHM for emerging drinking water contaminants. Complimentary to these research objectives are the investigator?s educational goals to enhance graduate training through research, improve undergraduate education using virtual reality (VR) modules, increase underrepresented group participation in engineering, and use outreach to excite and educate the public about water quality. To enhance undergraduate education and provide outreach opportunities for all ages, the investigator will develop and use VR tours of water treatment facilities.

Fundamentally new approaches that are designed specifically to address the challenges of limited-resource settings are needed. Utilizing paper as a substrate to develop biosensors is attractive because the resources required to produce them are minimal and the materials are ubiquitous and inexpensive.  This project will create new device designs that can enable paper-based biosensing.  Hydrophilic (wettable) channels will be patterned in paper using hydrophobic (non-wettable) barriers in order to control the transport of sample fluids by wicking.   In addition to devising a new strategy for bioanalysis in limited-resource settings, the broader impacts of this research program include the creation of educational opportunities for middle school students (hands-on workshops), high school students (device design challenges and summer internships), and science teachers (classroom kit development).<br/><br/><br/>Due to their low cost and ease of use, paper-based microfluidic devices have gained attention as a platform to develop point-of-use bioassays. Independent of the advances in assay development, the paper-based devices themselves, in spite of their vast potential to facilitate bioanalysis, have received surprisingly little attention. This project aims to build an integrated research and education program centered on developing novel paper-based microfluidic devices that can facilitate biosensing based on chemical and biochemical reactions that occur at the interfaces formed between converging liquid fronts. Devices exploiting this approach will facilitate multiplexed biosensing using assay formats that are traditionally considered to be incompatible with flow-based devices (e.g., chemical reactions). The central hypothesis of this research is that the material properties of the paper (e.g., porosity) and the transport of reaction products (e.g., by diffusion) will ultimately control the analytical performance of these paper-based biosensors. By studying these variables systematically, new strategies for low-cost, paper-based biosensing will be developed. Assays at fluidic interfaces will result in the formation of visible colors that will allow users to easily interpret the results of an assay via visual threshold (qualitative), visual comparisons of intensities to read guides (semi-quantitative), or with image analysis (quantitative). This research is significant because the devices derived from this program span a broad range of applications in bioanalysis and will serve as versatile tools for all forms of analytical chemistry. Potential applications include: (i) environmental monitoring of heavy metals, (ii) food security and nutrient density, (iii) detection of nucleic acids and proteins, and (iv) the development of diagnostic assays that are designed specifically for use in limited-resource settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Principal Investigator (PI) will study basic mathematical objects by studying their symmetries, and by studying how the objects change under transformations: this is the study of group actions.  The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.  The project also involves the introduction of active-learning courses for undergraduate mathematics students, including a program to train graduate students in teaching methods, and a major workshop on effectively communicating mathematics across research areas with the aim of increasing communication between mathematicians in disparate fields.  <br/><br/><br/>A major guiding principle in the PI's work is that rigidity of group actions, in the sense of topological dynamics, is often the result of an underlying geometric structure.

This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications. The PI will continue work on flat bundles and rigid monodromy group actions, using techniques from foliation theory and coarse geometry in negative curvature to study boundary actions.  Another strand of this project involves an investigation of rigidity of infinite discrete groups acting on the circle through the topology of spaces of circular orders, following work of A. Navas.

The research team is building and analyzing a repository of materials related to PCAST - personal communications and archival collections - and conducting and publishing oral history interviews with PCAST members. This data will be used to develop policy recommendations for future White House STEM advisory bodies, determine best practices, identify areas of improvements, and raise overall awareness of PCAST's role and, more broadly, the role of STEM in developing public policy.

Bush, PCAST advises the president on a broad range of issues related to STEM including national and domestic security, workforce and the economy, energy and the environment, and public health and medicine. The council, with its high-profile membership and proximity to the president, has historically played a central role in shaping federal STEM policy and maintaining the overall health of the nation's STEM enterprise.

High-speed switching operation generates electromagnetic noise interference (EMI) problems in power electronic systems, which can cause system failure and malfunction. Furthermore, no product can be sold unless passing standard EMI qualifications. EMI issues are considered to have high complexity and nonlinearity, with passive EMI filters being the dominating solution to mitigate this problem. These passive filters tend to be bulky, lossy, costly, sensitive to circuit parasitics, and requiring ?error-and-try? design iterations to achieve satisfactory filter performance. Moreover, EMI problem becomes even more serious with the emergence of wide bandgap (WBG) devices as these new devices have much higher di/dt and dv/dt than silicon devices, so traditional passive filters turn out to affect adversely the power density for modern power electronic converters. This proposed project provides a disruptive semiconductor-based active filtering method which could essentially replace passive filtering solutions that have been used for decades. The success of this project will not only significantly improve the power density and efficiency of future power electronic systems, but also changes the design philosophy for EMI mitigation in such systems. The proposed program integrates cutting-edge research with education, and thus, providing a platform to integrate STEM interdisciplinary knowledge together with hands-on activities with the focus on establishing a pipeline of STEM students in electrical engineering from pre-college to graduate level. With the support of the College of Engineering Career Awareness Program (ECAP) at the University of Arkansas, this project will also foster women and underrepresented students participation in this STEM field. Therefore, this program will enhance the infrastructure for next-generation multidisciplinary diversified STEM education aimed at supporting power engineering workforce development. <br/><br/>Targeting the fundamental EMI problem in modern WBG electronics conversion, the research objectives of this project are to: (1) establish a new semiconductor-based electromagnetic noise mitigation architecture replacing existing passive-dominated filtering systems and achieving very-high power densities, (2) create and demonstrate a family of semiconductor-based filtering solutions suitable for different applications, (3) investigate the so-called high-frequency-EMI-model-based, real-time, noise compensation framework as a more general plug-&-play EMI solution, and (4) develop a guideline for high-density EMI filter integration.  This proposed semiconductor-based EMI mitigation architecture uses active components to ?eliminate? EMI noises at real time, and thus, it can be self-commissioned in various applications. This proposed research is transformative in the sense that it opens a new area of traditional research. The research activity will advance the knowledge of this nonlinear problem not only in the existing power conversion framework, but also across other electrical engineering subfields as well as physics domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important feature of the dynamics of diseases transmitted on contact is that the contact patterns change in response to infection and progression of symptoms: infected individuals curtail contacts with their regular community due to illness (e.g. being too sick to go to school or work) but increase their contacts with other segments of the population, such as healthcare workers or caretakers in the home. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa provides a stark example, but there have been many others, for instance in the waves of HIV-AIDS epidemics in various parts of the world as well as new, smaller outbreaks of Ebola in remote parts of the Congo.  Although the question of how evolving contact network structure and infection status affect disease outbreaks seems basic, theoretical treatments have been very limited. The main objective of this project is to help address this knowledge gap by developing mathematical results and tools for simple approximation of these complicated dynamics.  The research will be of interest to many individuals and organizations inside and outside of academia including the Centers for Disease Control, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health. Training will be provided for a PhD student from the Kinshasa School of Public Health via annual monthly visits to Ohio State University and ongoing international collaboration; a US graduate student will also be trained in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/><br/>This project will develop a general Approximate Markovian Computation (AMC) framework for approximating complex stochastic SIR-type disease models on evolving, large, multi-layer networks in which each layer corresponds to an interaction type (also referred to as multiplex or multi-relational network). The idea of AMC is that for a large random configuration network one may often construct Markov jump process closely tracking the outbreak dynamics on the original network despite averaging out some network features (e.g. number of contacts or drop/activation rates). If both processes share the same mean field limiting equations, they also share the same set of limiting parameters; hence the Markov process may also be used for consistent parameter estimation. On the one hand, AMC bears some conceptual resemblance to the popular ABC method in Bayesian inference, although, unlike ABC, it explicitly approximates the likelihood of the SIR process of interest. On the other hand, AMC may also be viewed as a generalization of quasi-equilibrium approximations for stochastic complex systems. In addition to developing relevant theoretical results, the investigators plan to develop software to apply AMC to real field data from contact epidemics in Africa and elsewhere. It is hoped that methods developed in this project will improve predictive modeling for infectious diseases and provide essential insight into key contact epidemic features such as invasion probability, persistence, and outbreak size.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, the programming of chemicals-automating the processing of information embedded in molecules could remake the world: smart molecules controlled by programmable chemical reactions could achieve the same level of precise automated control over the configuration of matter at the molecular level. This may one day revolutionize, for example, therapeutic treatments applied within living cells or nanoscale materials fabricated by self-assembly. This project aims to develop the mathematical foundations of such chemical information processing, bringing the engineering of chemistry-based ""software"" closer to the reliability of modern electronic computing. Research will be directed toward key challenges that have faced practitioners in the field: namely error-prevention, reusability, and the ability to integrate separately designed chemical systems into a properly functioning whole. Insights gleaned from research in classical computer science will be applied to achieve these goals, but new insights, based on the laws of physics and chemistry, will be required to reason about the uniquely molecular interactions mediating chemical computation. The potential applications in medicine or nano-engineering include identifying and curing diseases, as well as self-assembling devices with nanoscale precision. Together with a tightly integrated educational plan based on training female undergraduate mathematics students in computer science research, and a data-driven approach to develop autograding software for undergraduate CS courses, this project will help train a new and diverse generation of interdisciplinary scientists and programmers, who can innovate robust nanoscale information technologies.<br/><br/>This project advances the theoretical foundation for programming chemical algorithms-that is, algorithms executed by artificially synthesized chemical reactions-ensuring they have three crucial properties that are lacking, or at best poorly understood, in existing systems: (1) error-free: implementable by real chemicals that faithfully execute the intended algorithm, (2) uniform: correct for any ""population size"", i.e., the total number of molecules, unlike many current algorithms where reactions must be tailored specifically to the population size and (3) composable: can be packaged into functional modules that are easily combined. As DNA nanotechnology and molecular computing mature, so too must our insight into their fundamental abilities and limitations. A rigorous theory of chemical computing will guide the experimental breakthroughs of the future. Development of this theory will be guided by a preference for substrate-independence, identifying the laws of computation obeyed by all chemical systems, sifting out artifacts of particular technologies from their shared unifying principles. The development of techniques to make chemical algorithms error-free, uniform, and composable could lead to a systematic path for programming chemistry, making it understandable and usable by non-chemists thus allowing the molecular computing revolution to take flight. Advances in programmable kinetic barriers in implementing an autocatalytic reaction could eventually lead to a significant technological breakthrough allowing error-resilient single-molecule detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many simple randomized algorithms perform better than sophisticated deterministic algorithms, and random bits are widely used in modern cryptography to ensure security. Moreover, in certain applications regarding designing combinatorial objects (such as highly connected sparse networks), simply choosing a random object often achieves the best parameters. However, the use of random bits comes at a price: in practice high quality random bits are often too costly to obtain, and many applications such as the example of designing a sparse network require deterministic constructions rather than randomized ones. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the fundamental question of when and how one can replace the use of random bits or randomized objects by pseudorandom objects, which are objects that are deterministically constructed but behave like random ones. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of random bits in computation, as well as more efficient and secure solutions to important questions both in theory and in practice. Examples of benefits include faster algorithms for handling large data sets, more robust networks, and more reliable communications in hostile environments. The project also involves plans for mentoring PhD students, integration of the research topics into courses and books that appeal to students from a variety of different backgrounds, and support of under-represented groups of students in computer science.<br/><br/>The project contains three sets of specific goals. The first set of goals seeks to understand how to reduce the quantity or quality of random bits in computation generally, using two kinds of  pseudorandom objects known as pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors. A pseudorandom generator is a function that stretches a short random seed into a long string that looks random to certain functions, and it can be used to reduce the quantity of random bits required. A randomness extractor is a function that transforms imperfect random sources into high quality random bits. The second set of goals investigates the connections of these pseudorandom objects to computational complexity theory. Specifically, the goal is to use the random-like property of these objects to give new constructions of deterministic objects that circumvent barriers in long-standing open problems, such as the question of sequential computation versus parallel computation. The third set of goals involves development of new techniques for constructions of error-correcting codes, which can be used both to protect against various tampering attacks from adversaries, and to achieve privacy or security in cryptographic systems. The study of these topics is based on techniques from several related areas such as probability theory, information theory, cryptography, combinatorics, and harmonic analysis, and will further foster the interactions among these areas towards breakthroughs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Secret sharing is a cryptographic primitive that can help to achieve secure communication with applications that include access control, key management, digital signatures, and others. Although this primitive is widely used, it is still not fully understood how wireless communication constraints such as noise, limited bandwidth, and scalability can be optimally accounted for in the design of secret sharing schemes. This project aims for new guidelines for the implementation of secret sharing directly adapted to wireless communication constraints, to improve security for users, minimize the communication cost associated with the implementation, and facilitate deployment in dense wireless networks through improved scalability.<br/><br/>Most existing secret sharing schemes hinge on the assumption that the dealer can securely communicate the shares of the secret to the participants over noiseless channels with unlimited bandwidth. Under such an assumption, the implementation of secret sharing schemes in wireless networks requires additional layers of protocols able to deal with unsecured, noisy, and bandwidth limited communication channels between the dealer and the participants. The objective of this project is to understand whether such a layered approach is optimal and whether a scheme that simultaneously addresses the constraints of wireless communication and the requirements of secret sharing could provide gains in terms of communication efficiency and security guarantees. The project investigates two interdependent research tasks: (i) understanding the fundamental security limits for secret sharing in wireless networks under bandwidth constraints and noise, and (ii) the design of explicit low-complexity coding schemes using tools from cryptography and coding theory.<br/>This award is jointly funded by the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in the Office of Integrative Activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will expose the participants to daily life in graduate school, through interactions with graduate students, graduate advisors, faculty and postdocs in the UCSB math department. In addition, through professional development workshops, the participants will learn about different areas in industry that demand professionals with good research skills. <br/><br/>Historically, the UCSB REU has not focused on a specific area of mathematics. However, the program intends to be accessible to students with a variety of backgrounds in mathematics. Thus, the research projects are likely to be in linear algebra, matrix analysis, numerical linear algebra, combinatorics and graph theory; that is, in areas that do not require extensive mathematical background from students. Examples of topics that have been studied in this program before include 1) primitive circulant matrices; 2) matrix polynomials and linearizations; 3) matrix equations; 4) parking functions; 5) Alexander and Jones polynomials; 6) sequential dynamical systems.  The topics will change every year depending on the active research areas of the mentors involved in the program. The final goal is to expose the students to the techniques and methods used to tackle problems in these areas, to publish papers in refereed professional journals, and to participate and give talks in conferences for undergraduates. The REU concludes with a poster conference in which undergraduates doing summer research in all the UCSB departments present their results and make it accessible to non-experts in the area.

It is difficult to predict how complex microbial communities will behave based on only what species are known to be present, because most prevalent microbes often change over time and from location to location, even as the community behavior stays the same. This work will develop a quantitative standard to describe the state of the microbial community for assessing bioreactor system performance. The research team will also create environmental engineering focused cartoons as part of an outreach effort. The cartoons will target underrepresented preteens and teens to increase scientific literacy and expand future participation in environmental engineering.<br/><br/>The overall research objective of this research is to apply the theoretical ecology principles to quantify the fundamental processes that drive microbial community architecture, functionality, and fluidity. The system of interest in this work will be anaerobic digesters during periods of stability, upset, and recovery. This research will test the hypothesis that strategic changes to the operational parameters of biotreatment systems can shape their microbial communities into predictable compositions that achieve the desired functional improvement. Three research objectives will be used to test this hypothesis. First, the dynamic microbiome structures and individual microbial interactions that occur in full-scale anaerobic bioreactors operated under non-co-digesting and co-digesting conditions will be quantified utilizing sequence data collected from full-scale facilities bi-monthly over a two-year period. Normal operational range benchmarks (NORBs) will be created to identify the natural variability that would be expected under stable operating conditions. Second, the NORBs for operational parameters including organic loading rates, volatile solids destruction, biogas and methane productivity, resistance, and resiliency for these same facilities will be quantified. Advanced statistical tools will be used to identify which operational parameters have the largest impact on microbiome structures observed in the first research objective. Finally, laboratory-scale anaerobic digesters will be used to determine the effectiveness of using changes in operational parameters to shape the microbiome structure for maximizing biogas productivity, resistance, and/or resiliency. The results of this work address the greatest weaknesses of the tremendous amount of sequence data generated in these systems; namely that it is largely descriptive in nature with limited utility for designing systems and predicting future performance. The educational and outreach phase of this work will identify the effectiveness of using sequential cartoons to increase the comprehension and retention of complex environmental issues in K-12 students with the goal of lowering barriers to participation in the field of environmental engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Actions, unlike predictions, have consequences and so, in seeking to take the right action, one must seek to understand its causal effect. This project deals with the problem of extracting causal-effect-maximizing personalized decision rules from observational data in sensitive applications. Observational data, which have become plentiful in domains such as medicine and civics, lack experimental manipulation so that isolated causal effects are obscured by complex selection processes, a phenomenon known as confounding, and such data are also otherwise messy, noisy, biased, and often missing. Despite the promise of rich and plentiful observational data, current approaches cannot handle the unique challenges it poses and can lead to unreliable, unsafe, and unfair decision making unfit for sensitive applications. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive framework of rigorous theory and robust methodology to address this gap and enable trustworthy decision-making systems trained on observational data. The research and education plans are integrated through student advising and curriculum development and include targeted outreach efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research will proceed along three primary directions. The first is to develop methods and theory for algorithmic decision making in the presence of unobserved confounders. Whereas existing approaches tenuously rely on various unverifiable assumptions that ensure point-identification of causal effects, the project will develop robust learning methods that produce policies with certificates of safety and/or improvement backed by theoretical guarantees that do not rely on exact identification. The second is to develop methods and theory for robust and optimal weighting for policy learning to address issues of stability, limited overlap, time-to-event data, and noisy and missing observations. The third is to investigate algorithmic fairness of decision policies trained from observational data. The project will develop characterizations of fairness in settings where disparity metrics cannot be point-identified from data, whether due to biased selection or missing attributes and labels, as well as methods that can audit and enforce fairness in such settings. Through these thrusts, the project will both advance knowledge at the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, and optimization as well as broaden the scope of their integration with new problem domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, having separate washer and dryer appliances allows clothes to be cleaned and dried simultaneously. While all-in-one washer/dryer appliances exist, they are less efficient, limiting the overall amount of laundry that can be done at one time. Cells use this same compartmentalization strategy to facilitate the hundreds of different processes that must take place concurrently to maintain life. However, cells must also be able to adapt to changing environments and growth conditions. To address this challenge, cells have certain compartments that responsively appear and disappear. These dynamic compartments form via a phase transition of cell contents - a process akin to liquid water freezing to form solid ice cubes. This project will engineer these dynamic compartments from the ground-up. Using inspiration from biological systems and guidance from polymer science, new dynamic compartments will be built in bacteria. A library of new biomaterials will be prepared and their phase transitions (""water freezing"") will be evaluated in test tubes and living cells. These efforts will provide a fundamental understanding of how cells form these responsive compartments and will enable us to efficiently engineer new processes in cells.

The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomacromolecules has recently been appreciated as a mechanism for cellular subcompartmentalization. These phase separated compartments are termed membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates. This biological phase separation is driven by weak, multivalent interactions and shares many features with the well-studied phase separation of synthetic macromolecules (polymers). In particular, many membraneless organelles form via complex coacervation of nucleic acids and proteins - or the liquid-liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The goal of this project is to use the process of complex coacervation to artificially promote globular protein phase separation in E. coli. The design parameters for the in vivo formation of both single and multi-protein condensates will be determined. Model fluorescent proteins will be engineered with altered charge and charge distribution to create a library of supercharged protein polyions. The phase behavior of these engineered proteins with oppositely charged biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins) will be characterized in vitro and in vivo. The insights from these experiments will enable the creation of synthetic membraneless organelles with potential applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. These research objectives will be coupled with educational goals to improve the scientific and engineering literacy of incarcerated students.

To that end, the project will investigate a new class of catalytic materials known as single atom catalysts (SACs), specifically by developing computational modeling tools that will aid the discovery and design of SACs. The resulting fundamental understanding will enable rational design of robust and stable SACs for targeted challenging chemical transformations, thus providing the chemical and petroleum industries with new catalysts needed to maintain our Nation's competitiveness in the chemicals and energy sectors of the economy. These research advances will form the basis of quest-based workshop activities that teach catalysis and computation to Boston-area grade 6-12 students, advancing excitement about STEM.<br/> <br/>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are emergent catalytic materials that promise to unite the scalability of heterogeneous catalysts with the activity, selectivity, and atom-economy of homogeneous catalysts, but the reactivity of SACs is poorly understood. Short-lived, sub-nanoscale SAC active sites challenge the resolution of experimental spectroscopic techniques, making computational modeling essential to building understanding of the mechanism of SAC catalysts. The project will advance understanding of how SAC structure imparts unique reactivity for critical transformations (i.e., selective partial hydrocarbon oxidation) through systematically improvable computational modeling. Although SACs are poised as a new paradigm in selective but scalable catalysts, the very features that make SACs reactive for essential catalytic transformations also make conventional computational catalysis tools (i.e., semi-local density functional theory or DFT) ill suited to predictive SAC study. This project will identify and implement needed systematic advances beyond semi-local DFT for predictive modeling of how ligand-field-influenced spin- and oxidation-state of quantum-confined metals at SAC active sites alters reactivity. Advancement of fundamental understanding of single atom catalysts will be achieved through three aims: 1) quantifying spin state-dependent reactivity of SACs for selective transformations, 2) understanding how support identity and active site configuration/disorder influences electronic structure and reactivity of SACs, and 3) developing descriptors to predict and optimize SAC activity and stability. This will enable the tailoring of SACs for selectivity, activity, and scalability needed to address the ""holy grail"" challenge in catalysis of partial alkane oxidation. It will overhaul simulation methods for studying unique SAC electronic structure properties, both providing accurate predictions and incorporating disorder effects in rational SAC design. Development of SACs robust for the industrial scale with earth abundant, atom economical metal use will have a profound impact on the environment. The research advances will be integrated into outreach activities in a twice-yearly workshop that teaches catalysis and computation to grade 6-12 students, advancing excitement about STEM. The workshop will introduce catalysis and bonding concepts through 3D models, and students will design catalysts in a quest game adapted from software developed as part of this project.

The greater ani is a tropical bird that nests in groups: several females lay their eggs in a shared nest and help to raise the mixed clutch of nestlings. However, some females act as reproductive parasites, laying their eggs into a group's nest but providing no parental care. A female ani can therefore use two alternative tactics for reproduction: she can nest in a cooperative group and help to raise her own young, or she can act as a parasite and let another group do all of the work. But why do some females nest cooperatively, whereas others, in the same population, act as parasites? One goal of this project is to understand whether this behavior difference is due to underlying genetic differences, or whether it results from differences in the females' histories (for example, their body condition or the nutrition that they received during development). A related goal is to understand how a female's reproductive behaviors affect her male mate. Are males more successful if they pair with a parasitic female, or a cooperative female? Conversely, does a male's behavior affect whether his mate acts as a parasite or a cooperator? This research can provide significant insight into why reproductive behavioral variation occurs and how males and females coordinate behavior for maximal reproductive success. Field work for this project will take place in Panama, creating opportunities for formative research experiences for low-income high school and college students in the U.S. Finally, it will enable participation in a New Jersey state prison teaching program that serves one of the most neglected and under-served populations in the country.<br/><br/><br/>Individual variation in behavioral strategies poses an enduring evolutionary puzzle. When should selection favor divergent solutions to the same problem, instead of a single optimum? Disruptive selection, in which intermediate behavioral phenotypes have lower fitness than extreme alternatives, is thought to play a crucial role in the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in male animals. However, the evolutionary dynamics and proximate mechanisms influencing female ARTs remain poorly understood, although such strategies are widespread. The greater ani (Crotophaga major), a tropical bird that nests in social groups, provides a unique opportunity to answer fundamental questions about the evolution of female ARTs. Females typically lay their eggs in communal nests and share reproduction and parental care; however, a small minority of females consistently act as reproductive parasites, laying their eggs into the nest of a host group but providing no parental care. The co-existence of widespread parasitism and non-kin cooperation offers an ideal system in which to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolutionary origins and maintenance of female ARTs. The goals of this project are to 1) evaluate whether disruptive selection on reproductive investment favors discrete parasitic and communal tactics; 2) investigate the environmental and genetic mechanisms determining the expression of these strategies; and 3) understand evolutionary feedbacks between alternative female strategies and male fitness. Data on individual reproductive behaviors will be collected from a long-term field site in Panama, enabling direct estimates of heritability, reproductive output, and reproductive investment from a color-marked population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by focusing on two national challenges in STEM education: (i) the shortage of highly qualified STEM teachers, particularly in rural high-need schools; and (ii) the lack of prepared college-ready secondary students in STEM. The project is a collaboration between St. John Fisher College (SJFC), Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) and four rural high-need local central school districts (Sodus, Geneva, North Rose-Wolcott, and Penn Yan).  Through this partnership, the project aims to prepare twenty new STEM teachers over five years.  These teachers will be recruited from undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, mathematics physics, and computer science. The undergraduates will be provided with two-year scholarships to cover their unmet financial needs.  Project activities in collaboration with FLCC include early exposure of undergraduates to teaching as a career, and inclusion of FLCC transfer students in pre-service teaching activities. This innovative project plans to supplement curricular requirements with educational modules on Culturally Aware Mentorship (adopted from the University of Wisconsin-Madison), to develop lessons and laboratories that require minimal resources, to educate preservice teachers about trauma-sensitive classrooms, and to increase understanding of poverty's effects on learning environments.  Mentoring of Scholars and teachers will also be included. By promoting an educational partnership among local rural school districts, FLCC, and SJFC, this project aims to provide a replicable model of preparation of STEM teachers for high needs, rural school districts across the Nation.<br/><br/>The project aims to accomplish three objectives that address the national need for highly qualified STEM teachers:  1. Recruit twenty STEM undergraduate students, including transfer students from community colleges, to teach in rural environments and support them as they earn the credentials to become mathematics or science teachers; 2. Provide these Noyce Scholars with scholarships and an integrated enrichment and support program to equip them with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to teach effectively in high-need school districts; and 3. Create new knowledge through a research study measuring how introduction of trauma-sensitive pedagogy affects future STEM teachers and their classroom practices. The project aims to support new teachers through ongoing mentoring, professional development, and networking activities, including the development of a community of practice focused on creating trauma-sensitive school communities. Results will be widely shared through such means as publications, professional meetings, and conference presentations. Preparing highly capable STEM teachers trained in creating trauma-sensitive classrooms has the potential to improve educational outcomes as well as college readiness for students in high-needs and rural school districts, informing practices across the STEM community. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology and symmetry not only play an important role in arts and product designs, but they are also fundamental in determining the behaviors of the microscopic world. Even though such effects are largely elusive to the naked eye, certain aspects of their intriguing properties can be discerned using common optical devices, such as a laser not much more complicated than a price scanner. This project targets a major breakthrough in our understanding of how energy generation and dissipation, ubiquitous in optics and related fields, impact the physical rules governed by topology and symmetry. The outcome of this investigation is expected to advance our fundamental understanding in optics and physics, as well as in materials science and optoelectronics. By employing different paradigms to realize novel states enabled by topology and symmetry, optics and photonics can provide unique platforms beyond what nature has to offer and lead to technology innovations that have vital, real-world consequences. The success of the project may underpin a new generation of sophisticated photonic devices for optical communications and computing, which have far-reaching impacts on our daily lives and the whole society. This project aligns with the National Photonics Initiative, which aims at positioning the nation as a leader in next-generation photonics technologies; it is also an integral part of the strategic plan at the researcher's institute to promote cutting-edge research in photonics and other transformative areas.  Leveraging the resources from the City University of New York, the largest urban university system in the US, the researcher will work closely with multiple outreach units to increase the awareness and interest of K-12 students in modern optics and photonics across New York City. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide an excellent research opportunity for graduate, undergraduate, and advanced high-school students, and the research will actively recruit and mentor students especially from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This project explores the emerging juncture of two of the most energized fields in physics, namely topological phases of matter and non-Hermitian photonics based on novel symmetries. Built on the success of identifying the topological origin of the integer quantum Hall effect, the prediction and observation of topological insulators have created great excitement and put the study of topological phases of matter in the spotlight of modern physics. At the same time, the extension of quantum mechanics into the non-Hermitian regime using parity-time symmetry and its subsequent realization in photonics have led to an explosion of activities, exploring spontaneous symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian photonics and the counterintuitive phenomena they bring. Although there are promising findings combining these two exciting fields, it remains unclear how the complex-valued band structure of a non-Hermitian system is related to its edge states and to what extent the latter are protected by topology and symmetry. This project will tackle these important and other related questions through the following three aims: to investigate unusual topological edge states in non-Hermitian photonic media, focusing on their exotic localization properties and a new type of non-Hermitian Dirac and Weyl points; to examine a novel non-Hermitian symmetry termed complex mirror symmetry and its implication on high-order non-Hermitian degeneracies; and to probe the properties of symmetry-protected photonic zero-mode lasers using both semiclassical and quantum optical tools. Thanks to the flexible control of optical gain and loss, different paradigms towards building topological phases of matter in optics and photonics can be realized in non-Hermitian media, which not only enrich fundamental optical physics but also lead to unprecedented photonic devices with unique optical functionalities.<br/><br/>The Physics Division and The Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When rain falls on streets, rooftops, and other hard surfaces, contaminants can be washed into rivers and lakes, impacting aquatic life and drinking water sources. Green stormwater treatment was developed to remove stormwater contaminants as a solution to this problem. Although this technology has potential to transform stormwater from a waste to a valuable resource, the treatment mechanisms in most systems is poorly understood. This knowledge gap prevents the wider adoption of this technology. To address this gap, the research team will use cutting-edge chemical and biological analytical tools to understand how bacteria, fungi, and plants combine with engineered stormwater filter media for enhanced treatment efficiency. The broader impacts to society include wider adoption of inexpensive, low-maintenance stormwater treatment systems to improve water quality and protect the Nation's drinking water sources. The investigator will engage college and middle school students in the teaching-learning continuum to increase scientific literacy. An added benefit is the enhancement of the 'pipeline' of students from diverse backgrounds into the field of water supply science and engineering.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER project is to provide fundamental insights into the coupled biological and abiotic processes in stormwater green infrastructure systems to sustain contaminant removal. Specific objectives of the research plan are to: 1) discover novel approaches to bioaugment stormwater infiltration media; 2) determine uptake and transformation of stormwater contaminants in plants; and 3) characterize coupled biological-abiotic redox transformations. Advanced high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with semi-targeted metabolomics will be used to elucidate novel contaminant transformation products and pathways. New biological enrichment approaches will be applied to create stormwater filtration media with redox-active sorptive surfaces. Electron shuttling for stormwater contaminant transformation will be characterized using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The research plan will be fully integrated into a formally-assessed education plan to engage the public on water quality and inspire and train the next generation of scientists and engineers. Educational objectives will: 1) create 8th grade water science and engineering content modules to meet teacher needs for next generation science standards by engaging university students; 2) host STEM education teachers for hands-on research experiences; 3) engage members of the public on stormwater quality topics at STEM festivals; and 4) disseminate research to current practitioners and decision makers. The integrated research and education plan will help move society toward low-energy water quality solutions in the face of increasing impacts from non-point pollutants and shift stormwater from a waste to a resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This creates systems where nearly all parts are near an interface making the resulting performance primarily dependent on the local material properties near these interfaces.  Recent observations have demonstrated an unanticipated strong coupling of dynamics across dissimilar polymer interfaces established during final materials processing and interface formation.  The planned research aims to understand what controls this dynamical coupling across dissimilar polymer domains and how interfaces mediate this behavior.  Experiments on simplified systems using a series of different techniques will be carried out to investigate what property changes take place in multilayer systems during interface formation and how they alter the dynamics across the material.  Integrated with this research will be education of students as well as outreach.  Outreach efforts by the PI involve a partnership with Emory's Carlos Museum education programs to develop STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) programing for teachers and school groups covering scientific concepts used by ancient cultures such as historical water management strategies.  In collaboration with the Museum's Chief Conservator, undergraduate research projects will characterize polymer resins and their applications used in artwork conservation.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The planned research aims to understand what controls dynamical coupling across dissimilar polymer domains and how interfaces mediate this behavior.  Experiments on simplified systems using a series of different techniques will be carried out to investigate what property changes take place in multilayer systems during interface annealing that alter the dynamics across the material.  Comparison of results using multiple experimental techniques on a given system will provide a fuller picture of the relevant phenomena and thus facilitate improved understanding.  Experiments on multilayer films with varying layer thicknesses will be done using the following techniques:  quartz crystal microscopy to investigate changes in shear wave propagation across dissimilar polymer interfaces upon progressive interface annealing, ellipsometry to study changes in physical aging due to the impact of glassy-rubbery polymer interfaces, and differential scanning calorimetry to compare glass transition breadths and temperature-dependent heat capacities.  Results from these techniques will be correlated or contrasted to localized depth-dependent measurements of the glass transition temperature using fluorescence on equivalent systems.  The goals of this project are to address which experimentally measurable factors change during interface formation leading to dynamical coupling between different polymer domains, and how finite domain sizes (changing boundary conditions) alter this phenomenon.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the central nervous system, physiological levels of calcium play an important role in neural activity and in transporting signals across neuronal networks. In contrast, highly elevated levels of calcium ions are associated with dysfunctional communication and can lead to the degeneration of the neuronal network. Recently, it has been demonstrated that magnetic nanoparticles can be used to mechanically open calcium channels allowing calcium ions to enter neurons through the cell membrane. How this intentional, force-mediated influx of calcium ions interacts with structures inside neurons and how it spreads within a neuronal network is highly important for understanding force-mediated brain cell communication and degenerative diseases. This award will fund a research program that links nanomaterials to neurobiological systems and aims to capture and to quantify calcium signal transport in experimentally grown, controlled neuronal networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will benefit from an enhanced research infrastructure combining nanotools and neuroengineering. These nanotools will also become available to a broader research community interested in analyzing changes in communication patterns during degeneration or stem cell development. Finally, the project will involve the creation of an interdisciplinary bio micro-electro-mechanical system (BioMEMS) course to advance the STEM workforce in Montana, and science communication summer workshops for students specifically interested in transforming engineering data into visual arts. <br/><br/>Stimulation through nanomagnetic forces is a tool that operates magnetic nanoparticles within magnetic fields to impose a mechanical force on associated objects. Within a biological context, this project considers brain cells that express mechanically sensitive ion channels and receptors as the target for nanomagnetic stimulation. Applying nanomagnetic forces to the membrane of neural networks in vitro has been shown to trigger an influx of calcium ions, recently. How the force stimulation relates to other neurophysiological events, however, remains unknown. In particular, the integration of subcellular biomechanics with innovative neuronal cell screening platforms has not been used in combination with nanomagnetic force stimulation, previously. This knowledge gap currently limits the broader experimental applicability of nanomagnetic stimulation. Hence, this project addresses current limitations of nanomagnetic force stimulation by unraveling how neuron-to-neuron communication is impacted by force-mediated intracellular changes in calcium signaling. The proposed work will systematically analyze how fast this force-mediated calcium influx in neuronal networks occurs, and how the architecture of a neuronal network impacts the spatial transport of evoked signals. Calcium fluorometry will be employed in combination with electrophysiology to assess the spatiotemporal aspects of subcellular calcium stimulation in rodent primary neurons. Furthermore, this project develops highly parallelized arrays of cell nano-manipulation and assessment tools with low-resolution live-cell calcium imaging to map calcium signal propagation across neuronal cultures. Research results from this proposal will pave the way to future use of mechanical stimulation as a precise neurophysiological tool. Based on this knowledge, the project will develop design guidelines for future neuro-therapeutics using magnetic nanoparticle-mediated force stimulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to elucidate the connection between phase transitions in the underlying statistical physics model and the computational complexity of these two problems.  The project features an integrated research and education plan, with the complementary goals of advancing fundamental knowledge of Gibbs measures and improving interdisciplinary mathematical education. The educational plan has activities aimed at three levels: outreach workshops to introduce high school students to mathematical research; the creation of tools for undergraduate instructors to implement effective pedagogical techniques; and the development of new graduate courses in applications of statistical physics across disciplines. <br/><br/>More specifically, the research has three main goals.  First, to develop efficient sampling algorithms for Gibbs measures in the low temperature, phase coexistence regime for models with a bounded number of ground states.

While time is generally understood in terms of quantifiable units such as hours, days, months and years, recent scholarship has highlighted that human experiences of time are diverse, and rooted in activities rather than objective measurements. As a discipline that tracks long-term processes of continuity and change, archaeology is particularly well-suited to tracing the rhythms and durations of a range of activities, everyday acts of cooking and consumption as well as events like death and commemoration. Further, archaeological studies emphasize how relationships between people and the material world - landscapes, monuments and objects - influence how people and societies form a sense of history, and develop their collective memory. These complex experiences of time have been significant historically and remain important in today's world, as seen in disputed claims to heritage, debates over the repatriation of museum objects, and a widespread interest in documenting and preserving traditional practices. Researchers collaborate with scholars and government officials in India to train students and produce knowledge about the past that is disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences. Additionally, this team of researchers will collaborate with local authorities to create a museum with finds excavated at Maski.<br/><br/>Shifting the focus from meaningful monuments to the sphere of everyday life, the research will study how the production and use of ceramic vessels shaped the rhythms of household activities in medieval south India.

Introducing resonators with strong quadratic nonlinearities to photonic devices can enable development of disruptive technologies for numerous applications. This is evident from more than 50 years of table-top nonlinear optics, over which a wide range of optical systems with extraordinary performance has been demonstrated and used for applications ranging from sensing to computing. This project is focused on bringing the depth and breadth of such functionalities to the micro-chip-scale integrated photonics, and enabling scalable solutions for a variety of real-life applications. The specific experiments of the project can lead to unprecedented solutions for our most daunting molecular sensing challenges through development of ideal compact sources for spectroscopy. They can also enable a scalable path for unconventional computing for some of our hardest computational problems in a variety of disciplines. The developed knowledge through this project will be applicable to other applications ranging from metrology to quantum information processing and optical communications. Students working on the project will get educated on conducting multi-disciplinary research, and the PI will incorporate the materials developed through this project in a course on frontiers of nonlinear optics. The team will participate in outreach activities targeting k-12 students with a large population of underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Technical DEscription:<br/>Optical resonators with strong quadratic nonlinearities are proven to provide a broad range of functionalities that are essential for sensing and information processing applications. However, despite their outstanding performance in table-top systems, their footprint, power consumption, and cost have been prohibitive for many real-life applications. Recent development of nanoscale photonic platforms with quadratic nonlinearities, for instance in lithium niobate, has enabled access to an unexplored regime of nonlinear photonics which promises overcoming these challenges. This regime is associated with significantly large nonlinearities, low losses, and potential for dispersion engineering. This project leverages these features to introduce a disruptive line of theoretical and experimental research on quadratically-nonlinear microresonators, and aims to (i) advance our understanding of this new regime of nonlinear photonics, (ii) utilize this micro-chip-based platform to lay the foundation for development of a new class of functionalities in photonic devices and systems, and (iii) demonstrate proof-of-concept experiments for on-chip nonlinear optical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinarily, the term fraud is applied to illegal behavior. Globally, however, fraud allegations seem increasingly to provide a more general language to express extreme dissatisfaction with both instiutions and individuals for actions that range from the merely misleading to the truly unlawful. This research investigates why the use of the language of fraud has expanded, the political and social effects this entails, and how people re-build trust in the wake of perceived betrayals. The research is important because trust is necessary for healthy economies and robust democratic political systems. Research findings will therefore be of interest to both policy makers and citizens who seek to promote civic participation and economic development.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken in the conjoined cities of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia. This site was chosen due to Bolivia's long history of donor-sponsored (including American-backed) rule-of-law reforms and concurrent projects encouraging entrepreneurship and the financial inclusion of the poor. Indeed, Bolivian fraud accusations frequently sit at the intersection of these two objectives: urging people to embrace entrepreneurship to lift themselves from poverty and ongoing efforts to stem economic crimes. The project builds on the researcher's decade-long fieldwork in Bolivia, allowing for longitudinal analyses and comparative data collection and the efficient use of funding. The researcher will gather data through a combination of qualitative research methods, including ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and archival research. Interviews will be conducted with regulatory officials, jurists, foreign donors, and NGO representatives to investigate the priority given to economic crimes and specifically fraud as an object of intervention. Archival data will provide insights into shifting regulations, historic pyramid scheme cases, and patterns in criminal cases related to fraud. Ethnographic research will focus on pyramid schemes and quasi-legal multilevel marketing companies. Findings from this research will illuminate the history, uses, and effects of fraud accusations and contribute to social science theory of fraud as a changing global category.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, traditional authentication protocols do not defend against ""root-attackers,"" i.e., attackers able to fully compromise the main operating system of a victim's device. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), specific hardware components available in modern mobile devices, can be used to mitigate this threat, since they run a separate, smaller codebase than the main operating system. This project explores how it is possible to use TEEs to implement ""root-resilient"" authentication protocols, i.e., authentication protocols effective against root-attackers.<br/><br/>This project is divided into three main tasks. The first task consists in performing a comprehensive study of the existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that developers of mobile apps can use to interact with TEEs. This study will concentrate on understanding if and how these APIs can be used to implement root-resilient authentication protocols. The second task focuses on developing an automated analysis system that will be used to perform a large-scale study assessing the security of TEE-based authentication protocols implemented by existing applications. The third task consists of implementing an authentication framework helping developers in using TEEs for authentication purposes.<br/><br/>The project has the potential to improve the security of millions of mobile device users by enabling root-resilient authentication in thousands of mobile application programs. By performing a large-scale analysis of such mobile ""apps"", this project will identify weaknesses in existing programs. Additionally, the authentication framework developed by this project could potentially allow thousands of developers to implement root-resilient authentication protocols with reduced effort. The developed software, techniques, and findings will be disseminated by releasing the source code of the implemented software, publishing academic articles, and presenting results at academic conferences.<br/><br/>In addition, produced software and data will also be shared on a dedicated website (http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~bianch/mobiletees/).

Examples include recommender systems, neural recordings, and influenza prediction, where decision-making is constantly updated as more data arrives and thus the problems are best represented with models capturing the online nature of data. With collective efforts from statistics, computer science, and optimization, a large toolbox has been developed to efficiently make an update to the model based on one data point at a time, whereas much less is explored about how to quantify uncertainty of the predictions in these online learning problems. For example, to what extent can we trust the predictions of an online learning algorithm, and how different would the predictions be by updating the model with more data? The investigator will develop a new framework involving theory, algorithms, and software to quantify uncertainty for a large class of online learning algorithms. The methods developed through this research project will be applied to large-scale classification problems in online learning, with the goal of enhancing interpretability of the predictions.  All methods will be implemented in software that will be broadly disseminated to practitioners who work on online learning tasks. The investigator will develop new courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels based on the research output to increase interaction across statistics, computer science, and optimization, and will mentor students with interests in these fields.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on the uncertainty arising from training on large-scale datasets with stochastic gradient descent and many of its variants, a class of immensely popular online learning algorithms that sequentially update the model parameters using computationally cheap but noisy gradients. The algorithmic randomness of stochastic gradient descent is potentially non-negligible and could even jeopardize the interpretation of predictions at worst. Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, the proposed research has a detailed research agenda that aims to obtain an in-depth understanding of uncertainty quantification for stochastic gradient descent through three fundamental topics: (1) constructing confidence intervals for online learning with convex objectives, (2) quantifying uncertainty for deep neural networks, and (3) accelerating stochastic optimization in the online setting. Taken together, the proposed research projects will build a firm foundation for integrating statistical inferential ideas into stochastic optimization using streaming data, with research output feeding back into the development of practical methodology for analyzing online datasets. The completion of this work will bring in various perspectives from statistics, optimization, and machine learning, leading to a comprehensive understanding of inferential properties of online learning algorithms and improved trustworthiness of the application of stochastic gradient descent in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the proliferation of sensitive data that needs to be processed, and the ever-growing computational power of adversarial parties, ensuring data privacy and security of the computing process represents a critical aspect for the design of modern distributed computing systems. This project aims at developing a theoretical foundation to investigate the performance of distributed computing in the presence of machines that are not trusted or well-protected. This project will promote undergraduate and graduate research, and the outcomes of the proposed research will be integrated into education.<br/><br/>This project considers two different distributed computing scenarios and seeks their theoretical performance limits. In the first scenario, the dataset contains sensitive information (such as clinical/genome information) and, when distributed, has to remain confidential from the machines. An optimization framework is used which seeks to quantify the trade-off between the performance of the computing task and the level of data privacy that can be guaranteed. In the second scenario, the machines may have been compromised and hence may introduce false information to the system. The main focus is on the design of distributed computing techniques that are robust to different message-tampering attacks and allow one to efficiently identify the attacked machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications of LTPs are diverse and include bonding of advanced lightweight structural materials, semiconductor processing, carbon dioxide utilization, wastewater treatment, plasma-assisted wound healing, and agricultural technologies. The discovery and exploration of LTP activation processes has historically proceeded by trial and error, which is expensive and time-consuming. This proposal aims to develop a fundamental understanding of LTPs to accelerate the development of new applications based on them.<br/><br/>The research hypothesis of this project is that chemical reactions occurring in LTPs proceed towards a superlocal equilibrium state, which can be derived from first principles. Preliminary data supports the hypothesis, which will be further tested experimentally using gas-phase reactions that are of interest for energy and environmental applications.  Under conditions of superlocal equilibrium, different species can have different temperatures at the same location in space. The superlocal equilibrium state in LTPs is expected to be a function of the background gas temperature, electron temperature, total pressure, electron concentration, and mole numbers of different species. Chemical systems containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen will be studied that are of considerable interest for energy and environmental applications, with carbon dioxide and methane being two key molecules. To characterize the C-H-O system, which is multiphase, a robust and reliable method will be developed to measure plasma parameters over a wide pressure range in LTPs that produce solids.

Yet, it is still not clear how the many underlying chemical, physical, and biological processes interact to damage the kidneys during diabetes. It is challenging to monitor the damage to the kidneys inside a patient. The regions of the kidney that are damaged are very small and are deep within the body. It takes a long time for irreversible damage to accumulate to the point where non-invasive urine samples contain detectable quantities of proteins that leaked through the kidneys. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will connect several processes that have been shown individually to contribute to injury in kidneys due to diabetes into a sophisticated computer simulation. This computational tool will aid in understanding how the processes interact and how diabetic kidney damage begins and changes over time. In the long-term, results from this project will help to predict the impacts of many competing factors on kidney health during diabetes management. The computer simulation produced in the project can also be used to test and optimize treatments to slow the progression of DKD. The project also will involve a set of educational activities related to the scientific work. Several undergraduate and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities will work with the PI to conduct the research and educational activities. Educational modules related to the research will be delivered to a variety of groups including K-12 students, college students, and grandparents. Physical models of kidney tissues will be 3D-printed and shared with students and educators. The activities will expose many students and members of the public to biomedical engineering and computational science through engaging scientific demonstrations and interactive experiences.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop multiscale computational models to enhance understanding of the mechanisms governing tissue remodeling and damage as a result of diseases and infections and to simulate the treatment of those conditions to improve human health.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a novel computational approach for studying diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through a virtual kidney that can be used like a powerful, non-invasive microscope to look into the body to detect and monitor damage to the glomeruli (where most damage occurs) during the onset and progression of diabetic complications in the kidney. The virtual kidney platform will use multiscale computational modeling to connect effects at different length scales from smaller to larger: inside cells, between adjacent cells, across a single glomerulus, and among collections of glomeruli interacting with other tissues in a kidney. A hybrid computational approach will take advantage of the benefits of stochastic differential equations to describe chemical species that react and interact in large quantities and of agent-based models to describe cells and chemical species that interact in small quantities or in qualitative up- or down-regulation fashions.  The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST AIM is to formulate cellular level mathematical models of biochemical cell signaling networks responsible for damage in each of the three main glomerular zones: a) podocytes, b) mesangial cells and mesangial matrix and c) endothelial cells and the glomerular basement membrane.  Computational tools will be developed for importing biochemical networks, conducting uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, and validating model results for the three zones.  To assess validity, computational models will be compared to experimental evidence gleaned from the literature. The SECOND AIM is to build a virtual kidney computational model focusing on crosstalk, structural, and hemodynamic effects on the primary tissue compartments within multiple nephrons.  Steps include:  a) constructing a hybrid computational model for tissue level simulation of glomerular cells that combines information from reactions in single cells, connects multiple interacting cells and transports glucose and other molecules through the mesangium and the glomerular filtration barrier; b) connecting the glomerular models to a tubule and vessel centric-model for blood flow and filtration regulation and c) validating the virtual kidney model and simulating responses to stimuli.  A user-friendly interface will be created for specifying model input and stimuli, running the simulations, and visualizing results.  Simulations of the virtual kidney model will be rigorously compared to pharmacological, physiological, and histological data, primarily from humans.  After model validation to a subset of the data cases, in silico experiments will be conducted to predict the magnitudes and rates of change for glomerular injury outcomes including proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under DKD pathophysiological conditions.  The metric for success will be the accurate simulation of the classic trajectory of onset and progression of DKD subject to clinically relevant input and stimuli.  Computational tools and code developed will be distributed openly via GitHub repositories, which may be of broad interest to the systems biology research community using SBML and/or CompuCell3D.  In summary, the project addresses the critical need to compile the multiple mechanistic processes that contribute to DKD onset and progression into a user-friendly systematic framework capable of taking the interconnected chemical, physical, and biological factors into account in a coupled fashion and in the appropriate magnitudes and sequences to make testable predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the understanding of the recruitment of marine invertebrates is based on theories centered on per-offspring investment, the dispersal of offspring in the ocean, and the survival of offspring during development. A major, largely neglected, area of research of the recruitment of marine invertebrates is the potential for asexual propagation of offspring during the embryonic and/or larval stages, also called cloning. Cloning is widely known to occur in diverse marine taxa, but the ecological consequences of this phenomenon are poorly understood. This project examines the ecology of cloning in Echinoderms, the taxon in which it is most widely reported. The work identifies the environmental triggers of cloning and tests the consequences of cloning at different stages in the life cycle. The work also trains undergraduate students, K-5 students and adult learners through research experiences, school presentations, and short courses in Maine and Virginia. <br/><br/>This project systematically evaluates inducers and consequences of cloning in multiple species from two temperate coastal habitats. Specifically, the work addresses two primary questions: 1) What are the environmental inducers of cloning and how likely are cloning events to occur in nature? 2) What are the consequences of cloning events for the recruitment of echinoderms into benthic communities? Current understanding of the initiation of cloning suggests that multiple stressors can induce cloning. Yet potential inducers have only rarely been investigated in a systematic fashion and never across multiple species within habitats or across habitats. The current project does both, assessing the potential for variation in biotic (algal food cues and predator cues) and abiotic (temperature, pH and salinity) parameters to induce cloning events in seven species of temperate echinoderms from two coastal areas (the Gulf of Maine and the Salish Sea). In addition to identifying inducers of cloning, very little is known about the fates of clones or the primary larvae that produce them, and therefore the ecological importance of this developmental phenomenon is a black box. As part of answering this second question, the investigators track the fates of clones that are generated at three different life stages (zygotic clones, early larval clones and late larval clones) to metamorphosis and beyond to determine the potential contribution of cloning to juvenile recruitment. By tracking the fates of clones to metamorphosis and in the weeks immediately following metamorphosis, when the vast majority of mortality occurs, they can estimate the degree to which cloning may be a viable developmental pathway for marine invertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus of the research is on the fundamental physics that governs the interactions, with specific applications to the California Current System. The California Current System is an eddy-rich eastern boundary upwelling region where energetic near inertial waves (NIWs) and tidal IWs (internal tides) have been previously observed and that will likely be used for NASA's Surface Water & Ocean Topography (SWOT) calibration and validation experiment. The approach will be to conduct a hierarchy of idealized and realistic state of the art numerical simulations in conjecture with in situ mooring observations for testing the realism of the models. The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude tides and wind-forced NIWs. The PIs will engage in standard avenues for scientific communication, namely papers, seminars and presentations at society meetings. In addition, the proposed work will promote the career development of an early career scientist and support one postdoc, one PhD student and one MS student. The project will also support two summers of undergraduate research and the travel to the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (coessing.org). This school, founded by one of the project team members, provides an opportunity for students from African countries to learn about oceanography.<br/><br/>The general circulation of the ocean is strongly constrained by the pathways that kinetic and available potential energy take from the basin-scale forces that inject them to centimeter scales, where they are depleted. To determine the ocean's response to future climate scenarios, these energetic pathways, from forcing to dissipation, must be understood and quantified. Previous studies have established the importance of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations to the kinetic energy route to dissipation, and of near-inertial and tidal IWs to the available-potential energy route to mixing, but a comprehensive study of the coupling between the two routes and the role of the eddy-wave interactions has not been carried out. Here the realistic simulations together with idealized simulations that will methodically investigate the interactions under variable stratification, rotation, and forcing magnitudes, will greatly advance the understanding of present and future oceanic energy distributions. The work will advance current understanding of ocean energetics, and will guide the development of diffusive parameterizations that take into account the combined spatiotermporal contributions of the different phenomena to energy mixing and dissipation. These parameterizations can be implemented in climate models and improve climate projections. In addition, this work will greatly ameliorate the interpretability of present and future satellite sea-surface height observations, whose analysis will be complicated by incoherent internal wave signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds lag far behind their more advantaged peers in an essential component of psychological reasoning, false-belief understanding. This is troubling because psychological reasoning is vital for navigating everyday life, and deficits in this skill could have serious negative consequences for the intellectual, social, and moral development of disadvantaged children, as well as their long-term well-being. This project will substantially advance understanding of how and why economic inequality influences children's psychological reasoning. This project thus has significant potential to understand perspective taking processes in children, as well as to improve the developmental outcomes of disadvantaged children. The findings could inform interventions designed to enhance psychological reasoning skills.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable evidence for an economic disparity in false-belief understanding, the nature of this disparity is unclear because prior studies have used a single type of paradigm that children could fail for many reasons. To address this issue, a sample of socioeconomically diverse preschool children will complete multiple types of false-belief paradigms that target different facets of false-belief understanding, including several novel paradigms that have not previously been used to examine this disparity. Patterns of associations between socioeconomic status and task performance will be used to characterize the underlying nature of the socioeconomic disparity in false-belief understanding. Few studies have examined the mechanism by which socioeconomic status affects false-belief understanding, and thus little is known about the cause of this disparity. This project will test the hypothesis that this disparity arises via socioeconomic effects on parent-child interactions. Specifically, the researchers predict that less stressed and more knowledgeable parents will use more terms that refer to mental states such as ""think"" and ""know"". Parents' language use will be assessed during several interactive activities with their child. Structural equation modeling will be used to evaluate the proposed pathways from socioeconomic status to false-belief understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award seeks to address this by applying laser peening, a local deformation process that induces favorable compressive stresses and reduces corrosion rates, to the entire material volume and not just its surface as conventionally undertaken. This will be done by implementing laser peening at intermediate stages during additive manufacturing, a process that builds parts in a layer by layer manner. If successful this project will result in new manufacturing knowledge on printing defined mechanical properties in metallic materials that is extendable beyond magnesium alloys, and thus can provide the US manufacturing base with new capabilities to strengthen their competitiveness.   Educational components of the award that will increase future workforce preparedness include: (1) encouraging U.S. students' pursuit of advanced degrees in manufacturing, especially from underrepresented groups in STEM; (2) promoting entrepreneurship training and commercialization of fundamental additive manufacturing research through an engineering startup competition and participation in the NSF I-Corps Program; and (3) provide a pathway to employment for credentialed students through academic apprenticeships in additive manufacturing. Further, leveraging this project with the University's established outreach program with Navajo Technical University will better position Dine students to pursue research-oriented careers and start businesses that remain on tribal lands.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is isolate how strengthening mechanisms and residual stress caused by interspersing peened layers (i.e., barrier layers) inhibit dislocation motion and affect stress-corrosion behavior. The approach applies laser peening on multiple layers during printing to form an aggregate surface integrity throughout the entire build volume as opposed to a traditional external surface modification. Central to this goal is to understand how thermal inputs (from depositing the next layer of material), and mechanical inputs (from later peening stages) affect the favorable compressive stress profile induced by earlier peening steps. This will be achieved by 1) quantification of dislocation densities resulting from work hardening, grain refinement, and residual stresses, 2) verification of magnesium alloy strength and ductility resulting from varied spatial treatment frequencies, and 3) verification of increased stress-corrosion resistance.  This will result in a new mathematical model to predict how frequently to asynchronously print and peen a magnesium target to mitigate thermal and mechanical cancellation of previous peening steps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigation will document and characterize the amount of movement along this newly identified fault over multiple timescales, to better understand its displacement history and evolution relative to other faults in the region. To accomplish this end goal, the application of a new dating technique, 36Cl/10Be burial dating, will be developed. The societal impact of this study is high because the results will help refine earthquake hazard models that forecast the potential of future earthquakes and their recurrence in California. This study of seismogenic faults will then be integrated into a place-based mentoring program for undergraduate students, Promoting Undergraduate Research Experiences (PURE) in Geology at San Jose State University (SJSU). The program will provide opportunities for students to investigate fault processes and their associated hazard. <br/><br/>The development and application of the 36Cl/10Be burial dating technique in sediment over the 200,000 to 700,000 year age range will expand the capability and capacity of earth scientists to quantify geologic processes, such as rates of deformation of lateral faults, fold and thrust belts and sedimentary successions worldwide over a timescale missing in most geologic histories.  Accordingly, quantifying the continuous displacement history of faults and fault zones into mid-Quaternary timescales will provide new insights into the behavior of continental strike slip faults, in particular the San Andreas Fault. Such data are critical to understanding the evolution of fault systems. Detailed field and geochronologic data at multiple locations and timescales provide important constraints and boundary conditions that can be applied to geophysical models of plate boundary strain, faults, dynamic earthquake rupture models, seismologic models and models assessing seismic hazard.

Because some social groups in the United States have higher levels of college educated adults than others, these adults become an educational and social resource for working-class background youth from these same groups, who subsequently complete more years of schooling than they would otherwise. Thus initial differences in educational attainment are duplicated over time, thus posing challenges to some striving for upward mobility. This project will advance how this process of resource activation unfolds across different social groups. Moreover, the present study will examine whether these resources can be shared beyond the originating social communities to support academic achievement among peers of other social groups through youths? friendship networks.  The study will identify conditions under which high-school level social resources from some groups not only serve to enhance emerging educational mobility strategies of in-group members,  but also advance the social opportunity of working-class students from other social groups through peer networks. Findings will provide guidance for K-12 schools as they strive to encourage higher rates of enrollment in higher education and as well as achievement of post-secondary education among many social groups who are enrolled.  <br/><br/>This project analyzes observational and interview data from 120 high-school aged children of several social groups that vary in terms of average adult educational attainment and in terms of social resources. The project  will interview respondents using a questionnaire and semi-structured interview guide that collect demographic information, college preparation strategies, and access to various forms and origins of social resources. This project will also incorporate similar data from an existing sample of 45 parents and young adults whose help may be useful to high school students striving for upward mobility.  The project will use MaxQDA, which is a qualitative data analysis software that facilitates first and second cycle data coding, to manage, store and analyze all data gathered for this project. The project will also conduct participant observation in several high school settings, including campus sporting events, student free time and during parent-teacher-student organization meetings, to contextualize data produced via questionnaires and interviews.

To uncover basic principles that guide this process, this project investigates how a developmental gene in fruit flies controls their reproductive behaviors and nervous system development.  The project involves the application of cutting-edge genetic and neuroscience tools to identify the behaviorally-relevant neurons and their location within the key neural circuit, uncover how the gene contributes to the development of the circuit, the connections of the gene-expressing neurons within the circuit and their function, and what genes important for the behavioral output are regulated by the developmental gene.  This project also includes an education plan that integrates high school and undergraduate students into the research activities.  A discovery-based project is introduced to two Philadelphia-area high schools, including one with students from predominantly low-income households.  This aspect of the project examines whether authentic research experiences can enhance the attitudes of high school students towards STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>This work investigates the gene and neural networks that underlie sexual behavior in Drosophila focusing on the dissatisfaction (dsf) gene. Dsf encodes a tailless-like developmental nuclear receptor, mutations in which cause sex-specific courtship and fertility defects in both sexes. Preliminary work mapped most DSF-controlled phenotypes to an exceedingly sparse number (i.e., 3+) of interneurons. This project tests the hypothesis that dsf contributes to behavior by regulating the expression of target genes that specify the function and connectivity of discrete neural circuit elements for courtship. The project includes delineation of the position of the identified interneurons in the circuits that control courtship; determination of how dsf contributes to neurodevelopment and circuit connectivity; and identification of the genes that dsf transcriptionally regulates.  A key outcome of this work is the establishment of causal links between the activity of dsf, the development and function of the neural circuits it influences, and courtship behavior.  Additionally, this work will set the stage for understanding how dsf acts with other sexual differentiation regulatory genes either within or between neurons to pattern behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to understand when this dramatic landscape formed and how mountains fall apart, a process that is still active in the western U.S. today. The principal investigator and her students are using ancient rainwater, preserved for millions of years in volcanic ash, to measure elevations from the past 50 million years across Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, combined with the ages of sediments that have filled the valleys over time, to reconstruct the history of mountain building and collapse in the northern Rocky Mountains and Basin and Range. Through this project, the researcher aims to increase accessibility to geoscience for students of all levels. Students benefit from direct support for graduate and undergraduate research projects, development of widely accessible, hands-on investigative Google Earth activities for undergraduate courses, and summer internships for high school students from underrepresented groups, recruited via STEM Access and TRIO-Inspire programs. The project supports to broadening of representation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields through direct research support of an early career female geoscientist researcher and her students, and through the Tuff Talk podcast, which provides distance mentorship, coaching, and professional development to a broad audience through interactive interviews with successful women in Earth science. This research also uses a novel combination of analytical techniques in geochemistry and age dating, with the goal of refining these methods.<br/><br/>Elevated regions have an outsized influence on regional hydrology, global climate, erosion and deposition of sediment, and many other Earth processes. Orogens can maintain high topography well after the end of crustal shortening or mantle delamination, despite high gravitational potential energy and thermal weakening of the lithosphere. Although estimates of the timing of uplift have recently become common, we lack precise surface records of orogen collapse, even in the well-studied North American Cordillera. Measuring the timing and pace of surface lowering, and its effects on erosion and basin sedimentation, can provide us with insights into the drivers for that extension, and into the genesis and structure of the original orogen. The overall objective of this research is to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of topography across the North American Cordillera, including the timing, magnitude, and mechanisms of surface-lowering, conglomerate deposition, and drainage reorganization, thereby generating a holistic model of orogen collapse as expressed in the surface record. The principal investigator and her students quantify changes in surface topography by combining an innovative, widely distributed stable isotope proxy material with precise radiometric ages, and interpreting those data using an isotope-enabled global climate model to capture changes in elevation over time. Paleoelevation measurements are integrated with new provenance, exhumation, and sediment lag time data from the basin record to determine the onset of extension and test if surface deformation generated widespread conglomerate deposition. Results are used to discriminate between various potential mechanisms for orogenic collapse and to develop a model for the interactions between, and surface expressions of, core complex formation, slab rollback, and magmatism. Through the combination of multiple field and analytical datasets and the integration of findings, the project team is gaining a new understanding of the progression of North American Cordilleran surface lowering and the conditions necessary to initiate range-wide extension and lithospheric thinning.

Mathematical models are important because they can be used to explain systems and predict behavior.  Makerspaces, workspaces that encourage creative design using tools such as 3D printers, are becoming more common in K-12 schools.  Makerspaces can improve the mathematical learning of students because the students gain a better understanding of systems by experimenting, building, and tinkering.  However, professional development for teachers is critical for both makerspace technology and mathematical modeling to fulfill their promise of improving learning. To address this need, this project plans to establish the foundation to develop teacher leaders who can use making and modeling in their schools and mentor their colleagues in adopting them. Through this effort, this project plans to develop new graduate courses to train its students in making, modeling, and mentoring. There are also plans to create a regional network of partners to engage the community and ensure that the progress made through this project is sustained.  <br/><br/>This project aspires to build partnerships across the Baltimore region, bringing together TU faculty with stakeholders from Baltimore City Public Schools and Baltimore County Public Schools as well as mathematics teacher organizations and non-profit makerspaces. The primary goals of the Capacity Building project are to: (a) develop a coherent and connected sequence of courses to improve teacher knowledge and instructional practice in making, modeling and mentoring and (b) build and strengthen partnerships with local school districts and non-profit partners. The project will include a needs assessment which focuses on understanding what makerspace technology currently exists in these school districts, how it is being utilized, and the critical professional development needs of mathematics teachers. This needs assessment should inform course development as well as future plans for a Noyce Track 3 Master Teaching Fellowship program. Through a pilot implementation of the making and modeling graduate courses, this project plans to train teachers to effectively use makerspaces, iteratively improve the courses and add to the research base on technology education and mathematical modeling.  This project is important because it has the potential to serve as a national model for mathematics teacher education in makerspace technology and mathematical modeling. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.

Several recent technological, mathematical, and biological insights have motivated the departure from conventional forms of treatment; these include spatiotemporally fractionated therapy; proton therapy; combined photon, proton, and electron therapy; and arc therapy. However, the design of optimal personalized treatments with these new treatment approaches also present new mathematical challenges.

This movement of particles (bedload transport) shapes the river channel itself, influences the erosion of bed and banks, and helps give shape to the broader landscape. Measuring bedload transport is difficult, though, because it changes rapidly in both space and time and can be quite dangerous to collect data during the high-energy flood events when most material moves. This project will experiment with new measurement techniques that can be done safely outside of the river channel. The investigators will compare the vibration and sound energy collected by seismic sensors placed near the river bank with direct measurements of bedload transport collected by physical samplers set into the riverbed. Sampling will take place on two ephemeral streams in semi-arid regions of New Mexico, USA and Israel, streams which are usually dry, but which transport a great deal of material when they do flow during flash floods. The data generated by this project will be used to test and expand models of how bedload movement generates seismic energy, which will benefit a wide audience of scientists who want non-invasive methods to monitor river and bedload processes. In addition, because understanding how bedload moves is critical for river management, the results will assist water management agencies such as the US Bureau of Reclamation and the US Army Corp of Engineers. This project also trains diverse US and international students in hydrology, seismology, and geomorphology, with a project team that includes experts from the US, Israel, France, and Germany.  <br/><br/>Bedload flux is fundamental to river dynamics and landscape evolution, yet the collection of representative measurements of this key parameter is inhibited by its spatial and temporal variability as well as the challenge of sampling in high-energy environments (for example, desert flash floods) without altering transport. Surrogate methods are a promising approach, yet calibration remains a challenge, and the lower grain size limit of detection is uncertain. This project will take advantage of already-built infrastructure to directly measure bedload transport, use these data to calibrate acoustic surrogates, and then use both of these to calibrate and test seismic monitoring of bedload transport. This approach will provide vital field data to enable the advance of fluvial seismology and sediment transport modeling in drylands by testing theoretical models of bedload seismic energy generation. The study sites are ephemeral channels in semi-arid regions of New Mexico, USA, and Israel, at which riverbed slot samplers will monitor bedload flux at multiple locations across the channel. These data will be used to calibrate collocated pipe microphones that collect data throughout the flood. An array of ~ 70-80 short period, 3-component geophone seismometers will collect seismic data near the channel, which will then be compared with the direct and acoustic bedload data. In subsequent years, seismometers will also be deployed along the channel system to study the movement of bedload throughout an entire catchment. The data collection and analysis will refine the overarching theoretical framework of understanding for the transport of sand-rich gravel in semiarid and arid regions of our planet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urban areas across the nation struggle with recruitment and retention of teachers, particularly for STEM content areas. This Noyce project will offer undergraduate STEM students supplementary research opportunities throughout their degree program to expand their skill set as educators. Other project highlights include seminars with an Educational Studies Scholar-In-Residence, as well as professional development for Noyce scholars once they are teachers.  These supports will be supplemented by training teachers to understand the impact of culture on student learning.  This training will be analyzed as part of a research study that was designed to develop a model for improving teaching in high-need urban school districts.<br/><br/>The four project goals include: (1) recruiting 18 STEM majors to become Noyce scholars; (2) retaining Noyce scholars in high-need school districts after completion of the Noyce program; (3) preparing Noyce scholars to effectively implement culturally relevant practices in their STEM instruction; and (4) institutionalizing the supplemental (non-scholarship) project components. Project activities and supports will span the five-year project, beginning in each scholar's junior year and continuing through induction supports in the first years of teaching. To broaden the project's impact, the leadership team will research the correlation between culturally-relevant training and teacher retention as the scholars graduate and become STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Thus, the project's outcomes will contribute to identifying replicable academic experiences and evidence-based models for successful STEM teacher education that can be shared with other institutions. In turn, the project has the potential to influence teacher education and retention for urban, high-need districts nationwide.

The focus of the research is on the fundamental physics that governs the interactions, with specific applications to the California Current System. The California Current System is an eddy-rich eastern boundary upwelling region where energetic near inertial waves (NIWs) and tidal IWs (internal tides) have been previously observed and that will likely be used for NASA's Surface Water & Ocean Topography (SWOT) calibration and validation experiment. The approach will be to conduct a hierarchy of idealized and realistic state of the art numerical simulations in conjecture with in situ mooring observations for testing the realism of the models. The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude tides and wind-forced NIWs. The PIs will engage in standard avenues for scientific communication, namely papers, seminars and presentations at society meetings. In addition, the proposed work will promote the career development of an early career scientist and support one postdoc, one PhD student and one MS student. The project will also support two summers of undergraduate research and the travel to the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (coessing.org). This school, founded by one of the project team members, provides an opportunity for students from African countries to learn about oceanography.<br/><br/>The general circulation of the ocean is strongly constrained by the pathways that kinetic and available potential energy take from the basin-scale forces that inject them to centimeter scales, where they are depleted. To determine the ocean's response to future climate scenarios, these energetic pathways, from forcing to dissipation, must be understood and quantified. Previous studies have established the importance of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations to the kinetic energy route to dissipation, and of near-inertial and tidal IWs to the available-potential energy route to mixing, but a comprehensive study of the coupling between the two routes and the role of the eddy-wave interactions has not been carried out. Here the realistic simulations together with idealized simulations that will methodically investigate the interactions under variable stratification, rotation, and forcing magnitudes, will greatly advance the understanding of present and future oceanic energy distributions. The work will advance current understanding of ocean energetics, and will guide the development of diffusive parameterizations that take into account the combined spatiotermporal contributions of the different phenomena to energy mixing and dissipation. These parameterizations can be implemented in climate models and improve climate projections. In addition, this work will greatly ameliorate the interpretability of present and future satellite sea-surface height observations, whose analysis will be complicated by incoherent internal wave signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some polymers can be flexible and soft. Other polymers can be long and stiff. By combining stiff and flexible polymers in a single system formed on a surface, we have learned that we can make nanoscale spiky brush-like surfaces using careful temperature control and coating methods. The PI and his group plan to better understand this surface formation process by making new combinations of soft and stiff polymers, by using advanced tools to study their organization, and by employing computers to model the structure and to predict their behavior. This new way of making surfaces opens up many interesting applications. For example, the surface mimics the protein spikes present on virus surfaces that are used by nature to identify target cells, take part in the entry into the cell, and also to prevent identification by antibodies. These materials can be used to study the behavior of cells on topics ranging from how they work to the behavior of the immune system. Because the spikes are vertically aligned, they may also act as nanowires, so they can be used in energy production and storage systems like solar cells and batteries. Finally, these spikes may be piezoelectric, i.e. they could convert electrical energy to motion (or sound) and motion to electrical energy. This research program will also serve as a mechanism to teach students about polymers and materials science, create globally aware graduate students, and expose students to a collaborative environment. Graduate students will be able to work with the research groups of our collaborators as parts of teams and to take part in exchange visits. Lessons learned from these research programs will be used to teach K-12 students and to be applied in high school teachers' workshops. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Coil polymer brushes synthesized using living radical polymerization methods will be combined with rod brushes with high persistence lengths grown from surfaces made using a variety of living and pseudo-living chemistries. Phase separation aided by solvent processing and guided by nanolithography will be used to control in-plane structure. A variety of chemical and process methods will be used to limit macroscopic phase separation and thereby direct assembly of topographical and chemical structures. Brush growth will employ new, chemically tailored brush initiators for single chain and binary chain growth to form rod-coil mixed brush pairings. To direct brush structure and rod-coil phase separation, brush initiators will be patterned at length scales of a few 10s of nanometers using state-of-the-art lithography methods to control spacing of the brush spikes. Brush organization will be compared to computational predictions which will be used to guide both brush design and selection and to anticipate the resulting physical structure and aid characterization studies. Characterization of the brushes will be made using a selection of analytical methods including grazing incidence (GI) SAXS and WAXS, neutron reflectivity and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements. Studies of the conductivity and piezoelectric character of the rod-coil brush films will aid in our understanding of the mixed brush structure. Through collaborations, studies of these materials as cell membrane substrates, for targeted biomolecular binding, as piezoelectric and as conducting materials with unusual transport pathways, will also provide information about key length scales and rod-brush organization. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This last step is often very difficult, as there are multiple ways of gluing the pieces of the solution together.  The mathematical area of K-theory studies different ways of putting such solutions back together, as well as the relations behind differently-assembled pieces.  The invariants constructed by K-theory can be found in many fields, from number theory to algebraic geometry to topology.  This National Science Foundation award investigates novel connections between fields through a K-theoretic perspective, by studying how geometric objects, known as polytopes, varieties and manifolds, can be cut apart and reassembled.  By analyzing these geometric cut-and-paste problems using traditional K-theoretic techniques found in algebra, the project hopes to shed light on longstanding conjectures relating geometry and algebra.  The PI also intends to establish a K-12 math circle available to all local children, and the organization of a district-wide math club for 3-5 graders.  Currently, math clubs at schools are heavily dependent on parental involvement and are therefore only available when interested parents have students at the school; organizing such clubs under a central organization would help with institutional memory and make it available to more students.  <br/><br/>The research project consists of three parts. The first is an in-depth exploration of the scissors congruence of polytopes as it relates to the algebraic K-theory of the real and complex numbers.  Using Rognes' stable rank filtration the PI and collaborator Jonathan Campbell intend to construct maps between the filtered parts of Rognes' filtration and the derived scissors congruence of polytopes; the long-term goal of this project is to investigate the connections between scissors congruence groups and the Beilinson--Soule conjecture.  The second part of this project investigates the construction of derived motivic measures on the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties.  There are two main flavors of motivic measure: the cohomological measures, which involve structures on the cohomology of the variety, and the Hermitian measures, which involve enriching the Euler number.  These measures have proven extremely fruitful in studying the Grothendieck ring of varieties; the project proposes to lift these to the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties and use them to study the higher invariants of cut-and-paste problems on varieties.  The cohomological project is joint work with Jonathan Campbell and Jesse Wolfson; the Hermitian project is joint with Kirsten Wickelgren.  The third part of this project is an investigation of ""squares K-theory"", which uses four-term (instead of three-term) relations.  Such relations---for example, the principle of inclusion-exclusion [P] + [Q] = [P u Q] + [P n Q]---appear frequently in geometric cut-and-paste problems such as SK-invariants, Bittner's presentation of the Grothendieck ring of varieties, and the definitions of McMullen's polytope algebra.  The project proposes to extend the definition of K-theory to such relations, thus allowing the construction of higher derived invariants for these (and similar) problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Midwest Geometry Conference series began in 1991. Each conference is devoted to several topics in the broad area of geometry, which is the mathematical study of shapes and their relative properties. The main goal of this series is to create a focused environment in which graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and faculty in the Midwest can benefit from a lively exchange of ideas and from contact with leading geometers and topologists outside the region. The conference will have a mix of longer presentations by experts and shorter presentations by graduate students, with plenty of time for discussion between the talks. In addition, the organizers of the conference are deeply committed to fostering a more inclusive community in mathematics and have made it a goal to ensure the participation of women, underrepresented and minorities groups at all levels (participants, speakers, and organizers). <br/><br/>In these conferences, the term geometry is interpreted broadly and includes Riemannian geometry, relativity theory, differential topology, gauge theory, geometric partial differential equations, free boundary problems, phase transitions, nonlocal minimal surfaces and related fields. The subject has many applications in general relativity, image processing, computer science, biology and climatology, for example. Because of the broad variety of topics, each conference will focus on a different aspect and the organizers will spend time at the conference to finalize plans for the next conference, as well as managing the overall series. The structure of the rather large organizing committee allows senior faculty with considerable experience planning conferences to help junior faculty with less experience. The overall expectation is that the Midwest Geometry Conference will be a welcoming setting in which to discuss ideas, share advances in theory and applications, build a strong research network, and start new collaborations and mentoring projects.

As data are often collected and maintained at different sites, communication has become necessary for nearly every computational task. Moreover, decision makers naturally want to maintain a centralized view of all the data in a timely manner, which requires frequent queries on the distributed data and, in the extreme, continuous monitoring of the query output.  The cost of communication has naturally become the bottleneck for such applications. This project aims to develop communication-efficient solutions for distributed computation and monitoring. The products will be integrated into a trilogy of courses in the foundations of data science. The project will involve training students at all levels, with an emphasis on gender diversity and participation of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project targets three fundamental aspects of distributed computation: (1) the tradeoffs between the communication cost and the number of rounds of the computation in distributed one-shot computation, (2) the power of data partitioning, and (3) the connections between distributed one-shot computation and continuous monitoring.  The PI will approach these directions via the study of fundamental algorithmic problems in databases, data mining, networking, and machine learning. A systematic theory of communication-efficient computation and monitoring has the potential to impact a wide range of rapidly developing areas in theoretical foundations of big data, including streaming algorithms, sketching algorithms, and parallel and distributed computing. It will also deepen our understanding of communication complexity and information theory in theoretical computer science and mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tremendous advances in electron microscopy instrumentation continue to push the limits of what is possible, even with biological and organic compounds that are inherently susceptible to degradation from exposure to electron beams.  Nevertheless, many of the recent advances are not tailored for microscopy of polymers.  This project will develop electron microscopy tools to characterize the structure of conducting polymers in new ways and push the limits of imaging at the molecular or atomic scale.  These techniques will not only advance the fundamental science of how the chemical structure of polymers impacts the microstructure but also how chemistry affects macroscopic properties.  The emphasis on conjugated polymers will accelerate the development of flexible electronics and bioelectronics and thereby benefit society by impacting energy harvesting and health.  Furthermore, integrated educational and research activities will deliver a carefully tailored message to first year undergraduate students of how engineering can help society, as an effort to enhance recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups.  The investigator and graduate students involved in this project will further support diversity in engineering by offering mentorship and research experiences to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The planned research is centered on pushing the limits of polymer electron microscopy.  Recent work has demonstrated the importance of secondary events on radiation sensitivity, and these new concepts suggest new approaches to mitigate damage and thereby push the resolution limit.  An emphasis of the proposed work is on demonstrating the consequences of advances of detectors on polymer microscopy, including pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) detectors and direct electron detectors.  Resolving diffraction spots with a focused probe allows for 4D STEM, and therefore mapping of pi-pi stacking in a manner not otherwise possible.  In combination with auto-samplers, 4D STEM will allow of mapping of conductive pathways over large distances.  The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio of direct electron detectors enhances the sensitivity of energy-filtered TEM to differences in elemental composition, or when used in the low-loss regime, to differences in valence electronic structure.  Combining energy-filtered TEM with electron tomography will rely on such detector advances, to minimize the dose required for acquisition.  Furthermore, the automatic acquisition of thousands of images that can then be averaged to enhance the signal-to-noise of lattice planes, or even reconstruct the unit lattice, would push the resolution limit of polymer electron microscopy beyond the Glaeser equation for radiation damage.  <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We share, watch, and archive many aspects of our lives through them. However, designing and learning representations to understand these videos has proven challenging. Direct extensions of sequence or image-based convolutional neural networks to videos have yielded only moderate success. The goal of this project is to develop efficient, robust, and compact video representations. Every percent increase in the compression rate from this project translates into decreased internet traffic and more storage efficiency, reducing the massive economic and environmental costs of modern digital infrastructure. Any increase in recognition accuracy results in safer autonomous agents, more responsive surveillance and assistive technologies for the elderly, and a deeper understanding of video dynamics in sports and entertainment. Furthermore, this research will translate to the classroom through updated and new undergraduate and graduate-level courses on video recognition and compression.<br/><br/>The technical aim of this project is divided into four thrusts. The first thrust develops video recognition models inspired by video compression. The video compression community developed sophisticated, compact and efficient representations for video, used to store the bulk of digital media. The project will study what video compression can teach us about video representations, and how modern codec design can drive the structure of deep video models. The second thrust brings concepts from video recognition back to compression. The interplay between compression and recognition is not a one-way street. The project will investigate how video compression can be learned directly from data, side-stepping many of the manual design choices, and how video compression can learn to be robust to missing or corrupted information. The research team will develop a novel interpretation of video compression as repeated image interpolation. This interpretation opens the door to learned deep video compression algorithms. The third thrust studies the optical representation of motion for both recognition and compression tasks. At the core of both video compression and recognition lies a good representation of motion. The motion fields will be represented in a compact, compressible, temporally consistent, and easy to understand manner. Finally, the fourth thrust finds new supervisory signals, evaluation tasks, and their associated data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two key properties of these 2D materials - ability to absorb light and the ability to move charge - are often competing physical properties, where enhancement of one diminishes the other.  This research activity seeks to develop 2D materials with both high optical absorptivity and high electrical conductivity through nanometer-scale control of local surface chemistry.  The project investigates new chemical routes to functionalize 2D materials, and how optically active regions interact with electronically active regions on the surface of a single 2D sheet. Such functionality is critical for a wide range of applications, including photodetectors, solar photovoltaics, and chemical sensors.  The project activities provide training to graduate and undergraduate students in the research areas of electrochemistry, surface science, chemical spectroscopy, and nanoscale transport phenomena.  Additionally, the research supports interactive laboratory activities for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged secondary school students, as well development of open source book chapters through the Open Textbook Library Initiative and the OAKTrust Digital Repository.<br/><br/>This research project explores new chemical pathways and techniques to improve both optical sensitivity and response time on atomically thin sheets of graphene, molybdenum disulfide, and telluride containing chalcogenides.  Chemically altering the surface of 2D materials to interact strongly with electromagnetic radiation without disrupting charge transport within the material is currently a significant challenge.  Here, chemical functionalization of 2D materials with optically active organic dyes and quantum dots is explored via multi-step electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions utilizing diazonium salts to create 2D materials possessing strong interaction with visible and infrared light.  Further, optical lithography and tip-based nanolithography provide routes to integrate optically active regions with regions of high electrical conductivity, such that charge states optically excited in one region can efficiently couple to adjacent regions.  The synthesis efforts are complimented by a wide range of optical and electronic measurement techniques, including nanoscale infrared microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy in concert with back-gated transistor measurements to investigate the effect of local chemical composition on charge excitation and transport. The fundamental knowledge gained in this study can be applied to impart unique optical, thermal, and mechanical properties to a wide range of 2D materials without sacrificing charge transport performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long-lasting international collaborative research and education programs are necessary to advance understanding of earthquake source physics and transfer the knowledge from the past events to future generations. To advance understanding of deformation and slip behaviors of megathrust plate boundary faults and physics of earthquakes in subduction zones, this project involves development of innovative deformation and friction experiments on natural fault rocks at elevated pressure and temperature conditions that are anticipated along the plate boundary faults. To expand students' learning opportunities on experimental rock deformation and subduction zone earthquake and tsunami hazards, the principal investigator develops new education programs including a senior capstone course, a training course for graduate students and early-career scientists in geoscience and engineering, and an international field trip that will educate students on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis and hazard mitigation for natural disasters. The education programs are designed to provide hands-on laboratory experience in rock deformation and insights into subduction zone earthquakes. Trough these programs, next-generation researchers will be trained to facilitate interdisciplinary and international collaborations on tectonic, geodynamic, and engineering problems and to advance the transfer of discovery and natural hazard mitigation to future generations. <br/><br/>Development of elevated pore fluid pressure along the megathrust plate boundary faults and thus low strength of faults are inferred from many geophysical and geological observations including low seismic velocity, high reflectivity taper angle of the accretionary prism wedge, and vein formation. This project will test the hypothesis that deformation and slip behaviors at low effective stress may control a spectrum of slip events and earthquakes observed along the megathrust plate boundary faults. A series of true-triaxial compression tests, conventional triaxial extension tests, and triaxial friction experiments under controlled pore pressure will be conducted on natural megathrust fault rocks. Low effective pressure at a range of loading paths and rates will be achieved by controlling of magnitude and pressurization rates of pore pressure. The series of experiments will document the effects of elevated pore pressure and loading paths and rates on the formation of shear, extensional, and hybrid extension-shear fracture and frictional behaviors, and thus can provide mechanical perspectives on vein formation associated with slip along the plate boundary faults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, individuals who do not help their neighbors erode the benefits of group living, which can destabilize the group. In the long run, the balance of these forces leads some populations and species to live in complex groups while others live solitary lives. Examples of species living in complex groups include ant and bee colonies, hyena clans, and human societies. Mathematical tools from evolutionary biology and economics have been used to predict when the benefits of group living might outweigh the costs. Although these predictions can explain broad patterns across the tree of life, they have not been updated to incorporate recent advances in DNA technology. These advances have revolutionized how scientists understand the influence of genes on human disease and have also helped biologists link genes to social behavior and the propensity to act cooperatively in groups in many different animals species. This research will develop new mathematical and computational tools for the scientific community that will explicitly incorporate these data so that biologists can better understand the history and function of genes that affect social behavior and group living. This knowledge will not only shed light on the evolutionary origins of cooperation and conflict, it will help biologists dissect the genetic basis of group living, which is important for understanding the mechanisms by which changes in the social environment might negatively impact human health. Students of all ages will be supported by this research and gain important mathematical and computational training. <br/><br/>This research will bridge evolutionary theory for social behavior with population genomics by creating new mathematical and computational tools that specifically address the role of genetic linkage, recombination, and epistasis in the evolution of complex social traits. These tools will include: (i) new population genetic methods and simulation tools for evaluating the role of reduced recombination in enhancing the evolution of cooperation; this could be a precursor to the evolution of ""super genes"" found in a number of social species; (ii) new methods for studying the coevolution of multiple traits and recombination itself, which will allow the study of the long-term evolution of supergenes; and (iii) new simulation approaches for investigating how gene regulatory interactions evolve when those genes underlie social traits, which will allow a better understanding of how social behavior affects the evolution of gene networks.

This work will investigate how nature innovates, by using insects as model organisms, and by assessing the significance of two proposed, alternative routes to novelty. The first route posits that much innovation is made possible through the re-use- and re-combination of already existing biological features, from genes to tissue types to organs, not unlike how the pre-existing building blocks of Lego creations can be reassembled and recombined to generate novel structures. The second route in turn emphasizes how novel traits may originate from scratch, piece by piece over time. Ultimately, the work will contrast the mechanisms, efficiency, and consequences of innovation via these two routes, and how they may help us understand why and how life on earth has innovated and diversified the way it has. This work will also be leveraged to further expand an existing, highly successful collaboration with a children's museum to train science teachers in support of Indiana Science Teaching Standards, and to develop teaching resources for special education and ESL students. Similarly, this work will be used to enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in science through the research team's participation in three award winning summer programs and the recruitment of minority High School students into the group for individualized summer research immersion. Lastly, this work will train at least six scientists in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>How novel, complex traits originate, how they integrate into preexisting contexts without disruption, and the developmental properties that facilitate their subsequent diversification, all remain overall poorly understood. This work utilizes horned beetles, and the disparate routes of innovation exemplified by different types of horns, to address these challenges. The first major objective focuses on prothoracic horns, which preliminary evidence strongly suggests have evolved through the repurposing of wing serial homologs, and explores how innovation may be facilitated and biased if it relies on the re-use of preassembled morphological structures, their developmental underpinnings and gene networks. The outcomes of this effort will be contrasted to those of the second major objective, which explores how innovation is enabled and directed in circumstances when large scale exaptation of pre-existing modules is not an option. This second objective will utilize the head horns of horned beetles as a focal trait, which lack even remote homology to other insect structures, and which preliminary data show evolved in the absence of large scale repurposing. Contrasting the outcomes of both objectives will afford assessment of the distinctness and commonalities of both routes of innovation with respect to biases, constraints, and resulting developmental architectures. This work will be executed using comparative RNAsequencing and surveys of gene function across multiple species selected based on their phylogenetic positions and the degree of innovation embodied by their focal traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thanks to close interactions with collaborators in data science and information technology, the investigator will ensure the practicability of the proposed research, leading to a real impact. The investigator will also devote herself to various outreach activities in the field of data science. For example, she will initiate a local network of students, faculty members, and domain experts to develop close ties between mathematics and industry as well as to broaden career opportunities for mathematics students.

In addition, she will advocate for the integration of mathematical modeling into K-16 education by collaborating with The University of Texas at Dallas Diversity Scholarship Program to reach out to mathematics/sciences teachers.<br/><br/>This project addresses important issues in extracting insights from data and training the next generation in the ""big data"" era. The research focuses on signal/image recovery from a limited number of measurements, in which ""limited"" refers to the fact that the amount of data that can be taken or transmitted is limited by technical or economic constraints. When data is insufficient, one often requires additional information from the application domain to build a mathematical model, followed by numerical methods. Questions to be explored in this project include: (1) how difficult is the process of extracting insights from data? (2) how should reasonable assumptions be taken into account to build a mathematical model? (3) how should an efficient algorithm be designed to find a model solution? More importantly, a feedback loop from insights to data will be introduced, i.e., (4) how to improve upon data acquisition so that information becomes easier to retrieve? As these questions mimic the standard procedure in mathematical modeling, the proposed research provides a plethora of illustrative examples to enrich the education of mathematical modeling. In fact, one of this CAREER award's educational objectives is to advocate the integration of mathematical modeling into K-16 education so that students will develop problem-solving skills in early ages. In addition, the proposed research requires close interactions with domain experts in business, industry, and government (BIG), where real-world problems come from. This requirement helps to fulfill another educational objective, that is, to promote BIG employment by providing adequate training for students in successful approaches to BIG problems together with BIG workforce skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The thawing of permafrost soils, for example, can release vast amounts of carbon to the atmosphere and cause widespread soil erosion. Erosion that exposes deep permafrost soil can in turn redistribute sediment and water across terrestrial and riverine systems. The investigators will take an integrative approach, analyzing paleoclimate fluctuations and watershed topography across space and time, to understand the relationship among climate, permafrost thaw, and soil erosion. Results will improve our ability to predict Arctic system change. Educational outreach to K-12 schools will involve designing hands-on experiments for a truck-based mobile science laboratory that visits schools in and around Pittsburgh, including those serving minorities and under-represented populations. Graduate and undergraduate students supported as part of this study will participate in both research and outreach activities, training a new generation of scientists.  <br/><br/>The influence of permafrost thaw on soil erosion is largely unquantified to date, as is the dependence of permafrost thaw and soil erosion on topographic attributes, latitudinal location, and climate. This study seeks to: (1) quantify the relationship between soil erosion and permafrost thaw in Arctic environments in the context of paleoclimate fluctuations; (2) explore the dependence of these processes on topographic attributes and latitudinal location; and (3) evaluate and improve the capability of landscape evolution models to simulate erosion in Arctic environments. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators will sample and analyze sediment cores from two clusters of lakes at different latitudinal locations in Alaska. They will integrate topographic analysis and geomorphologic modeling with the chemical signature of aged carbon that is sourced in thawed permafrost and preserved in lake sediments.

Though many such models of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems have been developed to simulate the motions of the beating heart and breathing, none faithfully replicates the mechanics of the diaphragm or faithfully mimics the three-dimensional twisting and compressive motion of the heart. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to build a lifelike, benchtop model that recreates the motion and function of the heart and the diaphragm using a combination of advanced robotic techniques and actual organic tissue.  This model will provide insights into physiology, pathology and interdependence of the systems and serve as an innovative and effective teaching tool for educating students on cardiovascular and respiratory physiology and pathology. It will also serve as an anatomically and physiologically accurate testbed for implantable cardiac devices, representing a vast improvement over existing models and ultimately reducing the requirement for testing devices in animal models. Finally, it will act as an impactful visualization tool for educating and engaging the broader community (for example in museums and in Children's hospitals). The PI will use this demonstration and teaching model as one of many approaches in a multi-pronged initiative to recruit, train and retain a new generation of women in academic scientific positions.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to shift the paradigm of benchtop simulators from one where the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are independently simulated with synthetic phantoms or ex vivo tissue and motion is passively driven by fluid or external components to one where functional dynamic tissue is recreated using programmable biomimetic soft active materials.  Synthetic soft robotic muscular simulators for the diaphragm and heart muscle (myocardium) will be combined with ex vivo biological tissue (entire lungs and intracardiac structures respectively) to create ""hybrid biorobots"" that will enable accurate representation of lung and heart motion, while preserving key anatomical structures, thus maintaining form while recapitulating function. Clinically derived motion data of the diaphragm and heart will be used to develop algorithms to ""program"" the design of fiber reinforced biomimetic soft actuators. Subsequently, these active elements will be embedded in anthropomorphic matrices to mimic the form and function of the diaphragm and heart. Diaphragm-driven breathing mechanics and  cardiovascular hemodynamics will be recreated using pressurized anatomical chambers and mock circulatory loops.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to create a modular, active biorobotic diaphragm that can be integrated into an in vitro testbed that can be used simulate physiological and pathological biomechanics and generate ex vivo lung ventilation. The in vitro testbed will integrate pressurized chambers separated by an interchangeable diaphragm mimic to replicate the physiologic pressures of the thoracic and abdominal cavities.  Soft-robotic actuators will be programmed to mimic the desired diaphragm motion trajectory as computationally extracted from clinical MRI data. This will be the first functional soft robotic diaphragm mimic to replicate a variety of clinically derived diaphragm motions.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to create a cardiovascular testbed including a biorobotic heart that recreates cardiac wall motion and generates pressure changes to simulate hemodynamic conditions. A novel hybrid fabrication process will be used to preserve the intracardiac structures (endothelial lining, septum, valves, papillary muscles and chordae tendinae) of the heart using ex vivo tissue (porcine hearts) or high-resolution 3D printing. The active heart muscle will be replaced with a synthetic soft material containing fiber-reinforced actuators oriented in desired configurations. The biorobotic heart will be integrated with a partially compliant vascular flow loop to simulate hemodynamics.  This will be the first realization of a soft biorobotic heart that integrates organic intracardiac tissue with soft robotic myocardium and the first cardiac simulator where cardiovascular hemodynamics are driven completely by a myocardial substitute that is capable of replicating twist as well as compression, which is critically important in the performance assessment of medical implants.  The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to integrate components to make a cardiorespiratory platform and to demonstrate its utility in a model to simulate respiratory and hemodynamic biomechanics of Fontan patients. Physical cavities of the respiratory simulator will be designed based on Fontan patients' CT and MRI data.  Based on previous work, a controller that actuates physiological pressure profiles during a breathing cycle in a simulated chest cavity of a Fontan patient with total cavopulmonary bypass will be developed.  The respiratory simulator will then be combined with a partially compliant vascular flow loop to simulate venous pressure and flow patterns of Fontan patients. This will be the first combined cardiorespiratory simulator using a soft robotic heart and diaphragm and the first platform to recreate the Fontan physiology including both trans-diaphragmatic pressures and abdominal pressure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When people move to a new place, they are likely to encounter people who speak with a dialect that differs from their own. In addition, even non-mobile people who live in urban areas are likely to encounter people who have moved to the city from a place with a different dialect. As a result of this geographic mobility, Americans are exposed to substantial variation in regional dialects throughout the lifespan. Some recent research suggests that exposure to different dialects as a result of geographic mobility affects how speech is processed in real time. In particular, greater exposure to dialect variation appears to make people more flexible in their parsing of the speech signal, potentially leading to more successful communication with people who speak unfamiliar dialects. The goal of this project is to understand how this flexibility in processing arises. An investigation of the factors underlying processing flexibility due to geographic mobility will allow for a consideration of how processing dialect variation compares to processing other difficult kinds of speech (such as fast speech, foreign-accented speech, and speech in noise or with an auditory prosthesis such as a cochlear implant), which has substantial implications for understanding the constraints on human flexibility in speech processing.<br/><br/>The project will examine whether the processing flexibility observed among mobile people is limited to the specific dialects to which a listener has been exposed or applies more generally to all unfamiliar dialects. It will also examine how the number of dialects that a person has exposure to and when that exposure occurs (for example, in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood) affects their processing flexibility for both familiar and unfamiliar dialects. Flexibility in speech processing will be examined in a series of speech perception experiments assessing the time course of word recognition and of adaptation to unfamiliar regional dialects. The specificity of the processing mechanism will be assessed by examining speech processing as a function of familiarity with particular regional dialects, such as Northern, Southern, and Mid-Atlantic American English. The effects of the amount and timing of dialect exposure will be assessed by recruiting a large sample of adult participants with a range of residential histories and travel experiences. All of the data collection for the project will be conducted in a language research laboratory that is located within a science museum in central Ohio.

Over the past years, nanotechnology has given rise to many novel nanotechnology-enabled devices with unprecedented performance and properties, which promise to generate a wide variety of products to improve our daily lives. Many devices require multi-material integration of arbitrarily designed three-dimensional nanostructures over large areas. However, conventional nanomanufacturing tools for mass production are tailored for microprocessor manufacturing and are not suitable for emerging nanotechnology applications. This project supports fundamental investigations into enabling a new process for high-throughput nano-patterning of functional nanocrystals. Such a capability allows mass production of emerging nano-devices with enhanced mechanical, thermal, optical and electrical properties for energy, healthcare, communication and defense applications. A facile capability to generate three-dimensional multi-material nanostructures accelerates innovation, commercialization and adoption of nanotechnology-enabled products, which impacts U.S. manufacturing, economy and security. This research involves multiple disciplines including manufacturing, thermophysics, chemistry, optics and material science, and motivates individuals from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science and engineering. The project develops an integrated curriculum that bridges the gap between nanomanufacturing science and industrial practice and serves the needs of the current and future workforce in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>Non-conventional patterning methods using nanocrystals as building blocks, such as nanoscale printing, assembly and direct writing, have many advantages in fabricating three-dimensional and multi-material nanostructures.

The objective of this CAREER project is to understand the nanoscale transport phenomena in laser-nanocrystal interactions and enable efficient, high-speed, scalable photo-patterning of nanocrystals. Specifically, a basic understanding of optical excitation, electron-vibration coupling, relaxation, and transformation processes that occur over a wide range of time scales from femtoseconds to nanoseconds in nano-confined systems is gained. Integrated numerical and experimental studies, including Ab-initio and Molecular Dynamics simulations, ultrafast optical probing and material characterizations are carried out to gain this understanding and establish the process-nanostructure-properties relationships. To demonstrate the scale-up capability and feasibility for targeted applications, parallel laser direct writing of functional nanostructures over large areas by scanning a massive array of beamlets at high speed are explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The suite of thermochronologic techniques has become essential for understanding the timing and rates of rock uplift and erosion in active or geologically young orogenic belts. This project focuses on a particularly promising and emerging area of research in deep-time (i.e. Precambrian) thermal histories. Deep-time thermochronology can be used to constrain the multiple phases of heating and cooling that have occurred over time spans of 100-1000 million years. This project will examine the timing and magnitude of erosion that created the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Great Unconformity in the midcontinent U.S. with zircon (uranium-thorium)/helium thermochronology. The erosion constraints obtained as part of this project will serve as crucial inputs for investigations of atmosphere-biosphere-lithosphere feedbacks that relate estimates of erosion to 1) the disassembly of the supercontinent Rodinia, 2) potential triggers for snowball Earth glaciations, and 3) the Cambrian explosion in biodiversity. The project will also seek to further refine the temperature sensitivity of the zircon (uranium-thorium)/helium thermochronometer. The project incorporates an outreach and education plan that seeks to instill an appreciation for the concept of deep-time among undergraduates and the public through the use of a world-class resource available at the University of Illinois: the Rare Book and Manuscript Library. This library houses an extensive collection of rare geologic books and manuscripts dating back to the Enlightenment, which will be utilized in exhibits and incorporated into geology courses. These activities will impart a cultural knowledge of the concept of geologic time, foster a deeper appreciation for how Earth scientists think, and allow undergraduate students to engage with pre-modern primary literature to provide historical context and target fundamental questions of their science.<br/><br/>This project focuses on advancing deep-time zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronologic methods at a fundamental level and uses these advancements to expand the range of thermal history related problems and questions that researchers can address. Investigations of the radiation damage-He diffusivity relationship in zircon and the kinetics for radiation damage annealing in zircon will help refine the temperature sensitivity of the zircon (U-Th)/He system. This research will advance our knowledge of the damage-diffusivity relationship via step-heating diffusion experiments on Sri Lankan zircon grains over a damage range for which currently only a single data point exists. Raman spectroscopy measurements from a suite of zircon grains with a wide range of radiation damage will be combined with thermal annealing experiments to provide new kinetics on the process of damage annealing in zircon. The advances in zircon (U-Th)/He deep-time thermochronology will help constrain the timing and magnitude of Neoproterozoic exhumation in the midcontinent U.S. through thermal history modeling. These results will be used to assess existing geodynamic models for the formation of the Great Unconformity, each of which predicts a different timing and magnitude of erosion, and thus provide insight into atmosphere-biosphere-lithosphere interactions in deep-time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This region hosts larger earthquakes than any other in the western United States. To understand the factors contributing to its seismicity, the PI's team will focus on vertical displacements using GPS and satellite radar data. Vertical deformation rates are key to the understanding of the processes generating earthquakes in convergent plate boundaries. Although it is challenging to measure accurately vertical displacements, ongoing technical advances improve the accuracy each year. The Mendocino Triple Junction is uniquely suited for this study because of its extremely high surface uplift rates. The team will model in three dimensions the deformation data and compare them with other geophysical observations. The goal is to separate and quantify the long-term, permanent, deformation from the short-term deformation which loads the faults and potentially drives earthquake ruptures. This work will contribute to better understand long-standing issues in active tectonics, such as the relationship between short-term and long-term deformation, as well as the mechanisms of crustal uplift in northern California. The two-year project will provide support for a female graduate student in Geology and the expected results will help assessing and forecasting earthquake hazards in the western United States.  <br/><br/>The accurate measurement of uplift rates at convergent plate margins provide critical information on the underlying processes generating earthquakes and building permanent topography. Measuring and interpreting uplift rates is challenging, as tectonic rates are slow and the relationship between short-term (over earthquake cycles) and long-term deformations remains unclear. The Mendocino Triple Junction, where the Pacific, Juan de Fuca, and North American plates meet, provides a unique natural laboratory for studying vertical deformation. In this region, geologic rates of coastal uplift are among the highest in the continental United States. Here, the PI's team will develop a dense interseismic velocity field of the Mendocino Triple Junction by integrating three types of geodetic data (GPS, InSAR, and GRACE). The goal is to use the three-dimensional dataset to test models of elastic interseismic strain accumulation, permanent inelastic deformation, and geodynamic crustal structure.

Each conference is devoted to several topics in the broad area of geometry, which is the mathematical study of shapes and their relative properties. The main goal of this series is to create a focused environment in which graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and faculty in the Midwest can benefit from a lively exchange of ideas and from contact with leading geometers and topologists outside the region. The conference will have a mix of longer presentations by experts and shorter presentations by graduate students, with plenty of time for discussion between the talks. In addition, the organizers of the conference are deeply committed to fostering a more inclusive community in mathematics and have made it a goal to ensure the participation of women, underrepresented and minorities groups at all levels (participants, speakers, and organizers). <br/><br/>In these conferences, the term geometry is interpreted broadly and includes Riemannian geometry, relativity theory, differential topology, gauge theory, geometric partial differential equations, free boundary problems, phase transitions, nonlocal minimal surfaces and related fields. The subject has many applications in general relativity, image processing, computer science, biology and climatology, for example. Because of the broad variety of topics, each conference will focus on a different aspect and the organizers will spend time at the conference to finalize plans for the next conference, as well as managing the overall series. The structure of the rather large organizing committee allows senior faculty with considerable experience planning conferences to help junior faculty with less experience. The overall expectation is that the Midwest Geometry Conference will be a welcoming setting in which to discuss ideas, share advances in theory and applications, build a strong research network, and start new collaborations and mentoring projects.

First, emissions trading transactions will be collated from the firm-level to the city-level and tested for association with city-level emissions reduction. Second, corporate emissions change will be (a) tested as an independent variable against city-level emissions change to determine if corporate change influences the emissions change of the cities in which they reside; and then (b) tested as a dependent variable against emissions trading system participation as an independent variable, to determine whether participation in emissions trading influences corporate emissions reduction.

The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude tides and wind-forced NIWs. The PIs will engage in standard avenues for scientific communication, namely papers, seminars and presentations at society meetings. In addition, the proposed work will promote the career development of an early career scientist and support one postdoc, one PhD student and one MS student. The project will also support two summers of undergraduate research and the travel to the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (coessing.org). This school, founded by one of the project team members, provides an opportunity for students from African countries to learn about oceanography.<br/><br/>The general circulation of the ocean is strongly constrained by the pathways that kinetic and available potential energy take from the basin-scale forces that inject them to centimeter scales, where they are depleted. To determine the ocean's response to future climate scenarios, these energetic pathways, from forcing to dissipation, must be understood and quantified. Previous studies have established the importance of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations to the kinetic energy route to dissipation, and of near-inertial and tidal IWs to the available-potential energy route to mixing, but a comprehensive study of the coupling between the two routes and the role of the eddy-wave interactions has not been carried out. Here the realistic simulations together with idealized simulations that will methodically investigate the interactions under variable stratification, rotation, and forcing magnitudes, will greatly advance the understanding of present and future oceanic energy distributions. The work will advance current understanding of ocean energetics, and will guide the development of diffusive parameterizations that take into account the combined spatiotermporal contributions of the different phenomena to energy mixing and dissipation. These parameterizations can be implemented in climate models and improve climate projections. In addition, this work will greatly ameliorate the interpretability of present and future satellite sea-surface height observations, whose analysis will be complicated by incoherent internal wave signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, there is no single remediation strategy capable of treating both types of pollutants simultaneously. To tackle the problem, an innovative biological treatment will be developed that employs bacteria growing on propane that are capable of simultaneously degrading both CAHs and 1,4-dioxane. Development of this approach requires the isolation of a diverse collection of bacterial strains capable of effective treatment under various field conditions. This novel remediation strategy is potentially transformative in its precision targeting for specific contaminated sites. An added benefit of this approach results from it being less disruptive to the environment compared to other available remedial strategies. Through laboratory experimentation and hands-on training with stakeholders, the investigator will develop the next generation of environmental remediation professionals. Recruitment of students from diverse backgrounds will broaden participation in these fields.<br/><br/>Bioremediation is frequently a preferred groundwater contamination treatment method because it uses a natural approach to degrade pollutants at relatively low cost. However, the success of this approach is highly dependent on the specific physiochemical characteristics and the indigenous microbiota of a given site, resulting in site-specific solutions with narrow applicability. To increase the effectiveness of bioremediation, the PI will establish a collection of propanotrophic isolates and consortia exhibiting robust degradation capabilities and environmental adaptabilities. This strategy relies on the synergy of conventional cultivation approaches and state-of-the-art biotechnologies such as metagenomics and single-cell genomic analysis to advance understanding of cometabolic biodegradation at the molecular, cellular, and microbial community levels. This research focuses on propane-inducible soluble di-iron monooxygenases (SDIMOs) as versatile biocatalysts, uniquely capable of degrading a variety of chlorinated solvents and 1,4-dioxane. Novel SDIMOs will be identified and their catalytic capacities and kinetics will be characterized in heterologous expression clones and knockout mutants. These insights will be used to refine the categories of SDIMOs to enable the design and interpretation of omics and other molecular biological tools to exploit the metabolic interactions among propanotrophic consortia obtained from different polluted habitats. Finally, bench-scale microcosm assays will be used to evaluate and compare the feasibility and reliability of conventional and diagnosis-based bioremediation strategies to advance their in situ applications. This research will be actively integrated with a core educational goal to cultivate the next generation of remediation professionals needed to address growing demand in the historically polluted New York-New Jersey-Connecticut tristate area. Taking advantage of the sizeable remediation industry in this area, the PI will engage students of all levels with a diverse range of on- and off-campus activities, such as guest lectures with environmental experts, professional workshops with alumni in the field, and University-sponsored research projects, as well as internships and networking opportunities with private and non-profit remediation organizations in the region. These experiences will give students critical access to applied research and training in the field, and foster long-lasting connections that are key catalysts for career success. Further, the PI will attract motivated students from underrepresented groups at two-year colleges and local high schools to take part in scientific seminars, laboratory tours, and part-time research opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased incidence and prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity have led to unsustainable growth in U.S. healthcare spending and have significantly impacted well-being. Currently, chronic diseases are managed by choosing treatments based on average patient outcomes in clinical studies with relatively homogeneous patient populations.  While it is well-recognized that an individual's disease trajectory is influenced by patient-specific traits, personalized treatment has been limited by difficulties in disentangling the complex relationships between treatment plans, patient characteristics, disease prognosis, and adherence to treatments. This award will support the development and validation of algorithms and models that combine data from large patient cohorts and from specific patients in order to bring management of chronic diseases into the home setting. The educational components of this award will support development of hands-on teaching modules and research mentoring opportunities, with the aim of broadening interest in operations research and its impact on problems in healthcare, particularly among underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This research will develop and analyze new tools to identify causal relationships from medical data, develop and analyze new tools to personalize treatments based upon identified causal relationships while considering dynamic and stochastic variations, and validate effectiveness of these tools through simulation studies based on medical datasets of diabetes and weight loss patients.

This research goes beyond existing approaches that identify only correlations in data and which generally lead to sub-optimal treatment plans. Anticipated outcomes of this research include new statistical and optimization models, new theoretical analyses, and a clinically-relevant understanding of the strengths and limitations of the developed models.

With advanced age, mitochondrial dysfunction can arise and contribute to many common degenerative diseases. Reduced mitochondrial efficiency, increased internal stresses, and altered mitochondrial organization within cells are associated with the biology of aging.  Therefore, there is a need to establish quantitative, non-invasive readouts of these age-related changes in mitochondria. This project will develop new image analysis tools and statistical models based on the natural fluorescence of two metabolic molecules, called cofactors, that are critical for the energy producing processes.  Distinct optical signatures will be identified through statistical models based on measurements of the intensity, time-based response, and spatial organization of the two cofactors within individual cells. These models of mitochondrial function will be validated and then applied to assess cells during anti-aging treatments. The models will also be used to understand how aging and obesity affect cellular metabolism. This research will be incorporated into educational and recruitment efforts to promote science and engineering. In particular, the project will allow for the expansion and development of new content for a biomedical engineering camp that exposes high school students from underrepresented groups to multidisciplinary biomedical research.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term career goal is to push the capabilities of imaging metabolic cofactors NADH and FAD to offer truly new insights into the dynamic changes in metabolism observed during development, repair, aging and disease.  Toward this goal, this project will develop advanced multiphoton imaging and analysis techniques to provide quantitative biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction based on the natural fluorescence of NADH and FAD, i.e., label-free imaging, and to use these biomarkers to advance understanding of the biology of aging.  The project will build on the PI's previous experience in NADH and FAD autofluorescence imaging and will establish a new analysis technique for rapid, single cell assessments of mitochondrial fractal dimension (FD) within cells.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to establish a set of optical biomarkers and statistical models to predict changes in mitochondrial structure and function.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that different combinations of multiphoton metrics can be used to separately predict different metabolic responses.  This will be accomplished by validating the FD-based method to rapidly quantify mitochondrial organization in individual cells and developing a linear mixed-effects model to predict redox state, ETC (electron transport chain) activity, and oxidative stress based only on endogenous cellular fluorescence.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to characterize the sensitivity of mitochondrial biomarkers to chronological age and common anti-aging treatments.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that decreased ETC activity and increased oxidative stress will be detected in cells from older patients and that sensitivity to anti-aging treatments will be dependent on their mechanism of action.  This will be accomplished by evaluating differences in mitochondrial metrics between young and old (31 and 88 year old) keratinocytes (skin cells) donated by healthy females and assessing the sensitivity of optical biomarkers to anti-aging treatments such as rapamycin.  The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to monitor the aging process over the entire lifespan of mice through non-invasive skin imaging and to evaluate the effect of normal and high-calorie diets.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that significant metabolic changes will be most strongly associated with HFD (High Fat Diet) mice and female mice upon the onset of peri-menopause at approximately 18 months of age.  This will be accomplished by quantifying the age-dependent changes in mitochondrial structure and function of keratinocytes in individual mice (50:50 sex split) every 2 months over their entire lifespan (approximately 2.5 years.) Though the project's efforts are focused on cellular aging in keratinocytes, findings could be applicable to other cell types and applications in which metabolic changes have been reported, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and wound healing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many AR infections in humans come from exposure to soil, water, and air. New methods are thus needed to measure the risk associated with environmental AR. This project seeks new techniques to identify genetic markers for AR microbes in different environmental settings. This information will be used to track the transmission of these markers through the environment. The project will educate students in environmental engineering and interdisciplinary problem solving to tackle complex problems like AR transmission. Research opportunities will also be created for Puerto Rican and Hispanic students to broaden understanding and participation in STEM. Results will be shared with the public in English and Spanish to educate diverse communities on the link between the environment and human health. Knowledge gained from this project will help transform environmental biotechnology to address environmental AR for the protection of human and ecological health.<br/><br/>The link between human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) is exemplified by one of our most pressing public health issues: antibiotic resistance. Environmental hot spots of antibiotic resistance have been identified using techniques that do not identify the genetic context of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). Failure to understand the microbial ecology and mechanisms driving the proliferation of ARGs in the environment limits our ability to characterize the hazard posted by these genes and prevents the development of engineering solutions to limit the spread of antibiotic resistant infectious disease. To address these issues, field surveys and datamining are proposed to: 1) provide guidance on best practices for linking functional genes to putative host cells in metagenomic data from mixed microbial communities; 2) characterize the diversity of the ARG carrying host cells; and 3) determine the prevalence of waterborne pathogens carrying an ARGs. Samples from these studies will help define the relative abundance of select ARGs across air, water, and biofilms. A laboratory experiment will be performed to determine the relative contribution of host growth versus horizontal gene transfer (HGT) under selective pressure. If a minimum concentration to promote HGT can be observed, the genetic context of environmental ARG will be defined under selecting conditions. By studying host cells, horizontal gene transfers, and genetic context as a function of water quality, this research will contribute fundamental knowledge on the factors controlling HGT in water. This information can be used towards design of engineered treatment systems and is of critical importance for understanding the transfer of resistance and understanding conditions that promote beneficial and limiting transfers of functional genes of importance. The data generated will help fulfill a critical data gap for quantitative microbial risk assessment for ARGs. The project will provide Broader Impacts by improving curriculum, promoting network building, and facilitating interdisciplinary problem solving through an interdisciplinary course. It will also build bridges to education in environmental engineering with Hispanic students and communities.

Due to their small size, particles smaller than 2.5 microns (called PM2.5) can be inhaled deep into human lungs. Once there, PM2.5 can cause damage to lung tissues by generating oxidants. PM2.5 levels are measured by mass abundance, but this metric does not predict health risk because different particles create different amounts of oxidants. The goal of this research is to develop an automated instrument to measure the capability of PM2.5 to generate oxidants. Particle constituents that generate oxidants will be quantified using novel chemical characterization and modeling. Successful development of this technology will transform our ability to rapidly measure health risk. Interactive summer camps involving high school students and teachers will be organized and an online module to assess PM2.5 exposure risk will be developed. Societal benefits will result from increasing scientific literacy and broadening participation of youth from diverse backgrounds in environmental engineering and public health.<br/><br/>Ambient PM2.5 is the fifth largest risk factor contributing to global burden of disease. Despite the confirmed association of PM2.5 mass concentrations with various human diseases, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of how they PM2.5 causes adverse health effects. The capability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important property of PM2.5 that may be the missing link between these associations. There are two major challenges in the widespread adoption of ROS as a measure of risk. First, ROS measurement is laborious and time-consuming in comparison to easily measured bulk PM2.5 mass. Second, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how particulate chemical components catalyze ROS generation. This project will develop an automated instrument for measuring all biologically plausible modes of ROS activity of ambient PM2.5. The instrument will be used to analyze the ROS activity of ambient PM2.5 samples collected from six sites in the Midwest US. The extensive dataset of ambient PM2.5 ROS activity will be integrated with a detailed chemical characterization scheme to identify the chemical components associated with different modes of ROS generation. The contribution of each component to total ROS activity will be quantified by applying regression-based modeling techniques. Successful development of a rapid and accurate identification of ROS-active chemical constituents would transform our ability to design effective particulate emission control strategies. Broader impacts of this research will result from the reduction of the global burden of the diseases associated with ambient PM. These results will be disseminated to a broad audience of K-12 students and teachers through summer camps, as well as the public through online risk prediction modules to increase the scientific literacy of the Nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While current research efforts have focused on detecting malicious commands that lead to physical damage, the investigator proposes to preemptively prevent the damage by disrupting and misleading adversaries' preparation before they issue the malicious commands. To achieve this objective, the proposed work includes: (i) characterizing dependencies between normal activities from both the cyber and physical domains in smart grids; (ii) determining a network spoofing paradigm to disrupt adversaries' knowledge of smart grids by injecting network packets on behalf of nonexistent computing nodes; and (iii) crafting decoy measurements to mislead adversaries into designing damage-free attack strategies. The proposed work will use software-defined networking (SDN) to prevent physical damage in smart grids without changing the grids' physical infrastructure. With the wide use of SDN in different CPSs, this work may serve as the basis for future research that extends to the broader domains of CPS and Internet-of-Things, which connect devices from different applications, such as smart health and smart home. Since CPS companies are upgrading their cyberinfrastructure with advanced network technologies, this work has promising applications in real utility environments to increase their resilience.<br/><br/>The proposed work has the potential to transform current passive detection methods into preemptive approaches that disarm adversaries with misleading information. This work includes the following thrusts: (i) Development of interdisciplinary methods to identify dependencies between activities from the cyber and physical domains by combining data analytics and system specifications. Driven by real data collected from deep-packet network monitoring enabled by the Bro network analyzer, these methods will reveal the thorough operational logic of smart grids by integrating knowledge from different disciplines. (ii) Creation of an SDN-based platform to determine a network spoofing paradigm that resembles normal activities. By establishing interactions between the Bro network analyzer and SDN network controllers, the investigator will use the modeling of system activities to inject network traffic that is statistically indistinguishable from normal traffic to prevent adversaries from learning the true system configuration, without affecting legitimate applications. (iii) Creation of an algorithm to craft decoy measurements that mislead adversaries. To craft the application-layer payload of the spoofed packets, the investigator will model adversaries' attack preparation procedure as an optimization problem and thus determine decoy measurements that will mislead adversaries into designing attacks that target nonexistent components to thus induce little if any physical damage. (iv) Validation of the proposed preemptive approach using a cyber-physical testbed that integrates real SDN-enabled switches and power system simulations driven by real operational data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A new concept, called Moving Target Defense or MTD, dynamically reconfigures systems to increase uncertainty and complexity for attackers, reduce their window of opportunity, and raise the costs of their reconnaissance and attack endeavors. All of these contribute towards increased security. Unfortunately, current moving target defense approaches tend to address only individual aspects or components of an IT system and not holistically the entire system.

Its focus on democratizing technology will help computing technologies and technological practices become more inclusive, affordable, accessible, and open to everyday citizens. Its emphasis on mechanisms, strategies, and techniques that broaden the possibility of citizen participation in technological innovation increases the opportunities for and retention of females and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering education. These findings and the developed prototype resulting from this work can be used to inform and address the needs of other computing communities seeking to be more open, accessible, and participative.  This research also promotes public engagement with science and technology on two levels: by generating interest in the science and technology research community to pursue research that supports bottom-up technological innovation, and by directly engaging many of those innovators in this scientific project.<br/> <br/>The long-term research agenda of this project explores computer-mediated collective innovation practices and is guided by the following research questions: (1) How, if at all, do independent game developers and creative live streamers perceive, understand, and interpret their technological practices as democratized? (2) What mechanisms, strategies, and techniques do they use to support such practices? (3) What requirements and designs for new sociotechnical systems could be identified to better support democratized technological practices for end-user driven technological innovation? This project entails an empirical and conceptual advance in computer-supported cooperative work and human-computer interaction research on bottom-up innovation and participatory culture by using new research contexts and datasets, which have implications beyond the gaming and live streaming communities. It not only discloses how a technological practice can be perceived and interpreted as democratized by everyday citizens, but also elucidates why a community embodies such an interpretation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sorghum, one of the world's most important monocot crops grown for food, feed, and fuel, suffers severe yield losses due to attack by phloem-feeding insects, including aphids. However, little is known about the extent of genetic variation that contributes to sorghum resistance or susceptibility to these insects. The goal of this project is to elucidate previously unknown sorghum resistance mechanisms to aphids in order to help design novel targets for pest control and reduce dependence on costly and harmful insecticides. The knowledge gained from this project identifies key genes, signaling networks, pathways, and/or regulatory mechanisms that underlie sorghum resistance to phloem-feeding insect pests. The broader impacts of the project include an innovative and comprehensive outreach/education program to understand plant resistance to insects by involving middle and secondary school teachers and middle school and undergraduate students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented groups, as they explore solutions to real-world situations involving concepts of plant resistance to insect pests. In addition, this project will provide multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral research associates in the areas of plant biology, genomics, and entomology.<br/><br/>The defense signaling networks underlying monocot crop resistance to aphids remain largely unknown, and this is especially true for sorghum. This project fills an important gap in current research by utilizing genomic resources to gain insight into the underlying genetic networks and phenotypic traits that contribute to sorghum resistance to aphids. Natural variation in a panel of sorghum inbred lines is used to elucidate the novel sources of sorghum resistance to sugarcane aphids. A combination of molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches enable a better understanding of the genetic basis of sorghum resistance to aphids. Four objectives are proposed: 1) characterization of SCA feeding behavior and the early physiological defense responses involved in sorghum resistance to aphids, 2) discovery of novel genes and the underlying transcriptional networks that contribute to sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, 3) determination of key defense metabolites in sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, and 4) development  and delivery of outreach and educational programs in plant insect interactions and plant defense for middle and secondary school teachers and middle students. The results from this project provide improved insight into how endogenous defenses and manipulation of defense signaling networks contribute to the development of more efficient and durable insect pest-resistant varieties of sorghum. Although the project focuses on sorghum, the knowledge gained has broader applications to other significant cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of  Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) in the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At all times, a plethora of connected devices, from smartphones to home assistants to motion detectors continuously sense and monitor our activities. While these devices provide us convenience, they are often backed by powerful analytics to sift through large volume of personal data, at times collected without our awareness or consent. Such personal data can reveal a lot about ourselves like our habits and lifestyles, which not only has great commercial value to advertisers to serve targeted ads, but can also be misused by insurance companies, repressive governments and cybercriminals. The goal of this project is to build a foundation for understanding the different ways in which every day Internet of Things devices can leak sensitive information about our lifestyles. The proposed work will benefit the society as a whole as people will become more aware of the security and privacy risks associated with household Internet of Things devices. The proposal can also help identify vulnerable communication protocols and consequentially lead to the design of new privacy-enhancing protocols. Furthermore, this project will expose both undergraduate and graduate students to cutting-edge analytic tools and help develop a globally competitive science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.<br/><br/>This project proposes to build a testbed to analyze the extent to which household Internet of Things devices can leak sensitive information about ourselves. The proposed testbed will facilitate research along the following directions: i) help determine the feasibility of performing side-channel attacks to infer not only what devices reside inside a household, but also what higher order activities users may be performing, for example, inferring whether a user is making a call using Amazon Alexa or taking a nap, or working out on a treadmill; ii) help determine what data is collected and with whom it is shared; iii) help build an information dashboard to notify users about the potential privacy risks. Building a scalable testbed that can interact with a wide variety of devices will require addressing a host of systems related challenges. The data analysis will utilize a variety of advanced statistical, signal processing and machine learning techniques. This project will provide a much-needed insight into the security and privacy threats imposed by emerging Internet of Things devices. The proposed work can lead to not only identifying devices that leak sensitive information, but at the same time foster the design of new privacy-enhancing technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Midwest Geometry Conference series began in 1991. Each conference is devoted to several topics in the broad area of geometry, which is the mathematical study of shapes and their relative properties. The main goal of this series is to create a focused environment in which graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, and faculty in the Midwest can benefit from a lively exchange of ideas and from contact with leading geometers and topologists outside the region. The conference will have a mix of longer presentations by experts and shorter presentations by graduate students, with plenty of time for discussion between the talks. In addition, the organizers of the conference are deeply committed to fostering a more inclusive community in mathematics and have made it a goal to ensure the participation of women, underrepresented and minorities groups at all levels (participants, speakers, and organizers). <br/><br/>In these conferences, the term geometry is interpreted broadly and includes Riemannian geometry, relativity theory, differential topology, gauge theory, geometric partial differential equations, free boundary problems, phase transitions, nonlocal minimal surfaces and related fields. The subject has many applications in general relativity, image processing, computer science, biology and climatology, for example. Because of the broad variety of topics, each conference will focus on a different aspect and the organizers will spend time at the conference to finalize plans for the next conference, as well as managing the overall series. The structure of the rather large organizing committee allows senior faculty with considerable experience planning conferences to help junior faculty with less experience. The overall expectation is that the Midwest Geometry Conference will be a welcoming setting in which to discuss ideas, share advances in theory and applications, build a strong research network, and start new collaborations and mentoring projects.

The main cause of battery failure is undesirable chemical side reactions within the device that are difficult to quantify and to understand. Because of the lack of fundamental understanding, engineers are less able to design materials and devices that can last the expected lifetimes. This CAREER project will conduct fundamental research on advanced solid-state hybrid electrolytes that have the potential for greater energy density while retaining a safe operating environment. These hybrid electrolytes could replace currently used liquid organic electrolytes that have had issues with long cycle life. The active material's (lithium ion) transport within the electrolyte and to the electrode is not fully understood in these hybrids. This project will address fundamental knowledge of the underlying physics and chemical transformations that support understanding of ionic transport in the hybrid electrolytes. This knowledge will also have far-reaching applications of chemical sensors, fuel cells, and other battery chemistries. The educational plan intends to integrate the research findings directly into the Nashville community through outreach programs run through the Vanderbilt Institute for Nanoscience Engineering, Vanderbilt Engineering Ambassadors, and a research internship program with Harpeth Hall School for Girls. All outreach activities seek to expand scientific and engineering opportunities to underrepresented communities in STEM. <br/><br/>This project will examine ionic transport pathways in a family of solid ion hybrid conductors. These electrolytes are composed of two different types of ion conductors: (1) polymers and (2) ceramics. Currently, it is unknown how ionic transport occurs between these two materials within the electrolyte. In order to achieve batteries that can be charged quickly and last a long time, it is necessary to control ion transport between these two materials. The research objective of this CAREER project is to understand ionic transport by focusing on the characterization of ion transport at the interfaces within the electrolyte.  There are two types of interfaces that can form in a solid electrolyte: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic interfaces occur in hybrid electrolytes between inorganic and organic constituents, and also occur in ceramic ion conductors at grain boundaries. These are examples of interfaces where an ion moves between ion conductors. Extrinsic interfaces are interfaces that emerge during device integration (electrode|electrolyte) and can affect performance. These interfaces involve transport between an ion conductor and a mixed ion and electron conductor. Establishing the role interfaces have on ionic transport will enable pathways toward achieving the competitive performance and functionality.  This project will use a multi-modal approach which couples physics-based modeling with electrochemical, spectroscopy, x-ray, and neutron experiments to describe transport mechanisms in hybrid solid electrolytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying motivation for the Institute is to attract more students into graduate work in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and facilitate their transition into research work at a time when demand for human resources with data analytic skills easily exceeds the supply. RUSIS @OSU will recruit selected underrepresented minority students and students with no easy access to a research experience at their institutions, including students from Community Colleges, Tribal Colleges, Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), with the specific goal of mentoring and training them for careers in research in the mathematical sciences and more specifically in Statistics. RUSIS@OSU will prepare students to compete globally in a vibrant world where data-driven decisions are becoming more prominent in all human endeavors. While the program has been successful in motivating and enticing students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences, it also provides the necessary tools for students to join the workforce in a wide range of professional positions. From academic jobs, to jobs in the pharmaceutical companies, private industry, government agencies and national laboratories, professional sports as data analysts, and climate scientists, the job outlook for statisticians and data scientists is excellent. <br/><br/>The goals of the summer at RUSIS@OSU are accomplished through the following mechanisms: (1) an intensive short course in probability and statistics and an intensive seminar in computation. In addition, topics in stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest will be discussed; (2) engaging the students in research projects from areas of current interest. Statistical thinking is ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life. Data Mining, Big Data, Data Analytics, Knowledge Discovery are terms that have been coined in the past to denote essentially the same thing: activities related to the extraction of information from data to advance science, technology, and society. Through mentoring and supervision by faculty, the students develop skills that will help them during graduate school and their graduate research stages; (3) the students, motivated by current interest in the development of new methodologies to respond to needs in high dimensional data analyses, will engage in research projects that will be selected from areas of current applied and theoretical interest (e.g. multiple comparisons, dimension reduction, random matrices, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, statistical genetics, massive data methodologies, and modeling of the power grid and other complex urban infrastructures).  Autonomous systems (e.g. autonomous cars) that make use of statistical techniques such as pattern recognition, statistical learning, and dimension reduction methodologies provide interesting problems; (4) students will present their results at national meetings and they will be mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. Short courses in LaTeX, and software used for research purposes (Mathematica, MatLab, R) will be taught; (5) visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Linus Pauling Institute @ OSU) will be organized; (6) the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation will be monitored and annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee will take place.<br/>More details about the REU Site are avaialble at https://stat.oregonstate.edu/rusis@OSU<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Networks are widely recognized across multiple disciplines as critically important for understanding how information spreads (communications), how illnesses spread (public health), how legislation is passed (political science), how norms and customs form (sociology), how companies and governments coordinate economic activities (economics & geography), how people form and maintain relationships (developmental psychology), and how threats to national security can be disrupted (intelligence).  Collecting data on these types of networks is often costly and impractical, which has limited progress in answering these questions.  Rather than attempt to measure directly the interactions between people (or companies, or cells, etc.), the new methods developed in this project will measure interactions indirectly by looking at patterns of similar behavior. For example, it would be impractical to ask everyone in a large city who they talk with, but we may be able to infer that two people talk with one another if they routinely attend the same events. This project will compare several different methods for making these inferences to determine which method (if any) is the most accurate. Identifying accurate methods for indirectly measuring networks is important because it will reduce the time and economic cost of answering research questions, such as those noted above, that have scientific and societal benefits.<br/><br/>The inferential methods investigated in this project are known as methods of backbone extraction. Given a bipartite projection network in which two agents (e.g., people) share some artifacts in common (e.g., they attend the same events), these methods determine whether they share enough artifacts in common to warrant the inference that they are linked (e.g., they interact with each other). Methods for making such inferences differ primarily by whether they control for nothing (e.g., an unconditional threshold), for the number of artifacts each agent has (e.g., a hypergeometric threshold), or for both the number of artifacts each agent has and the number of agents each artifact has (e.g., the fixed and stochastic degree sequence models). After implementation of several existing methods in a publicly available package for the R software and evaluation of their computational complexity, their ability to accurately recover known (i.e., ground truth) networks with varying structural properties from synthetic bipartite data that contain varying amounts of noise will be compared. In addition, the performance of these methods using two publicly available benchmark empirical bipartite datasets that have known ground truths will be tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a complex process involving signals inside cells, between cells, and between cells and their surrounding matrix. During growth, cells divide -- leading to expansion of the organ or structure that pushes against the matrix that surrounds it. The matrix acts to constrain the dividing cells. This expansion against the matrix results in a compressive force being generated on the cells. It is not currently understood how this constraint-induced compression affects future cell division and growth. However, it is known that diseases like cancer, which lead to the seemingly chaotic growth of tumors, often initiate and flourish in matrices that are significantly stiffer than healthy matrices. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award project will seek to determine how cells decide how much constraint-induced compression is healthy for them to grow against and how tumor cells evade such signals. The advancement in knowledge expected from this award can then be applied to support development of new treatment and characterization systems for cancer. The project will also engage, motivate, and educate future scientists and the community on the importance of mechanics in health and disease. These educational and outreach activities include three interactive modules for young high school students, participating in residential research summer programs for high school students, mentoring undergraduate student researchers, developing a graduate-level curriculum, and even collaborating with dancers to develop performances that communicate concepts of biomechanics to a broad audience.<br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to study tissue growth in malignant tissue as a function of the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, focusing on understanding the signaling pathways and cytoskeletal network mechanics through which cells transduce mechanical constraint during tissue growth. This is supported through three research objectives. The first objective will determine the proliferative potential and cell- and tissue-scale morphological development of breast cancer cells of increasing aggressiveness during mechanically constrained growth using well-defined hydrogel matrices. Measurements related to cellular and tissue morphology, as well as cellular division, will be quantified using time-lapse confocal microscopy as a function of the number of cells present and the matrix mechanical properties. The second objective will compare tissue- and cell-scale stress fields in the matrix and tissue for the panel of breast cancer cells of increasing aggressiveness. This will be done through imaging of tissue deformation caused during growth using fluorescent microbeads co-embedded in the matrix with the cells. The final objective seeks to determine the mechanism by which cells transduce mechanical constraint during division in tissue growth by examining the expression of proteins that are involved with force generation and sensing during cellular division and partially inhibiting those proteins to discern their individual roles. The scientific impact of this work will be significant, as it will significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of tumor growth and development -- key questions that must be answered to allow future developments in cancer treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is achieved through the rational design of fluorous phase-changing nanoparticles (PCNs), which undergo liquid-gas phase transitions in response to acoustic stimuli. While PCNs have enjoyed success as ultrasound imaging agents, their translation into drug delivery devices has been impeded by poor cargo loading and variable biologic outcomes. Building upon prior seminal work, this project will open new opportunities in the rational design of PCNs by understanding the interdependence of particle composition and tissue mechanics on their acoustic activation, and optimize the loading and delivery of biologic cargo. These objectives will be accomplished through three aims: (1) Prepare bio-inspired PCNs and identify how physical and chemical properties impacts their ultrasound activation; (2) Demonstrate successful dispersion of proteins into the liquid interior of fluorous PCNs and assess delivery under ultrasound; (3) Pair biophysical cell-based experiments with computational models of membrane mechanics to advance a more comprehensive mechanism for PCN-mediated cell permeabilization.  Success of this work will enable the design of PCNs with well controlled acoustic biophysics, yielding new biochemical tools that can be used to probe and manipulate cells within complex tissue microenvironments with high precision. Research findings from this project will be integrated with outreach activities to incorporate principles of biomaterial design and biophysics into K-12 education. Educational objectives include: (1) Examine the effect of integrating high-school students with undergraduate engineering design teams on recruitment and persistence in STEM education; and (2) Develop and implement an Ultrasound Olympics program that will provide transformative hands-on experiences to K-12 students in nanotechnology and bioacoustics. Leveraging an integrated research and outreach program, supported through rigorous and routine assessment, this project will advance new bio-nanotechnologies and improve student retention in emerging STEM fields.   <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The goal of this CAREER award is to develop a framework for the rational design of fluorous phase-changing nanoparticles (PCNs) that can be vaporized by ultrasound to afford transmembrane delivery of biomolecules into cells with spatial and temporal precision. Although PCNs have enjoyed success as ultrasound contrast agents, their translation into clinically useful delivery vehicles has yet to be realized. This is a consequence of two key gaps in knowledge that include: (1) a lack of well-defined structure-activity relationships defining how PCN physicochemical properties regulate their phase-changing behavior; and (2) an incomplete mechanistic understanding of how local tissue mechanics impacts PCN biophysics. Using template-driven peptide assembly, this project will prepare programmable PCNs to elucidate the influence of particle surface tension and size on their acoustic activation, as well as identify conditions that allow protein cargo to be loaded into, and delivered from, the fluorous liquid particle core. In parallel, this project will identify how particle-cell-matrix interactions work in concert to control the biophysics of PCNs at the cell surface during vaporization. To engage and train a new generation of diverse scientists in emerging biotechnologies, such as those explored here, this project will develop and implement an outreach program to integrate underrepresented K-12 students in STEM research. Activities will include incorporating underserved high-school students into undergraduate engineering design teams, and the creation of an Ultrasound Olympics workshop to engage grade 6-12 teachers and integrate bioengineering and acoustics concepts into the classroom. By linking the proposed research program with outreach activities, this project will contribute to the development of a competitive STEM workforce capable of tackling diverse challenges in biomaterials design, molecular biophysics and bioimaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global energy is largely obtained from burning nonrenewable fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary waste product. Successfully recycling CO2 emissions back into energy-rich chemical compounds could produce commodity chemicals and renewable fuels economically while reducing waste. However, CO2 is hard to react and requires additional complexes (catalysts) to assist in the conversion to other molecules. Despite considerable progress, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the principles that connect catalyst structure with catalyst performance. In this project, Dr. Jurss is developing new catalysts to understand how to develop more efficient CO2 catalysts. Dr. Jurss is actively engaged in recruiting and mentoring underrepresented undergraduates and Mississippi high school students through hands-on research programs.  These programs promote careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Dr. Jurss  and his students contribute to a series of engaging newspaper articles in Lafayette County, MS to increase public awareness and scientific literacy through the lens of renewable energy. <br/><br/>With funding from both the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) of NSF, Dr. Jurss (University of Mississippi) develops molecular catalysts based on two strategies involving highly tunable redox-active ligands and well-defined bimetallic catalysts, by which multiple redox equivalents can be accumulated at modest potentials to facilitate the efficient multielectron reduction of CO2. These complementary strategies center on understanding how geometric and electronic structure dictate activity, selectivity, and mechanism. In order to control catalyst structure, multidentate ligand frameworks with limited flexibility are developed to achieve more reactive geometries or explicit interactions between multiple metal active sites. Dr. Jurss is analyzing these systems with electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible and infrared spectroelectrochemistry, to establish structure-activity relationships, to elucidate reaction mechanisms, and to validate design principles for catalyst development. In parallel, Dr. Jurss is providing research opportunities in his laboratory that aim to increase the involvement of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines.

Such processes could help reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that may contribute to environmental changes. The combined use of electricity and catalysis (electrocatalysis) to convert carbon dioxide to valuable products is a promising solution to this problem. The selective production of a single chemical instead of a mixture remains a great obstacle to the adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, Dr. Matthias Waegele is seeking to understand how the physical and chemical properties control the product selectivity of electrocatalytic processes. The insights derived from this project are critical for the design of carbon dioxide conversion processes with high product selectivity.

To establish robust interfacial property/reactivity relationships, his research team is characterizing the electrocatalytic interface by surface-selective infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies while simultaneously monitoring the reaction products evolving from the same interface by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Specifically, Dr. Waegele and co-workers are elucidating how cations, co-adsorbates, interfacial water, and the coverage, site-distribution, and dynamics of surface-adsorbed CO (a key intermediate in carbon dioxide reduction) affect interfacial properties and thereby impact catalytic selectivity.

This project is useful in understanding and evaluating the implications of the rapidly growing information technology and its use to guide our every day decisions. The developed framework also advances the knowledge on how internet platforms may collect data from individuals and use them to recommend products or to make hiring decisions. The second project looks at school applications by students and considers that students make mistakes in these applications. These mistakes in turn affect forecasting reforms in the application procedures. The third and fourth projects are theoretical tools that will be useful for researchers that work in related areas. <br/> <br/>The first project develops a conceptual framework for understanding data-driven recommendations that increasingly guide our every-day decisions by considering the feedback mechanism between the recommendations and our decisions. Understanding this feedback process identifies the nature of externalities and potential inefficiencies, leading to deeper understanding and possible policy implications about the new markets guided by data-driven recommendations. The research also addresses the concern that the increasing reliance by employers on third-party algorithms to screen job candidates may adversely affect inclusion in employment. The second project advances mechanism design in school choice by considering that students make mistakes in applications and uses this framework for school matching based on rankings and lottery.

Much of the current knowledge in this area has been obtained from numerical simulations of idealized configurations using relatively simple chemical models. To address the need for greater realism, this project will use advanced computational tools and more sophisticated chemical modeling to study the characteristics and behaviors of highly turbulent premixed flames in practically relevant configurations. Ultimately, physical insights resulting from this project will enable more accurate simulations of advanced energy systems. Complementary to the research goals of this project, a new summer workshop on computational fluid dynamics will be established for under-represented minority students. The goal of this workshop is to give the next generation of scientists and engineers, from all backgrounds, experience in modeling real-world energy systems. These students will improve their understanding of the engineering design process as well as become aware of the environmental and engineering issues related to the continued use of combustion for energy generation.<br/><br/>This research will make use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for overcoming the computational cost of simulating more complex practical configurations, including those where secondary flows, shear, swirl, and walls are important. Using AMR, new direct numerical simulations will be performed, and the resulting datasets will be examined using Lagrangian and scale-dependent diagnostics to address three fundamental questions: (i) How does high intensity turbulence affect premixed flame structure, dynamics, and chemical pathways? (ii) How are turbulence structure and kinetic energy dynamics affected by premixed flames? (iii) How do flame properties depend on configuration and operating conditions? The configurations examined will include bluff-body stabilized flames, interacting jet and Bunsen flames, and swirling multi-nozzle combustors. Each of the simulations will be performed in close collaboration with experimentalists, allowing validation of all results. In addition to refining theories and models of highly turbulent combustion, the proposed project will impact the broader combustion community by publicly sharing data and statistics from each of the simulations, as well as all analysis codes and diagnostic tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the finding that specific diseases vary in prevalence across populations has given rise to questions and concerns that extend beyond the biological.  These are such questions as, Will diagnosis become the impetus for discrimination in the funding of research or the availability of treatment? Could an association between diseases and sub-populations become a tool for political organizing or social and cultural differentiation? The anthropological research supported by this award will investigate these issues through a focus on sickle cell disease, a group of blood disorders that affects the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Sickle cell is the most common genetic disease worldwide and affects as many as 100,000 Americans. Because sickle cell is also uneven in its distribution, it is an appropriate domain for investigating concerns about changing understandings of the relationship between genes and social life. Genetic diseases increasingly dominate the landscape of biomedicine worldwide, and this project will help to understand the socio-political implications of these shifts. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted by Cornell University anthropology doctoral student, Rebekah Ciribassi, with guidance from Dr. Stacey Langwick. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in Tanzania, because it has one of the world's highest rates of children born with sickle cell disease. Because sickle cell in Tanzania is at the center of a growing network of infrastructure, advocacy, research, and care, including widespread testing, the disease is discussed widely in the public forum, which will make any socio-political relationships easier to uncover and track over time than would be the case where the disease is less common or less talked about. The researcher has identified two areas of the country, Mwanza and Zanzibar, where people are grappling with sickle cell disease but where the political, racial, and social histories through which they make sense of an inherited disease are very different. This funding is for the second phase of the research, the component to be carried out in Zanzibar. The investigators will gather data from (1) medical practitioners who work in sickle cell disease care in a hospital setting; (2) sickle cell advocacy group participants; and (3) diagnosed families. She will employ a mix-method social science approach including: archival and discourse analysis; participant observation in hospital clinics; and interviews and life history interviews with diagnosed families. The investigators will build a comparison between the data collected in the Zanzibari context and the data collected in Mwanza, with special  attention to emergent themes around blood; kinship (e.g., inheritance and reproduction); race and ethnicity; and nation. The resulting analysis will assess how genetic medicine integrates with extra-clinical contexts. The results of this research will offer an important contribution to literature on the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of genetic medicine.

Researchers will analyze the archaeological remains of shell bead manufacturing centers New Jersey between 1750 and 1900 CE. At these sites, Euro-Americans produced shell beads for export to Native American consumers on the Great Plains. How did interactions on the borders of an expanding American state impact industrialization in New Jersey? What factors led to the successes and failures of making and selling products to indigenous consumers? And how did Native consumers use Jersey-made beads to achieve their own social and political goals? Today, much of the American manufacturing sector relies on the tastes of consumers who live outside the country's boundaries. The forces that drive industry - and the success or struggles of workers - are often tied to distant political and cultural factors beyond the immediate understanding of producers. By investigating the effects of state policies on the fortunes of both early American industrialists and Native nations, this research offers key insights into the relationship between the economy, state policy, and international affairs. The archaeological excavations conducted by this project will provide opportunities for student training in scientific methods of archaeology. Researchers will engage publically with community stakeholders through local historical societies and the New Jersey State Museum in an effort to show how a local American industry was intimately tied to indigenous cultures, economies, and conflicts on the Great Plains.<br/><br/>Researchers will examine changes over time between production and consumption in order to determine the factors that influenced the rise and fall of an American industry. Shell beads have been made in North America for thousands of years, but by the American Revolution, Irish and Dutch settlers in northern New Jersey became the major exporters of beads for the fur trade. Combined with analysis of existing museum collections, excavations in New Jersey will target ""proto-industrial"" and ""industrial"" shell bead manufacturing sites to gather archaeological data in the form of debris, waste, bead blanks, tools, and finished beads. These will be examined along with historical accounts, factory ledgers, and fur trade records to track elements of ""industrialization"" such as efficiencies, technologies, standardization, and scale of output. Archaeological, historical, ethnographic, and portraiture data will be used to track broad regional trends in Native uses of shell beads throughout the 19th century. How were beads worn by different tribes, genders, and ages? In what contexts, and to what end?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Methane is a greenhouse gas whose impact on future climate warming will depend on emissions from both human sources and the changing natural environment. It is therefore critical to understand the baseline emission rates of natural methane sources to the atmosphere as well as their sensitivity to change. While the open ocean environment is thought to emit only minor amounts of methane to the atmosphere, concentrations and emission rates of methane increase substantially approaching coastlines. Coastal ocean methane emissions are potentially significant at the global scale but remain highly uncertain due to a lack of observations that accurately capture coastal distributions. Furthermore, the source of methane emitted from coastal surface waters is not well known, limiting our ability to predict how emissions will change in the future. This project will determine the source and global emission rate of methane from the coastal ocean to the atmosphere, and establish a framework to predict future emission rates in a warming climate. In addition to these scientific and societal impacts, this project will have strong educational impacts as it will provide undergraduate students the opportunity to experience the entire scientific process from idea conception to publication of the final results. A sequence of classes has been established by the PI at the University of Rochester to guide students through this process from an ocean science perspective. This project will serve as the focus for the next iteration of the class sequence, and participating students will be vital contributors to the research. When conducted previously, this educational outreach has empowered undergraduates to pursue their own scientific interests and has led to significant numbers of students pursuing graduate careers in the ocean sciences. This project will also support a Ph.D. student in a truly unique experience whereby she/he will have the opportunity to conduct meaningful research in both sea-going measurement as well as modeling laboratories, and thus integrate into two often disparate communities.<br/><br/>This project will be accomplished through a unique and equal combination of observational and statistical modeling work, leveraging methodologies that are well established in the PI and co-PI's laboratories to make rapid progress over the 2.5-year duration of the project. In total, surface methane concentrations in four coastal regions ""spanning three different ocean basins and subtropical to subpolar latitude ranges"" will be measured using an ultra-fast vacuum extraction method, yielding coastal data coverage that is unparalleled in previous datasets. Additionally, the radiocarbon content of surface methane will be measured to fingerprint its provenance between fossil and microbial sources, and biogeochemical data including chlorophyll, nutrient, and dissolved oxygen concentrations will be collected. Initial cruise data (year 1) will be used to train Artificial Neural Network models to predict surface methane supersaturation as a function of biogeochemical variables, and later cruises (year 2) will allow for independent model validation in regions that were not used for training. Having established the fidelity with which this model can generalize between coastal environments, it will be applied to extrapolate maps of methane supersaturation and estimate regional and global scale coastal methane emissions while quantifying their uncertainty. Overall, this work will close these gaps in our knowledge of the natural methane budget, yielding the most robust estimates to date of coastal ocean emissions and a new understanding of the mechanisms that sustain them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Globally, multilateral organizations, nation states, non-governmental organizations, and local-level kitchens support a variety of food assistance programs. The goals of these programs vary widely. Some provide livelihood opportunities, including direct cash or voucher transfers; others focus on emergency food aid or even enhancing the nutritional value of crops and processed foods. But whatever their goals, the foundations of such program are often shaky. Dependent on mixed-source funding and volunteer labor, they frequently taper off or close completely, leaving behind questions about why they arose in the first place, why they are unstable, and what the consequences of their demise might be for households and communities. The research supported by this award addresses these questions through the lens of intensive study of a network of volunteer meal provisioning establishments in a context of economic shift.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out by University of Arizona anthropology doctoral student Sarah Renkert, with supervision from sociocultural anthropologist, Dr. Maribel Alvarez. The researcher has located a site in a neighborhood of Lima, Peru, appropriate for the project because it has experienced exactly the sort of change that needs investigation: the unwinding of a formerly robust volunteer system of local-level food provisioning. This particular food system was based on communal kitchens, staffed by female volunteers who provided a government-subsidized hot meal to food insecure residents. These kitchens have been closing in recent years so the researcher has the opportunity to study the entire cycle: the system's rise; the kitchens that remain; and the effects, if any, of the changes on household wellbeing. The researcher will collect data with a combination of social science methods including participant observation; semi-structured interviews with current and former volunteers, clients, and supporting institutions; archival research on the system's history in relation to shifts in the local economy; and a household food security survey. These data will document the system's rise and development, the shift from community-level food aid programs to individual household self-provisioning, and the effects of these changes. Findings from this research will contribute to social theories of volunteerism and welfare in market-based economies, and be critical for policy makers attempting to develop effective programs for food provisioning, including in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the significant effect loneliness can have on health, there is still much that is unknown about its causes. Specifically, little is known about when social isolation will (and will not) evoke feelings of loneliness. For example, throughout the day, people typically move in and out of social isolation--perhaps an individual eats breakfast with his or her partner and then drives to work, alone. It is unclear from existing research if we should expect this person to feel any lonelier during this solitary drive than he or she felt while eating.  Identifying the situational and individual risk-factors for loneliness may have wide-ranging benefits. This project has the potential to advance national health and welfare by indicating how people can maximize the benefit of their social behavior, as well as by strengthening behavioral interventions to reduce feelings of loneliness.<br/><br/>For this project, data will be collected from approximately 700 participants sampled from a demographically diverse group of online workers. Each participant will complete a survey and multiple time diaries using a web-based platform. In the time diaries, participants will report about their daily experiences in chunks of time oriented around ""activities"" (e.g., sleeping, driving to work, eating lunch) and they will record other information regarding these blocks of time (e.g., who they were with and the emotions they experienced). This time diary will capture moments of social isolation, feelings of loneliness during such isolation, and the contextual details expected to intensify or inhibit feelings of loneliness. The importance of these contextual details will be identified via appropriate statistical analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This two-day Conference will be held in June 2019 on the campus of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, very close to New York City.  The 2019 Conference is the 5th in a series of Conferences that started in 2011, and this series is recognized as a key national and international venue for pushing the limits of scientific understanding about how bacteria interact with man-made surfaces.  Bacterial-material interactions is an important scientific subject because of the devastating impact that bacterial colonization of man-made biomedical devices, such as hip or knee implants, can have on patient outcomes.  Such infection can lead to long and painful hospital stays that can culminate in compromised function, chronic disease, or death.  This project is helping graduate research students, post-doctoral research fellows, and early-career Faculty members to attend the conference and develop their expertise and professional careers in this important emerging field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Understanding the fundamental science underlying how bacteria interact with biomaterials surfaces and how those surfaces can be modified to resist colonization is at the heart of an emerging new sub-field within Biomaterials Science and Engineering, namely, infection-resisting biomaterials.  While the idea of creating antifouling surfaces that resist bacterial colonization has been known for decades, antifouling surfaces are not useful in many key clinical applications, because their ability to resist bacterial colonization also prevents the desirable tissue interactions associated with healing.  The scientific challenge thus focuses on creating surfaces that are differentially interactive and can simultaneously promote favorable tissue-cell interactions while also inhibiting bacterial interactions.  To deeply explore this subject, the 5th Stevens Conference is focused on the scientific fundamentals addressing: (i) antimicrobials and antimicrobial action; (ii) infection models; (iii) bacterial response to a surface; and (iv) surface modification.  The Conference features fifteen invited lectures by recognized topical experts from around the world.  Significantly, the Conference also involves the perspectives of highly expert clinicians who can help keep fundamental scientific advances aligned with critical societal needs.  This project is providing partial financial support that enables graduate research students, post-doctoral research fellows, and early-career Faculty members to attend the Conference.  These young scientists and engineers consequently have the opportunity to present their own research findings, network with and learn from internationally recognized experts in the field, as well as develop their professional careers to help impact this important emerging field in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The millions of intestinal cells are held together by junction proteins that work simultaneously as a filter and as a glue. Most intestinal cell are absorptive cells, and it is assumed that cell-cell connections made by this cell type determine the overall porosity of the intestine. However, there are several other types of mostly nonabsorptive cells whose filter properties are completely unknown but may contribute significantly to intestinal porosity, and this project will elucidate the function of those cell types. Tissues made of just one intestinal cell type will be synthesized and tested to determine the unique composition and porosity of filters made by only that cell type. The project will advance the fundamental understanding of how cell differentiation and composition affect the filtering capacity of the vertebrate intestine. The results will be relevant to human health because almost all allergic, inflammatory, and infectious diseases of the intestine allow nonselective movements of materials that can lead to illness and death, but there is no information on whether these diseases uniquely or equally affect the filters made by different cell types. Results will be disseminated via scientific publications, magazine articles, and blogs in public websites. Research, mentoring, and teaching opportunities will be provided to international collaborators, a postdoctoral researcher, graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and local teachers, leveraging programs at the institution that target students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Small-intestine stem cells continuously differentiate into absorptive enterocytes as well as secretory enteroendocrine, Paneth, goblet and other cell types that form tight junctions sealing paracellular spaces. The composition and barrier properties of junctions of stem-cell and secretory-cell types are virtually unknown, as permeability can presently only be determined in epithelial sheets composed mainly of enterocytes or of nonphysiological immortalized cells. This project employs innovative techniques that not only control in vitro differentiation of stem cells to produce primary cultures called enteroids comprised mainly of one cell type, but also force dedifferentiation of mature cells to reacquire stem-cell characteristics. This remarkable technical advance enables the planned experiments that test the hypothesis that differentiation of stem cells into absorptive and secretory cells alters the expression and location of tight-junction proteins, resulting in significant, cell-type-dependent variation in paracellular permeability of macromolecules. The role of the major junctional proteins occludin, tricellulin, and zonula occludens 1 in determining cell-type-dependent paracellular composition and permeability will be examined. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students and post-doctoral trainees will participate in this project which applies a modern approach to studies that increase knowledge of how cell differentiation and nonenterocyte junctions contribute to the barrier function of vertebrate epithelia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While sexual selection is well studied in animals, its existence and evolution in plants is not well known. Understanding this process in plants can contribute to methods for crossing crops with their wild relatives, thereby allowing the transfer of useful wild traits into agricultural species. This research examines variation in chemical signals between male and female gametes (pollen and ovules) in several species in the genus Solanum, a group that includes important crop species: tomato, potato and eggplant. Chemical attraction between gametes is essential for reproduction in most plants and animals. The project will measure the effectiveness of gamete signals within and between species, identify the genetic and chemical causes of variation in signal attractiveness, and the consequences of this variation for patterns of fertilization success. These findings will generate new information about which signaling interactions are essential for fertilization, and greater understanding of why and how differences in male-female signaling interactions evolve. In addition, the project will involve graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, including women and individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>The project addresses the mechanistic basis of divergence in gamete chemoattraction, including the specific causal molecular changes, the role of this divergence in reproductive barriers (gamete isolation) between species, and the ecological and reproductive conditions that influence rates of change in the attraction signal. Preliminary research in the wild tomato group (Solanum) shows that gamete recognition occurs via an ovule-secreted chemoattractant that causes growing pollen tubes to reorient towards conspecific female gametes. Specific combinations of heterospecific gametes show significantly reduced attraction, indicating divergence between some species in this ovule-secreted (female) signal. The proposed work will: quantify the association between divergence in ovule gene expression and gamete chemoattraction within and between a group of closely related species; identify the underlying molecular loci, characterize their patterns of molecular evolution across the clade, and associate sequence changes with functional behavioral divergence in gamete attraction; and, evaluate evidence that selection in general, and sexual selection specifically, is a driver of gamete signal evolution and therefore divergence in chemoattraction between species. The research uses a combination of semi in vivo behavioral assays that manipulate the identity of interacting gametic partners, targeted transgenic markers, functional manipulation, and molecular evolutionary analysis, each of which has already been developed or applied in this experimental system. The findings will provide a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between molecular and functional divergence in gamete recognition molecules, across multiple closely related species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching theme of the research projects are nanomaterials innovation and fabrication. The projects are designed to build a sense of community among the students and the participating faculty, as well as expose the REU students broadly to research at the leading edge of nanoscale science and engineering. REU students are also offered the opportunity for training in the integration of research with education and outreach through participation in the Vanderbilt Summer Academy for high school students. Additionally, to facilitate the continued mentoring of the REU students after the research experience and enhance the probability of the student continuing in research, 'home mentors' are invited to visit Vanderbilt to participate in the capstone events. Historical data shows that following an REU summer, students have a heightened desire for graduate studies, with 88% remaining in science and engineering and 69% entering graduate school, primarily at other institutions ensuring students obtain the richest experience. Long term, the REU site contributes to building a workforce educated in and motivated towards science and engineering disciplines and specifically, interdisciplinary research in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The program places strong emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented minority groups and schools with limited research opportunities; the REU program and the VINSE faculty have collaborators at several institutions, including nearby HBCU Fisk University that are committed to helping us identify potential REU students. Furthermore, visits from home institution mentors also enables these partnerships to be strengthened and relationships with new institutions developed.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The promise of nanoscience and nanotechnology to revolutionize our lives in multiple ways has captured the imagination of scientists, the attention of the media, and the general public. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate matter systematically at the nanoscale, creating uniquely functional materials that can be inorganic, organic or biological, or a hybrid of any two or more of these. Thus, nanoscience and nanotechnology pose formidable challenges that cut across traditionally distinct disciplines; to meet these challenges, interdisciplinary training of future scientists and engineers in the broad field of nanotechnology is of paramount importance. To achieve this goal the VINSE summer REU site offers science and engineering undergraduate students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in the field of nanoscale science and engineering. VINSE faculty provide REU students with a true interdisciplinary research experience in an environment where physicists, chemists, biologists, and all engineers collaboratively solve problems and create new scientific understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The three-day workshop will be arranged thematically, with speakers covering topics in fluid-structure interactions and biological propulsion, complex fluids and active matter, and intracellular mechanics and other biological applications. Such small workshops also provide a critical means for students and postdocs to network with faculty members; the workshop will include a poster session to improve student and postdoc visibility. Information about the event can be found at: https://mcaim.math.lsa.umich.edu/event/fluids-materials-and-biology/<br/><br/>The form and function of flexible structures immersed in fluids are of great importance on a vast range of length scales, from the reduced drag on leaves which fold in the wind, to the squeezing transport of blood cells through capillaries. Theoretical and numerical analysis of fluid-structure interactions have been tremendously successful and have led to the development of now standard techniques used in all areas of applied mathematics. The field has seen a surge of activity in the last decade due to intersections with biology and soft matter. Meanwhile, the peculiar and intricate behaviors of complex fluids, those fluids which respond to deformation not only with viscous dissipation but also with shear-dependent viscosity, elasticity, anisotropy (direction-dependent response) and other effects is an exciting and active area of its own, particularly as applied to biological systems. This is a particularly vibrant area of multi-disciplinary science, requiring sophisticated mathematical understanding and novel computational techniques to push the field further towards problems of immediate interest for applications in biology, engineering, and human health services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will make important contributions to society by increasing robot energy efficiency and performance while simultaneously improving human-robot interaction compatibility and safety through the use of inherently soft actuators. Actuators are critical component of a machine or robot that are responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or components of a system. Current robotic actuators are poorly suited to wearable or human-assistive applications because they are inefficient when used in slow, variable-speed motions like moving an arm or leg. In addition, they create human safety hazards due to their stiffness and rigid motions. This research will create a new type of actuator that is inspired by human muscle tissues, which contain thousands of fibers that are selectively recruited to provide only the amount of force needed for a given task. Engineering artificial muscles to incorporate this concept of selective recruitment will allow the robot to consume less energy, therefore increasing battery life and range. It will also allow the same actuator to generate both gentle, precise motion as well as high-force, high-speed motion, depending on the task, while also incorporating soft construction and controllable stiffness. This new approach will help make assistive robotics safer, more comfortable, and more compatible with human physiology, all of which will provide more rapid and effective recovery for those suffering from debilitating injuries or disabilities. This research lends itself well to outreach opportunities to work with young people who suffer from disabilities; the outreach activities will help inspire them and show them how engineering can be used to improve their lives and the lives of those around them.<br/><br/>Improvements in actuator efficiency and performance can be made by implementing the biologically-inspired concept of orderly recruitment to create an integrated fluidic artificial muscle tissue that contains selectable actuation elements of different sizes. This tissue can dynamically adapt to changes in load by recruiting different combinations of actuators. This orderly recruitment scheme conserves energy by reducing working fluid consumption and minimizing throttling losses. It also allows for a wide gamut of force generation and fast response time due to reduced flow rate demand. The goals of this research are to (1) understand the relationships between recruitment state, pressure, force, contraction, and velocity for selective-recruitment fluidic artificial muscle tissues; (2) establish the effects of topology on performance and create a framework for optimizing tissues to robot operating tasks and requirements; (3) understand implications of recruitment control architecture; and (4) demonstrate bandwidth improvements, variable compliance, and energetic savings on a walking robot platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All living organisms manufacture proteins using complex molecular machines called ribosomes, the number of which is tightly regulated to meet demands.  However, not all ribosomes have the same composition and structure.  Such differences among ribosomes may influence the kind of proteins that bacteria can make at any given time.  Thus, changes in the ribosome population in response to diverse signals are likely to reshape the protein composition of the cell and its physiology.  In this project, a model bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) will be used to understand how restructuring of ribosomes influences bacterial physiology when triggered by deficiencies in zinc, an essential trace element.  A better understanding of bacterial physiology will advance what is known of their adaptability and interactions in mixed microbial communities.  Knowing how to manipulate protein synthesis, or providing new ways to do so, may significantly enhance biotechnology, ecological engineering, and sustainability.  Graduate and undergraduate students will mentor and train students one step junior to them, guiding them in ""traditional"" and advanced scientific techniques that match their proficiency with the various sub-Aims of the project.  In addition to maximizing training opportunities, this approach allows undergraduate and high school students to have role models with whom they identify.  The mentorship system will broaden participation, empowering women and other groups to pursue careers in STEM.  This project is expected to build the foundation of long-lasting research and training that will challenge the current dogmatic view of ribosome regulation. <br/><br/>Half of known bacterial strains have paralogs of ribosomal proteins.  These ""alternative ribosomal proteins"" (AltRPs) likely have a role in regulating protein synthesis.  AltRP expression is tightly linked to zinc depletion and this essential nutrient dramatically affects Msm cell morphology.  These findings support the hypothesis that zinc may control bacterial physiology by regulating AltRP expression. This CAREER project tests this hypothesis by identifying the molecular mechanisms by which zinc limitation promotes incorporation of AltRPs into ribosomes and thereby regulates ribosomal function.  Experiments will assess the extent to which AltRP-containing ribosomes, or Alt ribosomes, are distinctly localized, stabilized, activated, and/or are specific in their ability to facilitate bacterial cell growth, morphogenesis, and/or adaptation to environmental stresses.  This project will elucidate the function of Alt ribosomes and identify pathways regulated by these specialized ribosomes in Msm by employing genetic manipulation, biochemistry, advanced microscopy, and in vitro and in vivo translation techniques, coupled with transcriptomics and proteomics analyses.  Determining that Alt ribosomes in Msm translate particular mRNAs or localize in parts of the cell distinct from those primary ribosomes will define a new level of regulation for bacterial protein expression not previously recognized.  Like Msm, other bacteria and eukaryotes also have paralogs of ribosomal proteins.  Revealing novel mechanisms of ribosome regulation and the role of zinc in cell growth and morphogenesis in Msm will profoundly impact molecular biology, and provide insight into how other cell types respond and adapt to environmental stresses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ITEST seeks to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To be globally competitive, the US must optimize the available workforce to include women in STEM. There are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed in engaging women in engineering: motivation and preparedness to pursue STEM careers. The Academy of Natural Sciences will partner with Drexel University: College of Engineering and School of Education, and local engineering professionals, through the Engineering WINS (EngWINS) program. EngWINS will develop the capabilities of working engineers and faculty to serve as mentors in a new initiative to develop interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering careers among urban high school women. The project's immediate impacts extend from an out-of-school learning environment and into urban academic and industrial research centers. The workforce development would be fueled by: 1) diversifying the STEM pipeline, 2) supporting the advancement of all women in STEM fields, and 3) studying the impacts of EngWINS training among adult mentors. The project findings will have relevance for human resource practices in higher education and industry and will be disseminated among educators in engineering in both academic and out of school settings. <br/><br/>Project research will investigate how and to what extent a largely homogeneous group of working engineers can enter mentoring relationships that increase participation in their field by underrepresented populations. The project goals, scope, methods, and approaches will address the following questions: To what extent does training in culturally responsive pedagogies and anti-discriminatory frameworks shift adult mentors, mindsets, and dispositions toward their work with EngWINS students, as well as in other teaching contexts or workplace interactions with women and minorities?  To what extent do pairings of mentors and mentees from different backgrounds influence students' interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering education and careers? To what extent does interest, self-efficacy, and persistence in engineering differ between EngWINS students who have a mentor versus. those who only experience the regular EngWINS curriculum?  The projects will use mixed-methods and quasi-experimental design. There will be multiple data sources such as classroom observations, interviews, and surveys/assessments to measure student and mentor outcomes. The project will enroll adult mentor candidates into a full year of professional development training in culturally relevant pedagogies, ways to combat stereotype barriers, and implicit biases, prior to entering mentoring relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chiral molecules exist in specific configurations known as enantiomers.  Each configuration has the same atoms, but arranged spatial in a different order, this results in different chemical properties. The goal of this project is to design and optimize novel catalysts to yield specific enantiomers.  It is often important to select one specific enantiomer because the other is ineffective or harmful. New synthetic methods developed in this research may have applications in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials chemistry. An integral part of this program is to recruit and prepare a diverse STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce to advance the frontiers of science. This project provides students with opportunities for industrial training through collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company.  Professor Ngai establishes a hands-on synthetic module to introduce organic synthesis and molecular photochemistry to high school students and a summer industrial internship program to better prepare graduate students for future careers in advanced chemical manufacturing.<br/><br/>Over half of all top-selling drugs are marketed as single enantiomers; often because the other enantiomer is ineffective or harmful. As a consequence, catalytic reactions that can readily increase the structural complexity of molecules while maintaining control of the stereochemistry of the newly formed stereocenters are of importance in drug discovery and development. Visible-light photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potentially powerful tool in organic synthesis.  This catalysis has changed the way in which chemists approach some difficult synthetic problems. Precise stereocontrol of photocatalytic reactions remains a significant challenge. This research focuses on the design and development of chiral Lewis acid catalysts which enable stereoselective, visible-light mediated photoredox catalysis. These new catalysts are applied to enantioselective cross-coupling reactions of carbonyl and iminyl derivatives with alkenes. This project generates a library of novel tridentate chiral ligands and chiral catalysts that guide the development of asymmetric chemical transformations. The hands-on organic synthesis activities developed by Professor Ngai enrich the educational experience of high school students and encourage them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. These activities also provide training opportunities to pre-service chemistry teachers for their professional development. An established industrial collaboration and a summer internship program for graduate students at Boehringer Ingelheim further support career development in advanced chemical manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such rapid changes to the labor market underscore the importance of considering innovative programs that provide financial protection to displaced workers. Wage insurance is one approach that provides both compensation for job loss and incentives to return to work. As part of the Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance program, displaced workers receive up to half of the difference in wages between their old job and their new job for up to two years. The project examines how this policy influences labor market outcomes. The research specifically focuses on the amount of time people remain unemployed and their wages upon returning to work. The research, thus, is useful in exploring wage insurance as a potential alternative to standard unemployment insurance systems.<br/> <br/> <br/>Under Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), workers over age 50 who lose their job to import competition can receive up to half of the difference in their pre-displacement and post-displacement earnings (""wage insurance""). The research uses a regression-discontinuity (RD) design based on eligibility age to estimate the causal effect of this program on labor market outcomes. Merging administrative data on trade-displaced workers with nationally representative employer-employee linked data, the project looks at the long-run effects of wage insurance on re-employment wages, unemployment durations, wage growth, and occupational quality over time at the national level. The RD estimates are used in connection with a sufficient-statistics framework to evaluate welfare effects. Workers receiving wage insurance payments may smooth consumption while accumulating human capital in a new industry or occupation. The program may, however, generate moral hazard by incentivizing workers to take lower-paying, less demanding jobs, because part of their lost wages are covered by insurance. The model quantifies the magnitude of these two effects. The project advances our understanding of wage insurance as an alternative to unemployment insurance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this aim, the University of Providence will develop or strengthen partnerships with nearby colleges and high schools that serve rural and Native American communities.  This partnership will develop strategies to increase access to and interest in the University's STEM teacher preparation program, a necessary step in increasing the number of STEM majors who pursue teaching careers. To address the needs of rural Montana, the project also intends to modify the University's STEM curricula to enhance distance learning opportunities for rural students and to include Native American cultural competencies.  The approaches used in this project may serve as a model for how to address teacher shortages in rural areas. <br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to develop evidence-based, innovative strategies for recruiting, preparing, and supporting new STEM teachers, especially from rural and Native American populations.  It also aims to establish the necessary infrastructure for implementing a future Noyce Track 1 Scholarships and Stipends project.  To accomplish these goals, the University of Providence will partner with high-need, local education agencies (Great Falls High School, Heart Butte Public Schools, Browning Public Schools, and Box Elder Public Schools) as well as with nearby institutions of higher education (Stone Child Community College, Blackfeet Community College, Flathead Valley Community College, Aaniih Nakoda College, Fort Peck Community College, and Great Falls College-Montana State University).  The partnership will develop strategies to recruit STEM majors from the partner institutions into the University of Providence's STEM teacher education program, and to increase the breadth of education and cultural opportunities available to these students.  The project will also modify the University of Providence's STEM curricula to include Native American cultural competencies. In the short term, this Capacity Building project will strengthen relationships between regional colleges and high-need school districts, develop innovative distance learning programs in STEM and STEM education, and increase access to STEM education for rural and Native American populations. Over a longer term, this project has the potential to: (1) provide paths to sustainable employment for teachers in economically disadvantaged populations; (2) improve the education system by increasing the cultural competence of STEM high school teachers; and (3) increase the number of Native Americans who pursue STEM careers, thereby increasing STEM workforce diversity.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.  It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in climate, weather, and species interactions can cause variation in the direction and strength of natural selection. Differences in selection across space cause local adaptation. However, whether seasonal, yearly or longer-term fluctuations in selection are equally important for evolution is unknown. Selection that varies over time can cause rapid evolution. It can also erode or maintain variation for individual traits or genes, but may or may not be an important factor in evolutionary dynamics more broadly. Studies of genome-wide variation in natural populations are needed to fill this knowledge gap. In this project, scientists will use computer simulations, experiments, and genome sequencing of butterflies to understand fluctuating selection. The research will focus on how variation in precipitation, temperature, and other factors causes selection on caterpillars to change across space and time. Importantly, new methods will also be developed. These methods will help other scientists investigate the consequences of natural selection on ecological time scales. The project will include undergraduate research opportunities and a citizen science program. <br/><br/>The research uses samples of butterflies (>7500 specimens) collected over many decades and a combination of scientific approaches to advance understanding of fluctuating selection. Furthermore, the combination of approaches will include newly developed analytical tools. This integrative framework will allow the researcher to test neutral vs. selectionist theories of molecular evolution. One key outcome will be more refined predictions for the genomic consequences of fluctuating selection. This includes new methods and software for detecting fluctuating selection. A second outcome will be a series of empirical tests of fluctuating selection using populations of butterflies sampled multiple times since the late 1800s. These tests will focus on understanding the prevalence and causes of fluctuating selection. They will also explore the targets and consequences of fluctuating selection.

This research provides comparisons of tariffs and non-tariff barriers against pollution emissions. The research also investigates explanations for these patterns, including the potential importance of an industry's upstream location (i.e., the extent to which it sells output to other firms as intermediate goods rather than to final consumers).

These ice sheets blocked movements of plants and animals between Asia and the Americas for many thousands of years. Many species died out and others were forced into isolated, ice-free areas (refugia) north and south of the ice sheets. Today?s plants and animals carry the genetic legacy of the Ice Age and this refugial isolation, but it is not completely known how it impacted and shaped the past trajectory of many species and their movements following the retreat of the ice sheets. Yet, such knowledge is important for understanding how plants and animals may respond in the future due to environmental changes. The exact extent and timing of ice coverage is also poorly known, and islands along the northwestern coast of North America are hypothesized to have escaped Ice Age glaciation. This means they could have acted as a unique bottleneck for the passage of plants and animals in the geologic past, and even perhaps that they were an early gateway for the peopling of the Americas. This research is aimed at improving knowledge of a critical region for plant, animal, and even human migration: Southeast Alaska. We are testing the hypothesis that coastal areas in Southeast Alaska escaped ice cover by collecting rock samples that will tell us whether or not landscapes were covered by ice and when they became ice-free. We are studying the DNA preserved in fossil bones from mammals that died thousands of years ago. This research project is providing much needed insights into the history of iconic mammals and their environmental conditions in Southeast Alaska.<br/><br/>The westernmost extent and timing of ice cover along the North Pacific Coast during the Last Glacial Maximum is poorly known, leaving unanswered fundamental questions about the impact of climatic change on biotic diversification and postglacial colonization of the Americas. Various lines of evidence point to the existence of a viable, ice-free coastal corridor that may have played an important role for biotic exchange between the Old and New Worlds during the last Ice Age. This project is designed to be the definitive test of the hypothesis in support of coastal refugia. We are taking advantage of cutting-edge technologies in cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating and paleogenetic analyses of an unparalleled fossil collection from caves in SE Alaska to achieve two key objectives: (1) directly determine if SE Alaska provided ice-free refugia for terrestrial mammals during the LGM, and (2) constrain the extent and history of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the LGM. Whether the hypothesis is supported or not, this highly interdisciplinary project will deliver results with high impact and have important implications for many different disciplines spanning the geological, biological, paleontological, and archeological sciences. The results will answer a broad range of key questions about the dynamic glacial conditions of SE Alaska during the Ice Age, biogeographic history of mammal island populations, and the configuration and timing of an available migration corridor for the postglacial peopling of the Americas. This research will (a) provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, (b) broadly disseminate results and links to associated relevant topics, such as environmental change and human migration, through a website, and (c) organize a workshop in SE Alaska with public and K-12 outreach components to synthesize past and current research and focus on the intersection between research, natural resource management, and the impact of future climate projections on biotic systems across the archipelago.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using archival research methods, the researcher will examine how the war years were transformative in institutionalizing public-funded agricultural research that expanded the systematic study of local vernacular knowledge systems. The shift from small individual research institutions to large-scale public initiatives during the war was central to the emergence of Big Science for agriculture, which served to alleviate the impoverished wartime economy. The shift was accomplished by bringing scientists in closer contact with local farmers as scientists benefited through the study and codification of vernacular knowledge while farmers were given greater access to scientific education and improved crop varieties.  The findings of this research have potential policy implications for international development initiatives and Chinese agricultural development more specifically. With the current renewed interest in pre-1949 models of rural development by the ""New Rural Reconstruction Movement"" in China, the co-PI plans to write short articles to bring his findings to a wider audience, especially those associated with rural reform today. <br/><br/>This project seeks to bridge the gap between histories of science focused on transnational and national transformations (such as the emergence of Big Science during World War II) and micro-histories of vernacular knowledge systems. Rather than focusing solely on one of these aspects of wartime science, this research shows how the local interacted with the national and transnational: not only were non-elite actors and local knowledge systems vital to the construction of scientific knowledge and increasing agricultural production for the war, but the geopolitics of science and the hierarchies often built into research and development schemes shaped how Chinese scientists approached the process of knowledge accumulation. These transformations are vital to understanding post-war rural development and the foundations of China's subsequent Green Revolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, technological improvements such as genetic sequencing are producing increasingly large and complex datasets of such trees.  This project will develop new mathematical tools to understand and derive insights from tree-shaped data.

This research will contribute to the growing field of geometric statistics with a mathematical formulation and method of computation for bias in tree-shaped data, and two-sample tests validated on biologically realistic data. In scaling these statistical methods to meet the Big Data challenge, this research will continue to expand the field of computational geometry to piece-wise Euclidean, non-positively curved spaces.

In many areas serviced by drinking water treatment plants, chlorine is used to kill harmful microbes. However, chlorination can produce chemicals that are known human carcinogens. An innovative technology that can provide point-of-service treatment to areas without adequate drinking water supply is locally enhanced electric field treatment (LEEFT). High disinfection has been achieved by LEEFT operated at low voltages with a short treatment time of a few seconds. LEEFT has the added benefits of being relatively inexpensive, chemical-free, robust, and easy to operate. In this project, the PI will study how harmful microbes in drinking water are killed during LEEFT treatment. This work has the goal of developing LEEFT for wide-scale adoption for drinking water treatment to protect public health. The educational plan of this project focuses on training future environmental engineering leaders at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate level. This effort will be complimented by public outreach to increase awareness of water safety and better prepare the public to respond to disruptions in water supply due to unexpected natural disasters.<br/><br/>LEEFT is a physical treatment process that aims to utilize a strong electric field to disrupt cell membranes and thus inactivate pathogens in drinking water. The electrodes installed in a LEEFT device are typically modified with one-dimensional nanostructures so that the electric field is not uniform but enhanced locally near the tips of the nanostructures. This project will systematically investigate the behavior of bacteria during LEEFT with four specific objectives: i) obtaining LEEFT platforms that are suitable for mechanistic study, ii) understanding the mechanisms for bacteria inactivation during LEEFT, iii) revealing the processes for cell transportation in LEEFT devices, and iv) developing a mechanistic model of LEEFT for performance prediction. The core hypothesis is that during LEEFT, bacteria are transported to the regions with strong electric field by a combination of hydrodynamic-, electrophoretic-, and dielectrophoretic-forces, and then inactivated primarily due to irreversible electroporation. Some platforms in this project will be constructed on lab-on-a-chip devices fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies. LEEFT experiments will be performed under various conditions, e.g., electrode materials, frequency of the electric pulses, mixing conditions, and model bacteria.

Specifically, the researcher proposes to interview 30 persons with chronic pain who are over 18 and have experienced pain persistently or intermittently for at least three months prior to recruitment. She will conduct 30-60 minute phone interviews, asking open-ended questions about the pain experiences of participants including being in pain, living with pain, and communicating about pain. She will then conduct a rhetorical analysis of interview transcripts for references to quantified information, such as quantified time, quantified medicine, and quantified expenses. The researchers will also identify and analyze other potential trends in how persons with chronic pain describe rhetorical tactics when communicating about their chronic pain. Using rhetorical analysis will allow the researchers to identify persuasive or argumentative strategies or tactics in language use about chronic pain, as described by the people living with and experiencing chronic pain. The researcher will work with regional and national patient advocacy groups and national and international professional associations dedicated to pain treatment. She will develop and disseminate a list of actionable recommendations in a variety of forms, including an accessible one-page overview, invited presentations, and peer-reviewed publication in medical journals. Her overarching goal is to help both persons with chronic pain and the people who communicate with them (including health care providers, caregivers, and loved ones) understand the rhetorical tools and strategies available to persons with chronic pain to articulate their experiences, so that this enhanced understanding might mitigate instances of stigmatization. <br/><br/>This project is an ethnographic study of persons with chronic pain. Between 10% and 30% of the U.S. population lives with chronic pain, and the vast majority of this population reports suffering from undertreated pain, which is further exacerbated by the stigmatization of using drugs and living with physical disability. Given the prevalence, undertreatment, and stigmatization associated with chronic pain, this project seeks to determine whether there is a rhetorical tool or strategy available to persons with chronic pain to help articulate and legitimize their pain experiences for different audiences and stakeholders (health care providers, caregivers, etc.). Anthropologists, philosophers, and bioethicists argue that this stigmatization exists, in part, because pain experience is inherently subjective and cannot be quantitatively measured. Yet, both patients and physicians are accustomed to associating medical practice with objectivity, which is in turn associated with numerical quantification. Although quantifiable information is subject to interpretation, it is because of the overwhelming persuasiveness of quantification in medical and scientific contexts in the United States that the researchers propose to investigate whether a rhetoric of quantification can benefit chronic pain patients seeking legitimization and trust in their articulations of their pain experiences. The findings of this research can advance knowledge about the persuasiveness of quantification as a rhetorical device and further enhance understanding of how objective and subjective knowledge is created, valued, and communicated in U.S. culture, particularly in the context of human health and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical catalysts increase the speed of chemical reactions.  Catalysts are commonly used for preparing important materials such as plastics and medicines. It is desirable to make catalysts with long lives to avoid the high costs and environmental problems associated with the metallic elements that are often used. In this research,  polymers supports (""plastic backbones"") are used to recover a catalyst from a reaction so it can be re-used. Varied separation strategies are developed, depending on the polymer support. In much the same way that oil separates from water, the polymer-supported catalysts developed by Professor Hobbs and his students are ""phase-selective"" so they physically separate from the products after facilitating a chemical reaction. This green chemistry approach avoids wasteful and time-consuming purification steps. Educational aspects of this project are aimed at broadening the scope of polymer science education at SHSU through the development of new experiments for laboratory courses as well as hands-on participation in the research lab by undergraduates. Additional societal benefits include the recruitment and participation of under-represented students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) in research projects and volunteer work as math and science tutors in the Windham School District, the public-school system for those incarcerated in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDJC).<br/><br/>Professor Hobbs and his students develop new polymer-supported ligands and catalysts which are nonpolar and phase-selectively soluble. These polymer-supported catalysts are prepared using a combination of ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).  These are all techniques that offer high levels of control over polymer architecture.  Specific goals of the project target polymer-supported salen, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and N-heterocycle-based ligands and catalysts. Professor Hobbs is further preparing the first examples of phase-selective single chain nanoparticle (SCNP) and unimolecular ligand/initiator system (ULIS) supported catalysts. Because of their non-polar phase selectivity, these catalysts may be recovered and recycled under simple liquid/liquid separation conditions, thus avoiding chromatographic purifications. The ability to remove and recycle diminishes solvent waste and highlights the implications of this project as a model for green and sustainable chemistry. Broader impacts of this work include recruitment of students from under-represented groups to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, as well as promoting outreach and volunteerism aimed at individuals who are incarcerated in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDJC) System.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the United States, the food supply chain has largely been sheltered from disruptions. However, this could change in the future unless preventative actions are taken. Several risks to food supply chains in the U.S. are increasing in potential frequency and severity. Extreme weather disruptions to agricultural production, reliance on unsustainable irrigation resources, and degraded infrastructure represent future threats to food supply chains in the United States. This project seeks to (1) articulate the interdependent infrastructure networks that support the national food supply chain, (2) evaluate the exposure of the food supply chain to key risks, and (3) pinpoint vulnerabilities in the interdependent infrastructure networks that underpin the food supply chain. <br/><br/>The overarching scientific question of this research is: How resilient is the food supply chain of the United States to unsustainable water use, extreme weather, and degraded infrastructure? The supporting science questions are: What infrastructure supports the food supply chain? How exposed is the food supply chain to risk? What vulnerabilities exist in the interdependent infrastructure systems? What is the buffering capacity of irrigation to extreme weather? To address these questions, it is essential to evaluate the national food supply chain as a complex interdependent network. This is because food supply chains in the U.S. depend on an intricate web of interconnected infrastructure, such as irrigation, roads, ports and harbors, rail lines, and navigable waterways. This research will develop a framework to enable the scientific and policy communities to assess the resiliency of food supply chains. The hypothesis of this research is that there are ""hot spots"" of vulnerability to these risks in the U.S. food supply chain. Hot spots may exist that are not obvious when each infrastructure is considered in isolation. This research will provide a detailed understanding of the interdependent infrastructure networks that support national and global food security. Discovery of critical vulnerabilities in the food supply chain of the United States could be used to prioritize national infrastructure investment funds. Now is an opportune time to identify infrastructure investment priorities, as calls for investment in U.S. infrastructure systems are increasing. As part of this project, formal communication training will be incorporated into the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department curriculum to train the engineer of the future. The PI will develop and introduce a short course on science communication for engineers. This project will utilize the scientific knowledge obtained to develop an online, interactive Food Supply Chain Risk map. This visualization system will be used to engage K-12 students in a Girls Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (GAMES) camp, undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), policy makers and the media through the Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA), and the general public through farmers market demonstrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event is a forward-looking workshop and conference on the future of applied mathematics, the new areas that will impact its future and alter the face of how the discipline is viewed and taught, and how research in applied mathematics is conducted. It consists of two parts. The first part, June 17-18, is devoted to a workshop on data science and optimization. The audience of the workshop consists of junior researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) and senior researchers who are interested in expanding their toolbox of existing methods. The second part, June 19-21, 2019 follows a more traditional conference format emphasizing the use of data science in applied mathematics as well as the use of stochastic (as opposed to deterministic) modeling: each half day will begin with a plenary lecture, followed by parallel mini-symposia on specific topics. In addition, the conference will host four panel discussions on topics of broad importance to the field: (1) how can we increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and females in the field, (2) new approaches to teaching all aspects of applied mathematics, (3) the importance of applied mathematics in industry and government, and (4) future directions for the field of applied mathematics. The outcomes of these four panel discussions will be widely disseminated. Information about the event can be found at: https://depts.washington.edu/amath/amath50/index.shtml<br/><br/>Applied Mathematics is an ever-evolving field, consisting of the use of methods based in profound mathematics to applications in a large variety of fields. Traditionally, the field has been dominated by the use of models based on deterministic ordinary or partial differential equations. Two major advances are changing this approach. The first one is the advent of big data and the different mathematical tools that allow for the deduction of models not based on physical principles but deduced from observations. The second is the recognition of the role played by uncertainty and the impact it has on mathematical modeling, leading to the need for stochastic analysis tools. Our forward-looking meeting combines a workshop and a conference. The workshop is a training program for junior researchers to introduce them to the field of data analysis from the applied mathematics perspective, with an emphasis on data-based modeling and optimization. The conference focuses on more diverse themes, but with a strong emphasis on data science and stochastic modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monetary policy is enacted through operations of  central banks such as the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States. The operations of the Federal Reserve impacts bank decisions and therefore the credit markets. This research project develops a model to examine how monetary policy affects bank lending decisions.  The model looks at how the difference between lending and borrowing rates can be influenced by monetary policies, which in turn impacts borrowers and lenders differently. The main insight is that monetary policy can in general control credit spreads and inflation independently.<br/> <br/>The contribution to the frontier of economics is to integrate recent frameworks that study the implementation of monetary policy through banks, into an incomplete-markets economy.  Once we conceive that monetary policy operations can control spreads and affect inflation independently, we begin to challenge many preconceived views. For example, although some monetary policy operations are long-run neutral, others are not. It is often thought that monetary policy cannot set monetary aggregates independently from policy rates. Here, monetary aggregates and rates are independent instruments that grant independent control over spreads and inflation. The model can also rationalize several empirical regularities: the presence of a liquidity effect in monetary policy expansion and a higher elasticity for loan rates than deposit rates, to policy changes. Finally, the model highlights a trade-off between the depth of a crisis and the amount of risk-insurance ex-ante, if we think of monetary policy as a macroprudential tool.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in the properties of blood vessels -- often due to age or disease - can influence the activity of the cells that line the blood vessels (endothelial cells), which can subsequently respond and further affect the properties of the vessel. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research project will test a two-tier hypothesis to further understand this interaction. First, it is hypothesized that the fluid and solid forces work together to regulate behavior of the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel wall. These cells detect these forces, and, in response, guide blood vessel function to maintain health. Second, it is hypothesized that the biological response to force by the endothelial cells (a process called mechanobiology) occurs via the glycocalyx, which is a sugar layer that is anchored to and coats endothelial cells. This CAREER research project will address a critical gap in knowledge about how these vascular lining cells respond to their mechanical environment, a knowledge gap which has limited the success of vascular disease prevention and treatment. New knowledge will make it possible to engineer innovative approaches to control endothelial cell mechanobiology and transform how we repair or regenerate endothelial cell function in blood vessels. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and outreach activities will be integrated with the research in a manner that will positively impact both mechanobiology research and the STEM workforce. General and underrepresented minority populations of K -12, undergraduate, masters, and doctoral students will be engaged and trained through experiential learning activities -- ranging from hands on challenges for K-3 students to science fair projects to dissertations -- which will be catalyzed by the CAREER research project. The principal investigator will serve as an underrepresented minority coach, and opportunities will also be provided for older students to mentor younger students. This goal of the educational portion of this project is to, in the near future, expand STEM education at all levels and, in the long-term future, expand the diversity of the STEM workforce to enhance innovation.<br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to define the endothelial cell and glycocalyx mechanisms of blood vessel regulation through mechanobiology.  Three objectives have been established.  First, to characterize the architecture of the glycocalyx over a range of combined fluid-solid mechanical stimuli.  Second, to link the mechanically-controlled architecture of the glycocalyx to the activation of both protagonist and antagonist molecular mechanisms that drive the response of endothelial cells.  And finally, to clarify the extent to which cooperative mechanical, glycocalyx, and molecular stimuli evoke a response within the endothelial cells that impacts blood vessel function.  The overall educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to coach and champion culturally diverse students to broaden the future workforce, leverage new perspectives, and enhance endothelial cell mechanobiology research innovation.  This will be approached by building an inclusive STEM community that includes research experiences, mentoring, and financial support for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students -- with special emphasis on students from underrepresented groups -- who then reach back to K-8 students to excite them about STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish these goals, graduate and undergraduate students are carrying out the synthetic, mechanistic, and computational aspects of this project. This is enriching interdisciplinary research training in the state of Mississippi. This research introduces two educational strategies to recruit and retain underrepresented groups into STEM research. The first is a Community College Bridge Program that is supporting STEM transfer student majors in their transition to USM through an authentic research experience, professional development workshops, and peer mentoring relationships. The second mechanism is a computational chemistry mini-course with a focus on catalysis utilizing an existing NSF-funded supercomputing facility at USM. <br/><br/>The formation of carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds with bifunctional hydrogen bond donor and acceptor organocatalysts has emerged as a viable alternative to transition metal catalysis. A key benefit to these organocatalysts is the exploitation of the innate reactivity of existing functional groups. This research investigates the ensemble of noncovalent interactions between a catalyst and substrate by combining chemical synthesis and computational quantum chemistry. The goal of this research is a deeper fundamental understanding of small molecule catalophore design mimicking those found in biological systems. Specifically, the systematic investigation of aromatic pi-pi stabilizing interactions between the catalyst and substrate is pursued using density functional theory to parameterize and rank the importance of these subtle non-covalent interactions. The specific aims probe underexplored bond transformations such as: (i) a transition metal-free asymmetric allylic alkylation, (ii) the generation of chiral, acyclic ethers, and (iii) the formation of ambiphilic methine nucleophiles and their addition to pi-bonds. The integrated educational and research components serve to train a diverse STEM workforce of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students within the Gulf South region with a focus on those students traditionally not exposed to research including community college students.

Helium is an element highly enriched in magma, thus it can be easily detected as magmatic isotope signal in the hot spring water. The magmatic helium signal appears to respond to eruption cycles at some volcanos, but the association between its variation and observed volcanic activities is often indecisive, making it difficult to use as an eruption forecasting tool. In those studies, the temporal variations of the volcanic signals from hot springs were compared with the volcanic activities of time that the samples were collected. However, the volcanic signal may travel for substantial time period underground before seeping from the springs so that the volcanic signature we detect could reflect the magmatic activity of tens of years ago. In order to evaluate the time scale of the possible delay, the proposed project will determine the travel time of the shallow subsurface fluids that carry the magmatic helium signals using radioisotopes of Kr and Ar. <br/><br/>Ontake and Unzen volcanos, Japan, were selected as candidate sites because of their relatively recent volcanic activities and abundant helium monitoring records. Radioisotopes of Kr and Ar will be analyzed by Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) at Argonne National Laboratory and by low level decay counting at University of Bern. The chronological information will be used for re-interpreting the relationship between local geotectonic activities and He isotope records as well as for assessing the possibility of recovering 'fossil' magmatic signatures. This is the first application of these novel tools to a volcanic aquifer system. This work will provide fundamental knowledge to evaluate the feasibility of forecasting volcanic eruptions using geochemical tracers including helium.

Three principal questions are addressed: (1) How do law enforcement departments decide whom to hire? (2) How are law enforcement officers trained to use force? (3) What do the recruitment strategies and training practices reveal about how law enforcement departments conceptualize demographic characteristics and force?  Recruitment and training are understudied components of the use of force by law enforcement personnel.  By focusing on recruitment and training, this study will increase scholarly understanding of their importance in explaining the critical behavior of organizational personnel.  It will help scholars, law enforcement departments, and other stakeholders better understand how organizational change may occur.  Its findings also will provide important insights into the development of new approaches to recruitment and training.  <br/><br/>Recruitment and training in law enforcement departments are researched in this project using the methods of ethnography and interviews.  The ethnographic activities include attendance at recruiting and hiring events, observation of classroom instruction, and participation in training activities including scenario-based training.  The 40 interviewees include recruits in training, personnel in training units, personnel in recruiting and hiring units, and law enforcement personnel engaged in regular duties.  Interviews follow a semi-structured format, in which the interviewees are asked open-ended questions about their background, their career decision, the hiring and training process, and their opinions concerning the use of force and related issues.  Analysis and comparison of the responses, combined with the ethnographic observation, allow the development of theoretical insight into the effects of recruitment and training on subsequent use of force.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems are called 'unsupervised' because no human-provided information about the data is available to guide the machine learning process. Arguably the two most important unsupervised machine learning tools are dimensionality-reduction and clustering. In dimensionality-reduction, the algorithm seeks a simple low-dimensional structure that captures the interesting behavior in the data. In clustering, the algorithm seeks to group data points together into meaningful clusters. As increasingly higher-dimensional data are collected about progressively more elaborate physical, biological, and social phenomena, algorithms that aim at both dimensionality reduction and clustering are often highly applicable. However, joint formulations in the literature are often ad-hoc and fundamentally unable to operate on real data that have missing elements, corruptions, and heterogeneity --- critical machine learning challenges for modern data problems. This research project is expected to have broad applicability in data science, and will be demonstrated in two applications: genetics and computer vision. <br/><br/>The joint clustering and dimensionality reduction formulation used in this project, called K-set clustering, seeks K ""central sets"" constrained to have some low-dimensional representation, each of which represents one of K clusters in the data. The formulation is  a generalization of K-means, K-subspaces, and principal component analysis, and it naturally leads to several novel problem instances. Given a defined set geometry, the corresponding problem instance is approached from two perspectives: understanding the geometry of that instance of the problem formulation, and learning those geometric models from data. Three specific examples of the problem formulation will be studied: subspace clustering, variety clustering, and polyhedral set clustering. While each example presents intrinsic and unique challenges, these are just examples of a larger paradigm that is limited only by one's ability to define sets amenable to modeling the geometric structure in data. The formulation allows for interpretable data analysis, with a framework that can readily incorporate missing data and heterogeneous data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multi-agent Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are poised for impact in society as self-driving cars, delivery drones, and disaster response robots. The results from this project will lead to improved mission intelligence for robotic platforms with significance across many areas: from Search and Rescue (SAR) tasks, to CubeSats and space exploration.

A core enabling capability for these systems is secure, robust, contextual awareness and coordination. Agents must know their state, others' states, and how best to use this information to coordinate and complete mission-level goals. However, while this need is universal, the CPS themselves are not. Thus, there exist technological barriers to obtaining this critical information across heterogeneous platforms. An algorithmic and mathematical framework will be explored to 1) combine communication and mobility control of CPS agents to enable communication-as-a-sensor that unlocks a new understanding of interactions with the world and 2) capture the impact of this information on reliability, robustness, and security of multi-agent tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While households are free to migrate away from declining areas, towards prospering ones, many reasons mitigate mobility, leaving residents exposed to local economic conditions. This CAREER agenda proposes a line of projects to examine the causes and consequences of limited mobility, how it varies across the income levels, and ultimately contributes to well-being or inequality. The first line of research will focus on the consumption patterns across US cities and income levels. The second line will investigate the benefits of living nearby one's family members. The third line of work will look at the consequences of financial instability and housing foreclosure on homeowners, renters, and landlords.<br/><br/><br/>To investigate the geography of consumption inequality, the investigator will use a new dataset of linked bank account and credit card micro data covering 5 percent of the US. This analysis will shed light on whether consumption bundles vary mostly based on one's income or whether one's place of residence influences one's consumption bundle. The second line of work will shed light on why low skill workers appear less willing to migrate between cities. A likely mechanism contributing to limited migration is low skill workers' desire to live near their families. While geographic proximity to one's family may be beneficial in many ways, the research will investigate its labor market value using administrative data. The third line of work will analyze the costs and consequences of losing access to one's home and neighborhood through foreclosure. The project will separately study impacts on homeowner occupants, renters, and landlords to decompose the financial versus eviction effects of foreclosure. Heterogeneity in the impacts of foreclosure across high and low-income neighborhoods will provide additional evidence on whether foreclosure is a regressive or progressive policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the case of radiation therapy, which is the focus of this project, hypoxia (very low levels of oxygen) is an important cause of radiation resistance or treatment failure. Recent evidence suggests that tumors experiencing brief episodes of hypoxia can also harbor radiation-resistant cancer cells. Of specific interest are cancer cells that are situated close to the oxygen diffusion limit in tumors, a region that experiences fluctuations in oxygen availability due to poorly developed vasculature. It is not known if metabolic adaptations (adaptations to decrease energy expenditure) of these cancer cells to fluctuations in oxygen delivery can help promote radiation resistance. The research goal of this project is to develop a multimodal imaging platform to investigate the relationship between microvascular oxygenation and cellular metabolism, and how this relationship helps promote treatment resistance. Knowledge of these relationships in response to radiation therapy can lead to the development of targeted therapeutics to reverse resistance. These studies will provide opportunities for students to gain valuable research experience in design and development of optical imaging technologies and basic science investigations of cancer biology. The educational and outreach goal of this proposal is to develop year-long learning kits based on light and optics, which is part of the middle school curriculum. The purpose of these kits is to equip rural middle school teachers with active teaching modules to better communicate optics and light-based concepts to students.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term career goal is to develop optical imaging technologies that can visualize and answer basic biological questions about the tumor micro-environment that would optimally lead to the development of new biomarkers that can spur the development of cost-effective tools to help advance public health.  Towards this goal, this project will build and validate a label-free multimodal imaging platform (a two-photon microscope integrated with a hyperspectral darkfield microscope (TP-HDMI)) to quantitatively visualize the relationship between microvascular oxygenation and cellular metabolism and determine how the relationship between these two hallmarks promotes radiation resistance.  Hyperspectral microscopy will be used to assess oxygenation levels based on light absorption by hemoglobin and the differences in absorption profiles of oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (dHb) hemoglobin.  The oxygenation level metric for spatial comparison will be [HbO2]/([HbO2]+[dHb]). Two-photon microscopy will be used to assess cellular metabolism based on the system's ability to image natural fluorescing NADH and FAD, molecules that are critical for the energy producing processes.  The cellular metabolism metric for spatial comparison will be the optical redox ratio FAD/(FAD + NADH). The transformative nature of the project lies in the ability to investigate dynamic changes in the spatiotemporal relationship between tumor oxygenation and cellular metabolism in vivo in response to radiation therapy, and how these changes might be distinct in radiation-resistant and sensitive tumors. The central hypothesis of this work is that metabolic reprogramming under these intermittently hypoxic conditions can cause cells to develop a radiation-resistant phenotype. The Research Plan is organized under two objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to build the multimodal system and to validate its ability to investigate spatiotemporal relationships between vascular oxygenation and cellular metabolism. Once assembled, the integrated imaging platform will be validated in normal tissue within a window chamber model established in athymic nude mice.  Image analysis algorithms will be used to separate vascular and non-vascular tissue.  Dynamic metabolic responses to changes in oxygen supply will be imaged while the mice are subjected to varying levels of hypoxia.  The optical redox ratio as a function of distance from the nearest blood vessel will be determined.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in tumor bioenergetics in radiation-resistant and sensitive tumors in response to radiation therapy.  The integrated imaging platform will be used to investigate dynamic spatiotemporal changes in cellular metabolism in response to different doses of radiation therapy in human head and neck tumors of known radiation resistance and sensitivity implanted in the mouse window chambers.  All of the imaging-related endpoints will be further validated using immunohistochemical assays.  The studies will establish a model for metabolic changes within cancer cells as a function of microvascular oxygenation, distance from the nearest microvessel, and time after radiation therapy.  Results obtained are expected to significantly expand our understanding of how the spatial location of cells with respect to the oxygen diffusion limit influences their resistance to treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pain medicine is a common treatment for chronic low back pain patients and often results in addiction, which is a huge problem in the United States. This problem can be reduced by creating treatments that target pain directly at its source and thus reduce the need for the systemic pain medicines.  Chronic low back pain can arise from the discs in the spine. Nerves can grow into these discs and be a source of pain. The hypothesis of this project is that local delivery of treatments can reduce low back pain by causing existing nerves to retract and by preventing re-growth of new nerves. As such, the research goal of this project is to understand undesired nerve growth and to engineer treatments for local delivery to prevent and reverse nerve growth. The project will identify and test compounds that cause retraction of and prevent regrowth of nerve fibers. In parallel with the research goal, the major education goal is to present this new back pain research to both scientific and public audiences and to train students to communicate with varied audiences. Therefore, this project will train students and peer faculty in the communication of science and educate the local community over the age of 50 about low back pain. Taken together, the completion of this project will provide the foundation for the principal investigator's career in low back pain research while preparing the next group of engineers and increasing knowledge among the general public about low back pain and treatments.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term career research goal is to develop novel biomaterial-based treatments for musculoskeletal pain.  Toward this goal, this project will engineer targeted biomaterials that will prevent and reverse the sprouting of painful (nociceptive) sensory nerve fibers into the previously nerve-free nucleus pulposus (NP) core of intervertebral discs (IVD), which is one of the major causes of chronic low back pain (LBP). The project's overarching hypothesis is that local delivery of therapeutic biomaterials and compounds can alleviate pain and prevent chronicity by causing existing nerves to retract or dieback and prevent re-growth of painful nerve fibers.   The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to identify and test compounds that cause dieback of undesired sensory nerve fibers and characterize mechanisms of dieback.  Studies will be performed in 3D cell cultures in which neurite extensions have been grown from trimmed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) harvested from rat pups.  Myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Resiniferatoxin (RTX), two compounds associated with dieback after spinal cord injury and in cell culture studies, will be added to the culture medium and dieback of neurite extensions will be assessed.  Studies are designed to determine ideal concentrations of MAG and RTX to cause dieback of sensory neurons in vitro, to assess cell health of DRGs and NP cells with dieback compounds and to differentially assess how MAG and/or RTX impact gene expression of pain-associated ion channels in sensory neurite subsets, and therefore downstream pain.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to develop novel materials to prevent undesired nerve growth.  Studies will be performed in 3D gel cocultures consisting of a human derived NP core surrounded by a gel containing rat derived DRGs and matrix support for the NP core.  Various compositions of microparticles containing methacrylated chondroitin sulfate A and C (MA-CS-A and MA-CS-C), which are known to be neuro-inhibitory, will be incorporated into the NP core and their ability to prevent nerve ingrowth will be assessed.  Studies are designed to develop a neurological 3D in vitro mimic of NP with tunable composition for long term culture of NP cells and DRGs, to determine CS concentration and type effects on DRG growth in vitro, to verify mechanism of inhibition and to fabricate microparticles for injectable delivery of neuro-inhibitors, enabling in vivo delivery.  The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to test efficacy of identified materials and compounds to prevent and reverse LBP in an animal model.  Studies will be performed in a rat lumber disc puncture model that has been used extensively as a model of disc degeneration.  Ten weeks after puncture, animals will be divided into 5 treatment groups depending on results obtained in objectives 1 and 2:  MAG or RTX dieback compounds, MA-CS-A or MA-CS-C microparticles, dieback compound and microparticles, type I collagen control or sham surgical control.  The degree and resolution of pain will be assessed using a novel rodent gait analysis.

While prediction and control of local microstructures, enabling the control of local material properties, has the potential to realize complex functionalities within monolithic structures, it is not yet fully realized in metal additive processes. Achieving this capability is seen as an important step in realizing components, via a single manufacturing process, that can mimic advantageous bioinspired structures such as a mantis shrimp claw which combines a very hard outer surface with a tough core to give excellent fracture resistance. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award seeks to address this knowledge gap by understanding how additive manufacturing process parameters drive changes in pivotal microstructure characteristics, and hence the final properties, of printed nickel-titanium shape memory alloys. Being able to predict and control location-specific material properties will greatly extend current additive manufacturing capabilities giving further competitive advantage to US manufacturers involved in the production of high end components for aerospace and biomedical industries. This award will also provide opportunities for future manufacturing workforce development through activities such as; 1) internships for graduate students at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 2) study abroad programs, 3) an outreach program for K-12 teachers, and 4) incorporation of a course on additive manufacturing into a larger certificate program aimed at the advanced manufacturing workforce in Texas. <br/><br/>The research objective is to enable the fabrication of metallic structures with location-specific properties using laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes. The focus of the research is on how the phase transformation temperature of nickel-titanium alloys varies with processing conditions. Preliminary work suggests that there are three significant factors affecting the transformation temperature; (1) the volume fraction of precipitates, (2) the dislocation density within the material, and (3) the nickel evaporation loss during processing. Experimental tests and subsequent characterization will deconvolve the effects of these factors. Most importantly the results will be considered with respect to the processing conditions and will provide insights on how process parameters such as hatch spacing and laser power influence can be selected to control the microstructure. Nickel-titanium is selected as a proxy for other materials in which microstructural and/or composition changes greatly affect material properties, due to its sensitivity to these changes. It is expected that the knowledge generated in this CAREER research will serve as foundational knowledge to realize location-specific property control in other material systems processed using metal additive manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In regions with high seismic activity, such as California, there are dense networks with one seismic sensor every 10 to 30 km. However, past large earthquakes taught us that this station density is still not enough. Earthquake shaking can change dramatically from block to block, due to highly complex shallow soil structures. Furthermore, many small earthquakes are not detected by the current seismic networks, smearing our images of faults. With denser seismic networks, scientists will be able to better map earthquake faults and monitor their activities, also to provide more clear pictures of Earth interior.<br/><br/>Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology that converts every meter of a long optical fiber to a seismic sensor, by shining a laser pulse into the fiber from one end and interrogating the ""echo"" scattered from fiber defects. DAS provides a scalable and affordable way to deploy a dense seismic network. This CAREER project will build the Pasadena Array, the first continuous city-scale fiber seismic network, to explore the potential of DAS in the next-generation seismic networks. The researcher will collaborate with the City of Pasadena to transform an existing telecommunication fiber network owned by the city to a seismic array with 50,000 sensors within 10km. The Pasadena Array will be a unique platform to test and characterize different generations of DAS instruments, develop data processing algorithms, and explore applications in seismology. The orders of magnitude increase in station density will push the limits of earthquake detection, basin structure imaging, and hazard assessment/mitigation. Ultimately, the Pasadena Array will serve as a template to build a million-sensor seismic network in Southern California, and transform how we design, build, and use seismic networks nationally and globally.The Broader Impacts of the project include the benefits enhanced knowledge of the impacts of earthquakes and the involvement of students in the Pasadena school system in better understanding seismic hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. <br/><br/>While we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database. The proposal team will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates will be meaningfully involved in data collection and interpretation. The team will also develop new educational activities for both high school and college-level audiences.

Biological research collections allow scientists to understand both how changes in the landscape affect species and to forecast how future changes to the landscape could affect those species. As indicators of environmental health, specimens preserved in biological research collections provide human society with a vital tool that can be applied to a diversity of issues related to human health, including studies of infectious diseases or the affect that disasters had on the environment. For example, without biological research collections, tracking the entire arc of an emerging infectious zoonotic disease (one caused by the transfer of an infectious agent from animals to humans) would be challenging if there were no animal specimens to determine the wild species that served as a reservoir for the infectious agent. Along the Gulf Coast of the United States, determining the biological effect of large oil spills on the deep-water and coastal environments would be challenging without good documentation of when and where species occurred before spills. Biological research collections are available to fill these needs through careful preservation of specimens that document when and where a species occurred. This grant supports the Collection of Genetic Resources at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, one of the oldest and largest collections of frozen tissues (e.g. heart, liver, muscle tissues) and tissue extracts (e.g. DNA) of wild vertebrates. Since its inception in 1979, the Collection has been acknowledged in more than 1500 publications and theses. The grant will allow the Collection to continue supplying the research community with the highest quality genetic materials.<br/><br/>The Collection of Genetic Resources at the LSU Museum of Natural Science houses genetic material from more than 140,000 individual wild animals representing over 8,000 species, with a rate of growth of ca. 10,000-15,000 samples per year from ca. 4,200 individuals. This collection is used by scientists working in a diversity of fields, and provides, on average, 2000 tissue subsamples to researchers around the globe each year. The Collection supplies genetic materials to the international community for research in genomics, molecular evolution, population genetics, ecology, wildlife management, forensics, epidemiology, environmental toxicology, and other areas.  Whenever possible, tissues in the Collection are flash frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen to ensure the preservation of fragile biomaterials, such as RNA and proteins, required by the dramatically expanding field of genomics. Optimally, those flash frozen tissues are transferred at LSU to liquid nitrogen vapor freezers (-196 degrees C) for long-term archiving. However, the Museum's six liquid nitrogen freezers are now full. This award provides funds to purchase two additional liquid nitrogen vapor freezers for the bird and mammal specimens, and a safer, more efficient liquid nitrogen delivery system and to provide support for a graduate assistant to transfer specimens from ultracold to the new liquid nitrogen freezers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to pave a new path beyond the current state of the art for designing and discovering functional materials by understanding the impacts of defects. Defects in materials are disruptions to the periodic order of atom arrangements and serve as a double-edged sword. On one hand, defects are critical to delivering many key properties of materials, for instance, fast ion conduction necessary for energy storage with high-energy and high-power densities, and on the other hand, they can lead to materials performance failure such as short-circuit in batteries, instability, or short lifetime. The new knowledge gained from this research activity fills the gap in fundamental understanding of defect chemistry, enables controlled creation of functional defects in technologically important materials, and allows minimization of detrimental defects for improved materials performance. The outcomes advance technologies such as energy conversion and storage, data manipulation, sensors, and actuators. Students trained within this project will typically find employment in national laboratories engaged in R&D of chemical and materials science, or high-tech industries that enable novel technologies - both pathways can enhance national competitiveness. <br/>    <br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The lack in understanding structural defects, including their nature and function, has limited the proper employment of defects to enhance materials performance or to minimize performance failures. This project aims to achieve controlled defect creation in functional materials in order to deliver new properties or significantly enhance materials performance by characterizing, understanding, and predicting defects at different time and length scales. This research combines theoretical investigation and advanced characterization (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) to examine defect formation, evolution, and their impacts on ion conduction and materials stability in 3D solid ion conductors. The insights gained will transform materials design and lead to more efficient materials discovery for technological advancement in energy storage. University students (at both the undergraduate and graduate levels) are trained in first principles calculations, materials informatics approaches, advanced materials synthesis and/or characterization. A materials chemistry seminar program in partnership with a historically black institution is established to recruit minority students. High-school internship and middle school mentorship programs at FSU are leveraged to engage K-12 students in scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ecosystems in the northwest Atlantic Shelf, including in the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight, have experienced some of the fastest decadal and 30 year warming rates in the historical record, and these strong warming trends were punctuated by marine heatwaves in 2012, 2016, and 2018.  Most studies of climate impacts in the ocean have focused on how rising temperatures affect individual species. This project focuses on the impact of warming, both short-term events and long-term trends, on the entire ecosystem. It leverages the region's recent warming and history of consistent sampling to contrast the properties of the plankton and fish communities in the colder Gulf of Maine with the warmer Mid-Atlantic Bight.  Through statistical analyses, size-based modeling, and food web modeling, this project evaluates direct and indirect influences of temperature on biological processes, community characteristics, and emergent ecosystem properties. This study characterizes composition and features of the plankton and fish communities and compares ecosystem changes across space and through time.  It also isolates the direct influence of temperature on metabolism and growth from the indirect influence of temperature through changes in the oceanography. An understanding how marine ecosystems respond to warming is essential to successfully manage these ecosystems in a changing climate. The project team is actively engaged in translating knowledge into fisheries management at a regional and national level. This project also educates the next generation of citizens and scientists by expanding the ecosystem modeling activity in the Gulf of Maine Research Institute's LabVenture program, which serves ~10,000 Maine middle school students each year. An online curriculum on modeling, a topic area in the Next Generation Science Standards that many teachers find challenging is under development. The project also supports a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student and contributes to Stony Brook University's program to encourage participation of women in the sciences.<br/><br/>Temperature affects metabolism and growth, with most species growing faster but maturing earlier and at a smaller size in warmer conditions. This project characterizes the direct influence of temperature on fish growth patterns and incorporates this knowledge into a trait-based, size-spectrum model of a fish community. This model quantifies how changes in temperature and zooplankton composition translate into changes in size structure of the fish community. Warming causes poleward movement of species such that traditionally cooler ecosystems come to resemble warmer ecosystems of the past. This project uses a dynamic food-web model to synthesize how changes in species composition have altered the flow of energy in Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight ecosystems. It also quantifies the stability of these communities and their resilience to perturbations like marine heatwaves, with the expectation that gradual warming causes communities to become more diverse and thus more stable, while abrupt warming may have the opposite effect. Both components contrast the ecosystem properties in the warmer mid Atlantic with those in the cooler Gulf of Maine as well as those properties in the past with those under the recent very warm conditions. The comparative approach also untangles the direct impact of warming on organisms from the indirect effects from vertical stratification. In particular, comparing the recent thermally stratified period with the 1990s, when reduced salinity led to an abrupt, multi trophic-level community shift, make it possible to isolate the direct effects of temperature from its influence through hydrography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interfaces often display thermal interface resistance (TIR), and for a broad range of electronic, photonic, and energy-harvesting materials, TIR can critically affect the materials' performance and stability. However, it is often very challenging to identify the exact origin of TIR, since it would require an exact understanding of 'what really happens' at the interface, including the exact structure of the interface and how the structure affects the thermal transport process. This project develops a novel technique that uses a small electron probe to directly measure the temperature at the interface with near atomic scale resolution and determine TIR with unprecedented precision. This new approach can deliver transformative impact to the thermal engineering of materials in many ways, by providing the new important understanding on how the atomic scale structure and defects at the interface affect TIR, verifying the existing theories and simulation results on how to reduce TIR, and providing new material design rules on how to control TIR by modifying the interface structure and composition. This project integrates the education and outreach activities for underrepresented students to provide them with opportunities to engage with researchers, motivate, and help them potentially pursue advanced degrees or careers in science and engineering. The project also includes the development of the interactive data analysis system that allows people with visual impairment to perceive and process scientific data using their auditory senses.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A new Debye-Waller thermometry under development is based on quantifying Debye-Waller factor, the attenuation of the scattered electron intensity due to thermal vibration, spatially resolved at the atomic scale, using high angle annular dark field signal in scanning transmission electron microscopy that is highly sensitive to thermal vibration. Using this new approach, the temperature profile at the interface at the atomic scale can be measured in situ, and TIR is directly determined from the profile with high precision, beyond the limits of any existing methods. This new experimental capability can validate the existing theories and hypotheses on how to reduce TIR, including the theories involving phonon matching, acoustic matching, epitaxial strain, and defect control. The validation is carried out using carefully designed perovskite oxide interfaces, which are synthesized using different structural parameters, such as the atomic mass, bond strength, strain, defect density, layer thickness, and interface roughness. The error analysis part of this work is assisted by the accommodation technology developed in this project, which allows people with disabilities to efficiently perceive, handle, and analyze the scientific data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although behavioral states are pervasive throughout the animal kingdom, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are poorly understood. To address this problem, the researchers examine the brain mechanisms that underlie behavioral state generation in a simple animal model, the roundworm C. elegans. Specifically, they examine how groups of interacting neurons --or neural circuits-- contribute to the generation of behavioral states. C. elegans is an attractive system for these studies because its nervous system consists of just 302 neurons. Moreover, the connections between these neurons are already known. Thus, fundamental principles of neural circuit function can be rapidly discovered in this animal and then applied to more complex animals. The specific goals of the research plan are to (1) fully characterize behavioral states in C. elegans, (2) examine how groups of neurons interact during behavioral states, and (3) use new optical approaches to characterize brain-wide activity during behavioral states. These studies will yield new insights into how animals generate behavioral states, with implications for human well-being, public policy, and more. This research plan is integrated with an educational plan centered on developing an undergraduate laboratory course where students learn and apply modern neuroscience methods to study neural circuits. The course materials will be made freely available to other educators.<br/><br/>A full understanding of neural circuit function requires detailed knowledge across many scales of analysis: from molecular events in single neurons to large-scale patterns of neural activity to emergent animal behaviors. This research project bridges these scales of analysis in the context of neuromodulatory control of long-lasting behavioral states. Although almost all animals display long-lasting behavioral states, the neural mechanisms that allow animals to generate these states are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to dissect these mechanisms in the simple nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, linking specific sites of neuromodulator release to large-scale activity patterns and behavior. Aim 1: First, a novel imaging platform will be used to determine how all C. elegans behaviors co-vary over time as animals switch between behavioral states. Aim 2: Targeted mechanistic experiments will then be used to examine how specific neuromodulators allow for state-dependent coupling between premotor circuits to coordinate behaviors as animals switch states. Aim 3: Finally, a whole-brain calcium imaging approach will be used to examine brain-wide activity patterns during behavioral states. These studies will reveal fundamental neural mechanisms that allow animals to coordinate and structure their behaviors. This research plan is complemented by an educational plan, which is centered on the development of a new undergraduate laboratory course in which students learn and apply modern neuroscience techniques to dissect neural circuit function.

The REU Site brings talented undergraduates from a nationwide pool of applicants to the UMN campus for an intensive 10-week research experience that includes extensive training and development of career-building skills. Each participant pursues an independent research project within an interdisciplinary research group. The interdisciplinary nature of the Site makes it an ideal opportunity for students in Materials Science, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and other related majors enrolled in two- or four-year academic institutions. In addition to conducting research and engaging in career development workshops, participants deliver a poster and a formal oral presentation at the program's conclusion. The RET component draws six teachers annually from the greater Twin Cities for a six-week research experience and 25 additional teachers for a three day RET-led workshop. RET participants have their own research projects, and work to develop and disseminate standards-based engineering laboratory activities for middle and high school classrooms. Teachers participate for two consecutive summers and are encouraged to apply to the program as teams (two teachers from the same school or district); participating in consecutive summers allows for revision and improvement of developed classroom activities, while participating in teams reduces institutional resistance to new materials. The REU and RET programs are continually evaluated both formally through repeated measure surveys and informally through individual interviews and group discussions in order to improve the program each year, and to inform changes during the program to meet the needs of each unique cohort. The combined elements of the REU/RET site seek to enhance K-12 education in science, engineering and technology in general, and Materials Science in particular, in order to increase interest in K-12 students while also preparing undergraduates for graduate and professional careers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The REU Site in nanomaterials is an intensive 10-week research experience that exposes undergraduates to interdisciplinary materials research. Projects available to participants address a wide range of 'hard' to 'soft' materials: Electrostatic Control of Materials; Sustainable Nanocrystal Materials; and Hierarchical Multifunctional Macromolecular Materials. Each research group integrates the six basic elements of materials science and engineering - synthesis, theory, structural characterization, property evaluation, processing, and applications - required for effective innovation in materials research and development. In addition to being assigned an independent research project, students participate in a comprehensive collection of activities designed to offer in-depth, stimulating research experiences; foster mentoring relationships with faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows; and enhance student skills in preparation for graduate school and research careers. Participants in the RET component of the Site gain hands-on laboratory experiences to help them better understand the practice of science and engineering and subsequently communicate it to their students. Teachers work with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students with distinguished track records in research and education, emphasizing a rich array of interdisciplinary research topics that are then developed into curriculum elements and laboratory activities for use in K-12 classrooms. Both the REU and RET components are designed to promote and assure inclusion of women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities in the preparation of the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing systems have trouble operating in dynamic, real-world environments that include unexpected disturbances. Thus, the goal of this CAREER project is to address the need for assistive robots that can naturally respond to disturbances by exploiting the underlying dynamics of human locomotion, i.e., by providing the device, in real time, with the same abilities to change joint stiffness and damping properties that humans unknowingly regulate through muscle activations. The key idea is to understand how the nervous system regulates leg joint stiffness and resistance throughout walking, and use this information for a new, bio-inspired blueprint for design and control of assistive robotics. This project will also provide insight into how the human body responds to disturbances. The results from this project will significantly improve quality of life and productivity for over a million lower-limb amputees in the U.S. alone. Throughout the project, the integration of research and education will have broad impact through the 1) promotion of STEM and disability awareness to K-12 students through targeted events that showcase the formal and ""maker"" sides of engineering, 2) implementation of interdisciplinary mechanisms for knowledge transfer between engineering students and clinicians, and 3) sponsorship and mentoring of student senior design projects that directly support this research through co-oversight with clinicians.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term research goal is to advance a transformative approach to the design and control of assistive robots that embrace and exploit the underlying dynamics of human locomotion. Towards this goal, this project will measure the mechanical impedance of the knee joint during walking and use the information obtained to develop a new generation of bio-inspired control systems that will enable users of assistive robots to move more freely in dynamic environments that include unexpected disturbances.  Studies will make use of assistive devices already developed or under development in the principal investigator's lab: a torque-controllable exoskeleton for the knee and an Open-Source Robotic Leg prosthesis (OSL, developed under an NSF award) that has powered knee-ankle joints.  The Research Plan is organized under three aims.   The FIRST AIM is to investigate techniques for measuring knee mechanical impedance using the torque-controllable exoskeleton, which will be quantified in able-bodied subjects during walking.  Methodologies will be validated in a passive mechanical system of springs and masses for which impedances are known before involving human subjects. Data that can be used to determine mechanical impedance of the knee during locomotion will be recorded from human subjects wearing the knee exoskeleton while walking on a split-belt treadmill in which small perturbations (e.g. increased ramp angle) can be applied and response torques measured by the exoskeleton.  Perturbations will be applied such that a snapshot of impedance can be obtained at each point during the gait cycle.  Point impedances will be quantified by fitting inertia, stiffness and damping parameters to a second-order differential equation.  The SECOND AIM is to derive governing equations for bio-inspired impedance control of the leg that will be implemented in an open-source library for control of the OSL.  The results obtained under Aim 1 will be synthesized with preliminary work estimating the impedance of the ankle to derive a unified control law that enables simultaneous regulation of knee-ankle kinetics, kinematics and mechanical impedance.  The governing equations will be translated into a software library that is able to command the OSL and enables real-time control of knee-ankle impedance, i.e., stiffness, damping and equilibrium position parameters will be altered as a function of gait phase and, thus, not predisposed to a single speed.  The ability of the OSL to achieve the desired stiffness and dampening coefficients will be validated in a benchtop testing setup.  The THIRD AIM is to understand the effect of the impedance-based control system in above-knee amputees using the OSL, tested during ambulation with/without disturbances.  Subjects will be studied while ground walking at a self-selected pace with both the impedance-controlled system and each person's prescribed prosthesis. A subsequent study will investigate the effect of disturbances while subjects are walking on an instrumented treadmill.  Kinetics, kinematics, metabolics and stability measures across conditions will be compared to better understand how the bio-inspired control approach affects amputee mobility and how these measures compare to able-body mechanics.  Though several disturbances will be applied, this project will focus on understanding the effect of walking on inclines and declines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such materials are promising for applications in molecular and energy storage, environmental remediation, as well as separation of important chemical intermediates and products. The key challenge associated with the development of porous organic frameworks is the tradeoff between high crystallinity for selective molecular adsorption and separation, and high chemical stability for long-term usage. With joint support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), this CAREER project addresses this challenge and develops a new family of highly ordered, chemically stable, and elastic porous organic materials. Through a new synthesis approach elasticity becomes a feature of porous organic frameworks, allowing them to dynamically expand their structure by breaking hydrogen bonds, and recover to their original crystalline form by reforming the temporary bonds. These elastic materials are expected to achieve high adsorption capacity and selectivity over the existing porous organic materials. Furthermore, incorporating active species into these materials enables next-generation environmental and energy-related applications to advance national prosperity. Through the integrated education and outreach activities Prof. Ke and his research group make abstract scientific concepts more accessible to students at all levels as well as the general public, and show how material science can address global problems. Specifically, this is done by (1) designing an interactive demonstration named ""Traveling Through Nano Space"" to illustrate fundamental concepts related to porous materials, (2) mentoring high-school and undergraduate students to develop an easy-to-replicate 3D printer and materials; and (3) developing an active-learning class to engage students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in their STEM education.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>With this CAREER project, jointly supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the next-generation of elastic porous organic materials are designed and synthesized. In particular, this class of materials has high crystallinity, allowing for precise structure-property analysis and endowing them with high chemical stability for applications such as chemical storage, separation and potentially catalysis. A series of hydrogen-bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF) materials are constructed through the combination of hydrogen bond directed assembly and photo-crosslinking in single crystals. The project provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-property relationship of HCOF materials by focusing on three aspects: First, the crystal structures of HCOFs and their molecular precursors can reveal atomic-level structural information that are difficult to obtain in conventional porous organic frameworks. Second, integration of flexible crosslinkers provides HCOFs with unique elasticity, which enables them to dynamically adjust their 3D architecture by breaking and reforming hydrogen bonds, thereby increasing the guest binding capacity and selectivity based on different substrate-framework interactions. Third, decreasing the degree of crosslinking in HCOFs provides a range of partially crosslinked frameworks with greater elasticity and novel nanoscale morphologies, which are not accessible using the synthetic strategies of traditional porous organic frameworks. This approach also enables HCOFs to incorporate catalytically active moieties that are not compatible with traditional organic framework materials, supporting next-generation environmental and energy-related applications. The research efforts enrich the educational and outreach activities of this project, which aim to make abstract scientific concepts more accessible to students at all levels as well as the general public. This is achieved by (1) designing an interactive demonstration named ""Traveling Through Nano Space"" to illustrate fundamental concepts related to porous materials, (2) mentoring high-school and undergraduate students to develop an easy-to-replicate 3D printer and materials; and (3) developing an active-learning class to engage students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in their STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Very recently, kirigami, the ancient paper cutting art, has inspired emerging scientific research and engineering innovations, ranging from mechanical metamaterials, stretchable devices, and solar tracking, to self-assembled 3D meso-structures. However, it largely lacks the fundamental understanding of cut-structures determined macroscopic mechanical response of kirigami structures. This research program will establish a theoretical framework for connecting the macroscopic mechanical behavior and cuts-based microstructures in a new class of kirigami-based structures, which are reconfigurable in both 2D and 3D. The knowledge developed through this project will advance multiple technologies, including scaffolds for conformable and stretchable electronics, electronic skin, adaptive energy efficient building envelope, programmable soft machines, soft robots, and reconfigurable acoustic wave guides. The education and outreach objectives will align with the research goal in generating better understanding of mechanics and structure-determined properties and functionalities in kirigami structures. Programs at Temple and museums in Philadelphia will be used to broaden the participation of K-12 in STEM, including Women's Engineering Exploration summer program and STEM education department at Temple, as well as Science museum displays (Franklin Institute) and Art show (Philadelphia Museum of Art) in Philadelphia.   <br/><br/>Kirigami-based 2D/3D structures will be constructed by applying designed cuts and/or folds to both planar sheets and bulk materials for actuation under forces or external stimuli. Systematic theoretical framework will be developed to predict the kinematics and constitutive modeling of 2D and 3D kirigami structures, with validation by numerical simulation, fabrication, and experimental testing. For 2D structures, a unified design of patterned cuts will account for both symmetric and non-symmetric deformation. The quantitative relationship between the overall mechanical properties and the geometry of localized cut structures will be determined through developed homogenization continuum model. 3D reconfigurable kirigami structures will be constructed from either (self-) folding of kirigami sheets or assembly of 3D cut polyhedron units as fundamental building blocks for architected structures. For 3D architected kirigami structures, their reconfigurability and mechanical properties will be determined by the deformation modes in localized 3D cut units.

The answer to this question is unclear. For example, some research has suggested that meditation changes human attention and alters the body's immune response, blood pressure, and other physiological markers. Other research has found that active church going may improve one's health. Weekly church attendance has been found in some studies to add two years on average to the length of the congregant's life. However, critics point out that the reported improved health could result simply from relaxation (in the case of meditation) and social support (in the case of church going), and have nothing to do with the religious contexts in which these practices take place. To help resolve this debate, anthropologist Tanya Marie Luhrmann will use scientific measures to examine the effects of religion-based training on cognitive performance.<br/><br/>Dr. Luhrmann and her team will focus on one group of religious practitioners who train for intensive prayer practice. The researchers will collect data from this population by combining intensive and repeated interviewing with a neuroscience evaluation using a tested EEG neurophysiological protocol. They will collect data from both highly experienced practitioners and novices to see whether those who are more experienced perform differently. Findings from the research will help health researchers better understand if there is a neurophysiological basis to reported experiences of mental cultivation and whether training affects these experiences.

To study social behavior in nature, the investigators will use microchipped individuals of the well-studied food-storing bird species, the mountain chickadee, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-technology in feeders that can provide different resources to each individual bird. The researchers will test whether differences in winter environmental conditions at higher and lower elevations in the mountains are associated with differences in social organization and information sharing; whether variation in learning and memory used in finding stored food is associated with differences in social behavior; whether reliability of information that individual birds provide to other birds affects their social status and social organization; and how changes in social groups to affect social group structure and function. This project will provide training to a postdoctoral researcher and numerous graduate and undergraduate students, collaborating with the UNR Biology Undergraduate Research Program and the Center for Student Cultural Diversity to recruit students from under-represented groups. The investigators will also create scientific displays for the members of the public and students from local schools at the University of Nevada Reno Museum of Natural History and at the local field research station. <br/> <br/>The evolution of sociality has been a topic of major interest in biology for decades. Questions about the causes and functions of social group structure have recently received a resurgence with the rapid development of social network analyses. Major challenges in collecting social network data lie in the reliable detection of social contacts, especially in highly mobile, free-living animals. The use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has enabled automated detection of individual movements and contacts and allows a rather unprecedented avenue for investigating social behavior, notably by manipulating individual access to resources and hence the ability to experimentally re-structure who individuals interact with. This project will use comparative and experimental approaches to investigate structure, function and fitness consequences of social networks in environments that differ in winter climate severity in a highly social, resident, food-caching species that uses spatial cognition to find numerous food caches for overwinter survival, the mountain chickadee. Using a well-established field system in the Sierra Nevada mountains and RFID-based feeders this project will test whether (a) there are environment-related differences in social network structure and function; (b) variation in spatial cognitive ability is associated with differences in network position and function; (c) reliability of information and distribution of food resources affect social network structure and individual network positions; and (d) experimental, food-related reassignment of birds into different social groups are temporally stable and have fitness consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. <br/><br/>While we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database. The proposal team will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates will be meaningfully involved in data collection and interpretation. The team will also develop new educational activities for both high school and college-level audiences.

There is concern that rapid changes at these ice shelves can destabilize parts of the ice sheet and accelerate their contribution to sea-level rise.  The goal of this project is to understand and simulate the fracture mechanics of calving and to develop physically-consistent calving schemes for ice-sheet models.  This would enable more reliable estimation of Antarctic mass loss by reducing the uncertainty in projections.  The research plan is integrated with an education and outreach plan that aims to (1) enhance computational modeling skills of engineering and Earth science students through a cross-college course and a high-performance computing workshop and (2) increase participation and diversity in engineering and sciences by providing interdisciplinary research opportunities to undergraduates and by deploying new cyberlearning tools to engage local K-12 students in the Metro Nashville Public Schools in computational science and engineering, and glaciology.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide fundamental understanding of iceberg calving by advancing the frontiers in computational fracture mechanics and nonlinear continuum mechanics and translating it to glaciology.  The project investigates crevasse propagation using poro-damage mechanics models for hydrofracture that are consistent with nonlinear viscous ice rheology, along with the thermodynamics of refreezing in narrow crevasses at meter length scales. It will develop a fracture-physics based scheme to better represent calving in ice-sheet models using a multiscale method. The effort will also address research questions related to calving behavior of floating ice shelves and glaciers, with the goal of enabling more reliable prediction of calving fronts in whole-Antarctic ice-sheet simulations over decadal-to-millennial time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine how key traits vary with depth in common eelgrass (Zostera marina), one of the most important foundation species in temperate nearshore ecosystems worldwide. The investigators will use a combination of experiments in the field and lab, paired with fine-scale molecular analyses, to determine the genetic and environmental components of seagrass trait variation. This work will provide important information on the microevolutionary mechanisms that allow a foundation species to persist in a variable environment, and thus to drive the ecological function of whole nearshore communities. The Northeastern University graduate and Keene State College (KSC) undergraduate students supported by this project will receive training in state-of-the-art molecular techniques, as well as mentorship and experience in scientific communication and outreach. A significant portion of KSC students are from groups under-represented in science. Key findings of the research will be incorporated into undergraduate courses and outreach programs for high school students from under-represented groups, and presented at local and national meetings of scientists and stakeholders.<br/> <br/>Local adaptation, the superior performance of ""home"" versus ""foreign"" genotypes in a local environment, is a powerful demonstration of how natural selection can overcome gene flow and drift to shape phenotypes to match their environment. The classic test for local adaptation is a reciprocal transplant. However, such experiments often fail to capture critical aspects of the immigration process that may mediate realized gene flow in natural systems. For example, reciprocal transplant experiments typically test local and non-local phenotypes at the same (often adult) life history stage, and at the same abundance or density, which does not mirror how dispersal actually occurs for most species. In real populations, migrants (non-local) often arrive at low numbers compared to residents (local), and relative frequency itself can impact fitness. In particular, rare phenotypes may experience reduced competition for resources, or relative release from specialized pathogens. Such negative frequency dependent selection can reduce fitness differences between migrants and residents due to local adaptation, and magnify effective gene flow, thus maintaining greater within-population genetic diversity. The investigators will combine spatially paired sampling and fine-scale molecular analyses to link seed/seedling trait variation across the depth gradient at six meadows to key factors that may drive these patterns: local environmental conditions, population demography, and gene flow across depths. The team will then experimentally test the outcome of cross-gradient dispersal in an ecologically relevant context, by reciprocally out-planting seeds from different depths and manipulating relative frequency in relation to both adults and other seedling lineages. The possible interaction between local adaptation and frequency-dependence is particularly relevant for Zostera marina, which represents one of the best documented examples of the ecological effects of genetic diversity and identity. Further, a better understanding of seagrass trait differentiation is not simply a matter of academic interest, but critical to successful seagrass restoration and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Models of how the viscosity of the lower crust affects this portion of the seismic cycle are based on rocks with simplistic homogeneous viscosities.  However, most natural rocks have heterogeneities due to alignments of minerals called foliations, which will affect the mechanical behavior of these rocks.  The principal investigator and students are determining how the viscosity of common foliated rocks is affected by the orientation of these foliations relative to the direction of loading.  They are performing laboratory experiments at conditions that simulate deformation in the mid to lower crust on two different foliated rocks with the foliation in a variety of orientations.  The results of these experiments will be incorporated into a model that evaluates how foliations affect the viscosity of rocks relative to homogeneous rocks, which will benefit society by: 1) improving our understanding of the response of the lower crust to loading during the seismic cycle, 2) supporting research experiences of several graduate students and several undergraduate students, and 3) supporting Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) outreach activities to underprivileged students.<br/><br/>Understanding the effects of foliation orientation, interconnectivity and preexisting lattice preferred orientations on viscous anisotropy is critical in order to accurately model the rheology of the lower crust and the earthquake cycle.  In this project the principal investigator and students will: 1) determine if micaceous foliation orientation causes viscous anisotropy of lower crustal rocks, 2) determine how interconnectivity of the micaceous foliation affects the degree of viscous anisotropy of lower crustal rocks, and 3) determine how a preexisting lattice preferred orientation (LPO) affects viscous anisotropy of these rocks.  These researchers will perform both axial compression and shear deformation experiments with a fine-grained biotite + quartz + plagioclase gneiss or a micaceous quartzite with the foliations and preexisting lattice preferred orientations in a range of orientations relative to the compression direction.  The samples from these experiments will be analyzed using the petrographic microscope, Scanning Electron Microscopy/ Electron backscatter diffraction (SEM/EBSD) to characterize grain-scale microstructures and lattice preferred orientations, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine water contents and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to determine deformation mechanisms.  Portions of this study will be performed in the Advanced Structural Geology course at the University of Akron and thin sections from experimental samples will be used in the laboratory section of the Structural Geology course at the University of Akron.

However, the Standard Model leaves open many questions, including why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of quarks and leptons, and the properties of dark matter, among others. Most explanations require new phenomena, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM), and which the LHCb experiment at CERN has been designed to explore. This award provides facility operations, maintenance, and computing support to enable the participation of U.S. scientists in the LHCb experiment at CERN. <br/><br/>The LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions. The LHCb experiment is one of four large experiments at the LHC and is designed to study in detail the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks. The goal is to identify the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. The new physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, allowing new phenomena to be observed indirectly. <br/><br/>U.S. groups play a leading role in the physics analysis, hardware development, and computing of LHCb.

In these systems, the key enabler of their functional intelligence is the sensing capability, which collects necessary road information to enable better control decisions. However, sensor data are collected from a public channel, i.e., the physical transportation environment, which thus inevitably creates opportunities for attackers to tamper with the sensing process. In this project, the investigator initiates research efforts towards achieving a systematic understanding of the robustness of software-based control in emerging smart transportation systems under sensor attacks. Since transportation is a basic urban function, the successful completion of this project is expected to proactively identify and address new security challenges in these systems before wide deployment, and thus help ensure the security and safety of everyday life.<br/><br/>In this project, an automatic approach will be designed, implemented, and evaluated to enable efficient and effective discovery of security problems in emerging smart transportation systems. The approach focuses on discovering semantic security problems, which for example change control decisions in the smart transportation functions. This is because analyzing them usually leads to the discovery of novel and domain-specific design trade-offs in an area or even across areas, which thus has more potential to advance knowledge and guide future research. To achieve this goal, this project will design a dynamic security analysis system following an evolutionary algorithm approach, and propose novel solutions to address research challenges in analysis input generation, semantic problem discovery, and analyzing dataflow-centric decision process. This project will concretely apply the developed system to real-world code bases of smart transportation systems to ensure the practicality of the discovered security problems, challenges, and solution directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will examine how key traits vary with depth in common eelgrass (Zostera marina), one of the most important foundation species in temperate nearshore ecosystems worldwide. The investigators will use a combination of experiments in the field and lab, paired with fine-scale molecular analyses, to determine the genetic and environmental components of seagrass trait variation. This work will provide important information on the microevolutionary mechanisms that allow a foundation species to persist in a variable environment, and thus to drive the ecological function of whole nearshore communities. The Northeastern University graduate and Keene State College (KSC) undergraduate students supported by this project will receive training in state-of-the-art molecular techniques, as well as mentorship and experience in scientific communication and outreach. A significant portion of KSC students are from groups under-represented in science. Key findings of the research will be incorporated into undergraduate courses and outreach programs for high school students from under-represented groups, and presented at local and national meetings of scientists and stakeholders.<br/> <br/>Local adaptation, the superior performance of ""home"" versus ""foreign"" genotypes in a local environment, is a powerful demonstration of how natural selection can overcome gene flow and drift to shape phenotypes to match their environment. The classic test for local adaptation is a reciprocal transplant. However, such experiments often fail to capture critical aspects of the immigration process that may mediate realized gene flow in natural systems. For example, reciprocal transplant experiments typically test local and non-local phenotypes at the same (often adult) life history stage, and at the same abundance or density, which does not mirror how dispersal actually occurs for most species. In real populations, migrants (non-local) often arrive at low numbers compared to residents (local), and relative frequency itself can impact fitness. In particular, rare phenotypes may experience reduced competition for resources, or relative release from specialized pathogens. Such negative frequency dependent selection can reduce fitness differences between migrants and residents due to local adaptation, and magnify effective gene flow, thus maintaining greater within-population genetic diversity. The investigators will combine spatially paired sampling and fine-scale molecular analyses to link seed/seedling trait variation across the depth gradient at six meadows to key factors that may drive these patterns: local environmental conditions, population demography, and gene flow across depths. The team will then experimentally test the outcome of cross-gradient dispersal in an ecologically relevant context, by reciprocally out-planting seeds from different depths and manipulating relative frequency in relation to both adults and other seedling lineages. The possible interaction between local adaptation and frequency-dependence is particularly relevant for Zostera marina, which represents one of the best documented examples of the ecological effects of genetic diversity and identity. Further, a better understanding of seagrass trait differentiation is not simply a matter of academic interest, but critical to successful seagrass restoration and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The site targets participants from diverse backgrounds who do not have the opportunity to participate in this type of research. The participants work in a multi-tiered mentoring program interacting with faculty, scientists, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students. When coupled with the community building activities, this makes a positive and memorable experience, encouraging participants to pursue further research training. <br/><br/>During the ten week summer program, Engineers for Exploration (E4E) site participants work closely with scientists, explorers, and engineers to develop technology that generally focuses on remote sensing with elements in robotics, computer vision, data analytics, machine learning, and visualization. For example, previous participants designed, prototyped and deployed systems to create large scale visualizations of the Maya archaeological site El Zotz in Guatemala, track endangered iguana hatchlings across different Caribbean Islands, and document ecological characteristics of mangroves in Baja California, Mexico. The primary goal of this REU site is to expose the undergraduate participants to real-world, hands-on research projects. The participants work full-time during the summer to build technology that will ultimately be deployed in the field by scientists, researchers, and explorers. The development of this technology brings together the techniques and skills from the participants' undergraduate classes with real-world problems, and thus provides a sound connection between theory and practice. The hope is that exposure to cutting-edge, applied research will motivate them to consider graduate school and become the next generation of researchers. To accomplish this overall goal, the REU site has four specific objectives: 1) Involve participants in intellectually stimulating, multidisciplinary projects, 2) Provide real-world projects with mentorship from scientists and explorers, 3) Recruit and attract a diverse population of top quality students from a variety of backgrounds in engineering, and 4) Develop mentorship, leadership, and teamwork skills amongst the post-doctoral scholars, graduate students, and REU participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, out-of-season frosts damage crops costing billions of dollars annually, and restricting growing seasons to avoid potential frosts likely costs in the tens of billions. Also important, the global population is expected to rise and the need to grow more crops on the same land is immediate. Poor understanding of freezing tolerance mechanisms constrains development of more tolerant crops. This project will ultimately provide new knowledge that can guide strategies to engineer freezing tolerance in crop plants. An enzyme named ""Sensitive to Freezing 2"" (SFR2) is known to help plants survive freezing by changing the building blocks of chloroplast membranes. Although SFR2's action is known, the way that SFR2 is activated to respond to freezing conditions and the way that its actions provide an advantage are only hypothesized. This project tests the hypotheses using a unique blend of genetics, biochemistry, and biophysical approaches. It is expected that the results will immediately enhance efforts to generate cold-tolerant crops and will also impact research on membrane temperature stability in other species and engineering systems. Throughout the project, training of Nebraskan post-doctoral researchers and graduate students in plant science will be improved to include public communication and other convergent skillsets. In doing so, members of the general public in Nebraska will also benefit.<br/><br/>An enzyme known as Sensitive to Freezing 2 (SFR2) remodels the chloroplast envelope membranes by reducing monogalactolipids and increasing oligogalactolipids. Plants expressing catalytically inactive point mutants of SFR2 are more susceptible to freezing than wildtype plants. Recent evidence from the investigator's lab indicates that SFR2 is activated during freezing by cytoplasmic acidification. Acidification of the cytoplasm also occurs during other stresses in which SFR2 is not active. This and other data suggest that SFR2 activity is tied to a more global cellular response to freezing temperatures in which it directly stabilizes the chloroplast envelope membranes by altering their physical properties. This project will test this hypothesis through the following objectives: (1) Define how membrane stability is affected by SFR2-dependent changes to lipids. (2) Determine if SFR2 activity is repressed by post-translational modification. (3) Define the diversity of chloroplast envelope membrane freezing stabilization mechanisms. These objectives identify mechanisms allowing membrane integrity during freezing temperatures and define how they work (Obj. 1, Obj. 3), and they define a critical cellular freezing signal (Obj. 2). Finally, they will also provide a comprehensive understanding of chloroplast envelope stabilization mechanisms useful in multiple fields. The following training and science literacy objectives are integrated with the above research: (4) Provide comprehensive training for next-generation scientists to be effective researchers and communicators. (5) Educate and engage the public on the societal impact of plant science with innovative graphic novels and interactive presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mucins are the major protein component of mucus hydrogels that coat epithelial tissues, and are essential for life. Yet, mucins remain challenging to study due to a lack of tools to analyze and manipulate protein glycoforms. Lack of reproducible access to sufficient quantities of homogeneous mucins has hindered research in many areas of science and medicine. Mucin-mimicking multi-domain polypeptides with precise glycosylation patterns and tunable domain are chemically synthesized by sequential polymerization of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. The glycopolypeptides are assembled into hydrogels containing varied compositions of salts, lipids, and DNA to investigate factors responsible for mucus' bulk physical properties. The contributions of glycan-binding bacteria and galectins to the stiffness or degradation of mucus will also be explored. Overall, this study provides new materials for the study of mucus at the molecular level.

Atomic clocks have been instrumental in the advancement of science and technology in the twentieth century, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advanced communications, and tests of fundamental theories of particle physics. A next generation optical atomic clock would extend the capabilities of these systems and will enable enhanced security for data routing and communications, advanced earth and space time-based navigation, and ever more precise testing of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Ultracold neutral plasmas (UCNPs) are laser produced plasmas that stretch the boundaries of traditional plasma physics.  However, studies of these table-top ultracold systems are promising to greatly improve our understanding of much hotter and denser plasmas thought to occur in many astrophysical systems. The goal of this project is to laser cool, trap and photo-ionize neutral atomic beryllium for its potential use as an optical frequency standard, and to produce a UNCP at a sufficiently low temperature for ionic crystals to form inside the system, virtually freezing the plasma.  This award will also make it possible to attract and retain more underrepresented minority students to physics studies.  The project will involve minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via existing Univ. of Alabama - Birmingham programs to participate in research projects in the Simien Spectroscopy and Laser Cooling group. Additional outreach activities will aim to get K-12 students interested in science and engineering by performing physics and chemistry demonstrations at local schools in the region.<br/><br/>This project is an experimental program directed towards investigation of spectroscopic, laser cooling, and photoionization properties of atomic beryllium as it relates to atomic clocks and ultracold neutral plasmas. Be is an alkaline earth element with a simple internal structure which provides for electric-dipole and intercombination transitions in the optical regions for both neutral atoms and ions.  It is a promising candidate for next generation frequency standards and for laser cooling, trapping, and photo-ionization to produce an ultracold plasma. In particular, the spectroscopic studies will involve measurements of the hyperfine structure of strong electric dipole transitions. The objective of this study is to determine Be hyperfine constants, which define the ordering of the hyperfine peaks and contributions to the energy shifts from the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions. The determination of this spectroscopic property is necessary for implementing laser cooling and trapping of beryllium. In addition, laser cooling and trapping will be used to create a magneto-optical trap as the first step towards performing precision measurements on the intercombination lines.  It will also be used for photoionization studies for generation of a Be based frequency standard and an ultracold neutral plasma that can be efficiently laser cooled into the strongly coupled regime.

Some of these changes are associated with local human activities, and some are associated with broader climate changes. Increases in salinity are expected to have important impacts because many aquatic organisms evolved in and require low-salinity environments. Ecologists report that increases in salinity adversely affect some groups of aquatic organisms (e.g., aquatic insects such as mayflies, a focus of this project) that are ecologically important and serve as a primary food source for fishes and birds. Thus, modest increases in salinity could greatly affect both the biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. This project is designed to better understand how and why different aquatic insect species vary in their ability to thrive in waters of different salinity. The research will advance understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which salinity affects the metabolism, growth, and survival of aquatic insects, and, ultimately, their distributions and abundance. Project results will help local, tribal, state, and federal water resource agencies and their constituents and stakeholders better interpret monitoring data on aquatic insects, which are widely used as indicators of water quality and ecological conditions.  At least three graduate students and several undergraduate researchers will be supported and trained in the project, and the investigators will contribute to K-12 curriculum development related to water quality and ecological physiology.<br/><br/>The project will expose a new mayfly model species to short-term and long-term salinity gradients to establish how gene expression patterns, oxygen consumption, hemolymph chemistry, and gill physiology link to measures of fitness. Using comparative methods, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the efficiency of ion uptake in dilute environments and the ability to curtail excessive ion uptake in ion-rich environments are key osmoregulatory characteristics that can shape salinity niches. The investigators further hypothesize that the energetic costs of ion transport interact with temperature to influence growth, fecundity, and mortality to define species-specific salinity niches, the expression of which in nature can be observed from niche analyses of field survey data. The study will significantly advance understanding of how both natural variation in salinity and human-induced changes in salinity contribute to organismal performance and species distributions in an increasingly salty world. By integrating different levels of biological organization (genes to biodiversity patterns) and laboratory and field work, the project should significantly advance the synthesis of physiology and macroecology. The project will also help establish and evaluate a promising and needed model aquatic insect species, and will provide foundational understanding of osmoregulation differences across taxa that will inform the use of aquatic insects as ecological indicators of environmental change.

Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. <br/><br/>While we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database.

Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants appreciate the value of conducting trauma-related research with direct input from members of the defined population.<br/><br/>This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8-10 students each year. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 6-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions. Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year, a diverse group of students including women and underrepresented minorities are targeted for recruiting. The success with this aspect is assured by a network of faculty and alumni contacts at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and institutions with significant Native American and Hispanic populations, and the University's infrastructure for minority recruiting. Additionally, a few students who may have not performed well in courses, but show indication of originality and creativity, are included. The selected students participate in experimental and theoretical research projects in nanoscale materials, condensed matter, soft matter, biophysics, photonics, lasers, and quantum optics. They acquire skills and practices essential to scientific problem solving and for working in a collaborative environment through mentoring from faculty, post-doctoral scholars, and senior graduate students. They visit high-tech industries, participate in professional development activities that include weekly seminars, workshops on laboratory safety, library database searches, graduate school applications, oral and written communications skills, a participatory scientific ethics course, and social/cultural activities with other REU groups. The evaluation process incorporates both direct measures of student success and indirect measures (student, mentor, alumni survey) of learning and achievements to provide guidance to continually upgrade the REU program and broaden its impact. Many participants in the REU site continue with graduate studies or find employment directly after graduation in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The REU participants work on carefully chosen research projects on topics of current interest such as properties of nanoscale materials, thermal motion of free standing grapheme using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomically thin material quantum devices, solid-state nanopore fabrication for detection of DNA, phase transition in two dimensional atomic materials beyond graphene, light-quantum dot interaction, lasers, structured light beams, quantum correlations in light, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and statistical and nonlinear physics of extremophiles and the brain. Through engagement with their research projects for ten weeks, the participants receive technical training in using the state of the art instruments, and computational and analytical research techniques. They experience the creative process involved in scientific research starting from the formulation of a problem to its solution, the ups and downs, and the eventual thrill of a new discovery. At the end of the summer, students present their research at a REU symposium. Many go on to present the results of their research at national/international scientific conferences and publish papers based on their work in scientific research journals. Each REU participant leaves having acquired technical skills in the use of advanced scientific instruments and softer skills to be a productive member of the nation's scientific and technical workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, over 1,000 species have been discovered in this remarkable amber. Scientific study of Dominican amber began with an NSF-funded expedition by Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) entomologist Milton Sanderson, who visited the island in 1959 to study beetles. Having learned of rich amber deposits he set out to find them with the help of local guides and collected a large sample that he brought back to the INHS. The following year he published a short paper reporting his discovery, thereby kickstarting scientific study of this ancient ecosystem. Sanderson's collection is therefore, tremendously important both scientifically and historically, yet remains unstudied, still unsorted and unprocessed in the original five-gallon buckets in which it was collected. Years of substandard storage has taken its toll on the amber, which has undergone significant oxidation and is now incredibly fragile. This project will allow the collection to finally be screened for inclusions, conserved using state-of-the-art resin embedding techniques, curated, and digitized. This will unlock a wealth of important data concerning ancient biodiversity, ecology, and climate that is currently hidden and inaccessible within the collection.  In addition to making this data available to the scientific community and the public for the first time, it will also provide valuable experience to graduate and undergraduate students beginning their careers in science.<br/><br/>The Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) at the University of Illinois is home to the Milton Sanderson Dominican Amber Collection (MSDAC).  In addition to its historical importance as the first substantial collection of Dominican amber, the MSDAC is hugely significant scientifically.  It comprises a large (ca. 70 kg) bulk sample of amber that remains almost entirely unprocessed; i.e., it still resides in the five-gallon buckets in which it was collected and has yet to be screened for fossils.  Aside from its size, the unscreened nature of the collection means that it has not been subject to collector bias and no inclusions have been discarded, as typically happens in collections made commercially and sold to museums or private collectors.  As a result, the MSDAC presents a unique opportunity to study an unbiased collection that promises to deliver a more complete picture of the paleobiodiversity and paleoecology of the Early Miocene Dominican amber forest. Unfortunately, decades of substandard storage have resulted in substantial oxidation damage putting the collection at significant risk. This project will focus on the stabilization, conservation, curation and digitization of the MSDAC. A state-of-the-art vacuum resin embedding technique, in which specimens are embedded in a high-quality synthetic resin, will be used to stabilize the oxidized amber. Trimming and polishing of stabilized specimens will allow identification of inclusions and facilitate photomicrography of specimens for inclusion in an online database. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in every step of the process, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ecosystems in the northwest Atlantic Shelf, including in the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight, have experienced some of the fastest decadal and 30 year warming rates in the historical record, and these strong warming trends were punctuated by marine heatwaves in 2012, 2016, and 2018.  Most studies of climate impacts in the ocean have focused on how rising temperatures affect individual species. This project focuses on the impact of warming, both short-term events and long-term trends, on the entire ecosystem. It leverages the region's recent warming and history of consistent sampling to contrast the properties of the plankton and fish communities in the colder Gulf of Maine with the warmer Mid-Atlantic Bight.  Through statistical analyses, size-based modeling, and food web modeling, this project evaluates direct and indirect influences of temperature on biological processes, community characteristics, and emergent ecosystem properties. This study characterizes composition and features of the plankton and fish communities and compares ecosystem changes across space and through time.  It also isolates the direct influence of temperature on metabolism and growth from the indirect influence of temperature through changes in the oceanography. An understanding how marine ecosystems respond to warming is essential to successfully manage these ecosystems in a changing climate. The project team is actively engaged in translating knowledge into fisheries management at a regional and national level. This project also educates the next generation of citizens and scientists by expanding the ecosystem modeling activity in the Gulf of Maine Research Institute's LabVenture program, which serves ~10,000 Maine middle school students each year. An online curriculum on modeling, a topic area in the Next Generation Science Standards that many teachers find challenging is under development. The project also supports a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student and contributes to Stony Brook University's program to encourage participation of women in the sciences.<br/><br/>Temperature affects metabolism and growth, with most species growing faster but maturing earlier and at a smaller size in warmer conditions. This project characterizes the direct influence of temperature on fish growth patterns and incorporates this knowledge into a trait-based, size-spectrum model of a fish community. This model quantifies how changes in temperature and zooplankton composition translate into changes in size structure of the fish community. Warming causes poleward movement of species such that traditionally cooler ecosystems come to resemble warmer ecosystems of the past. This project uses a dynamic food-web model to synthesize how changes in species composition have altered the flow of energy in Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Bight ecosystems. It also quantifies the stability of these communities and their resilience to perturbations like marine heatwaves, with the expectation that gradual warming causes communities to become more diverse and thus more stable, while abrupt warming may have the opposite effect. Both components contrast the ecosystem properties in the warmer mid Atlantic with those in the cooler Gulf of Maine as well as those properties in the past with those under the recent very warm conditions. The comparative approach also untangles the direct impact of warming on organisms from the indirect effects from vertical stratification. In particular, comparing the recent thermally stratified period with the 1990s, when reduced salinity led to an abrupt, multi trophic-level community shift, make it possible to isolate the direct effects of temperature from its influence through hydrography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Speciation involves the buildup of barriers to reproduction between diverging species. This buildup can result from the interplay of evolutionary forces such as natural selection and gene flow. This research investigates these evolutionary forces in a group of three native Texas Phlox wildflowers. Focusing on these three species, the research will determine how and why reproductive isolation evolves. Across Texas, these species of wildflowers can be found growing together in populations and hybridizing. This research involves a detailed investigation of what drives the evolution of traits to decrease hybridization between one pair of species and prevents the evolution of these traits in another pair. This research combines ecological studies with genetic and genomic studies. By doing so, it will test long standing hypotheses about how and why species form. This project integrates undergraduate students in a course-based research experience. This experience will allow students to study speciation hands-on and learn about the scientific method. By working with the local natural history museum, this project will engage K-12 grade students and teachers in plant evolution-based activities.<br/><br/>This project investigates how selection, gene flow, and recombination contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation between co-occurring species. Phlox drummondii co-occurs with two closely related Phlox species but has evolved increased reproductive isolation with only one of these two species. To determine why reproductive isolation evolves with one species and not the other this project will measure the cost of hybridization. Further, the research will measure the strength of existing barriers to reproduction and the amount and direction of gene flow between species. This project integrates field-based studies of pollinator attraction with greenhouse studies of controlled matings and hybrid success. In addition, it will include detailed genomic studies to investigate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and gene flow between species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interfaces between soft and hard materials (soft-hard) or soft and soft (soft-soft) materials are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications, such as tendon on bone for load-bearing, mucus on tongue for prey capture, growing tissues on scaffolds, and bonding silicon on elastomers for stretchable electronics. A fundamental understanding of mechanics of soft material interfaces will help diagnose failures of biological joints and design underwater adhesive patches, flexible electronics, and strong, tough and lightweight composites, which are urgently needed to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. The integrated education plan includes an interactive teaching module with demonstrations of soap bubbles, kids' stickers and poly dough for outreach programs, participations in summer research intern programs for high school students, and integration of computational tools in the graduate and undergraduate curriculums at Syracuse University. A ""Science and Play"" outreach program for K-12 students and the general public will be organized in the Manlius Library annually to promote STEM education. Furthermore, the Women in Science and Engineering program at Syracuse University will be leveraged to encourage the participation of students from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>A major challenge in the mechanics of interfaces in soft materials is that their mechanical behaviors are intrinsically multiscale and multiphysics interactions, which are determined not only by microstructures at interfaces but also the nonlinear strong coupling of surface and bulk deformations. This challenge will be tackled by seamlessly integrating model techniques at different scales in a unified framework with high parallel computation efficiency. Specific tasks include: (1) to bridge coarse-grained models and finite element methods through lattice models and implement the model in the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS), (2) to link deformed configurations of soft-soft interfaces with their molecular structures and nonlinear deformation and surface stress at macroscale levels and study how multiscale couplings govern forces in wet adhesion with large deformation of soft solids, (3) to investigate how macroscale deformation confinement and energy dissipation, mesoscale cavitation, fibrillation and instabilities and microscale molecular and polymer structures synergistically determine the strength and toughness of soft-hard interfaces and derive microstructures informed interfacial force-separation law for soft adhesives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There will be two pre-conference workshops addressing methodologies, one on using standardized instruments in ethnographic research; and the other focused on innovative linguistic methods in anthropology. Two other pre-conference workshops will address effective communication and dissemination of research: strategies for successful grant writing and disseminating research findings beyond anthropology. And two additional workshops will be offered during the regular conference hours. The first, Methods in Visual Anthropology, will be a double-session workshop that will offer participants hands-on opportunities for exploring this emerging research and dissemination opportunity. The second will be a writing workshop, scheduled on the last morning of the conference. This workshop will be aimed at advanced dissertation and early career stage anthropologists who have not yet published a scientific article. The workshops will advance psychological and cultural anthropology through advancements and innovations in research design and methodology. Because concepts that have been extensively developed and theorized in the subfield of psychological anthropology have been increasingly abstracted more widely in the behavioral and social sciences, a strong multiplier effect beyond the specific subfield is expected.

Recently, a new materials field has emerged that harnesses large chemical and structural disorder to its advantage. This project will use atomic-scale engineering of structural and chemical disorder to discover and understand these new materials to achieve unprecedented functionalities. This project aims to leverage state-of-the-art film deposition with in-situ structural characterization and atomic-to-micron scale imaging techniques to understand the stabilization of structurally and chemically disordered multicomponent oxides, their complex structure, and the ways disorder induces novel physical properties. The results of this research are anticipated to provide new insights toward realizing new oxide materials and disorder-property relationships. Students in this project are receiving professional training in materials synthesis and the measurement of structural and dielectric properties of materials. Upon graduation, students are qualified for employment in academia and industrial fields - especially those related to microelectronics. This research is integrated with educational activities to engage pre-college students and establish a new pedagogy for physical science classes taught at the high school level. Curriculum components are being developed to introduce scientific practices and atomic-to-macroscopic scale thinking into the high-school classroom using the dielectric properties and applications of ceramics. The effort is bringing teachers together to receive training to integrate these new components into their teaching. The impact and merit of these activities is being assessed using biannual surveys and in-person interviews. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Functionalizing defects and disorder can unlock unprecedented properties in ceramics. To facilitate this functionality, this project seeks to comprehensively  understand, characterize, control, and predict disorder across length scales. In oxides, the magnetic and electronic properties are strongly correlated to their stereochemistry and electronic structure. The introduction of disorder, chemically or structurally, can lead to symmetry breaking, doping, and frustrated bond and electronic configurations that have been associated with emergent and colossal physical properties. The discovery of multicomponent oxides stabilized by a large configurational disorder, so called entropy-stabilized oxides, creates a unique state of matter where enhanced functional properties stemming from the inherent chemical and structural disorder can be realized. This project aims to: 1) utilize real-time characterization to resolve adatom relaxation and evolution of crystal structure during deposition to understand mechanisms of entropy stabilization in oxide thin films, 2) probe disorder, defects, and charge and compositional non-uniformities from atomic- to macro-scale using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and dielectric spectroscopy, and 3) understand the microstructural mechanisms that give rise to the anomalous strain relaxation, large structural changes, and colossal dielectric properties of entropy-stabilized oxides. It is anticipated that results will elucidate new scientific understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that drive stabilization, evolution and disorder of the microstructure, defect formation, and their consequences on dielectric properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such sophisticated movements are often taken for granted.  A majority of individuals with a stroke, however, tend to have persistent hand functional deficits, limiting their ability of living independently.  Human-machine interactions hold great potential to restore motor functions of stroke survivors.  Recently advanced rehabilitative or assistive techniques (e.g., hand exoskeletons) have the ability to substantially enhance motor functions.  However, few of these state-of-the-art techniques have been successfully translated to end users, and one critical limiting factor is the challenge in controlling the many movement directions robustly.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-invasive and robust neural decoding approaches for human-machine interactions that can directly translate to clinical applications.  Accordingly, this project aims to decode the neural command sent from the brain that controls individual finger movements.  This is accomplished by reading activities in the spinal cord using muscle electrical signals obtained from the skin surface.  The decoded finger-specific neural command can then be used to control rehabilitation or assistive robots, which can substantially enhance the quality of human-machine interactions.  This approach can also facilitate wide applications of robotic rehabilitation or assistance in stroke survivors.  The non-invasive nature of the techniques has a great potential for readily clinical translations.  The proposed research will be integrated with education through graduate and undergraduate research involvement and new course development.  Summer projects and demonstration materials on human-machine interactions will be developed for K-12 students.  Outreach programs will be organized to expose the proposed research topics to underrepresented students, highlight the opportunities in science and engineering, and promote students interests in choosing future STEM careers.<br/><br/>The principal investigator's long-term research goal is to develop highly innovative non-invasive tools for human-machine interactions, with a particular interest in better understanding the neuromechanical properties of the upper extremity, and improve the functional performance in individuals with a central or peripheral injury.  Toward this goal, this project aims to decode the descending neural command that controls individual finger movements by extracting spinal motoneuron discharge activities using source separation of high-density electromyogram signals (HD-EMG) from finger muscles. The non-invasive, robust, and real-time neural decoding technique developed will be easy to implement, can accommodate the different impairment levels of individual stroke survivors, and will substantially improve the control quality of exoskeleton or neuroprosthesis. The Research Plan is organized under three aims.  The FIRST AIM is to develop non-invasive offline and real-time neural decoding approaches based on spinal motoneuron discharge probabilities at the population level that are directed at a designated finger.  This aim addresses the need for non-invasive human-machine interface signals that allow robust and intuitive interaction between humans and machines.  Surface EMG signals will be recorded over the targeted extrinsic muscles using an 8x16 channel electrode array with an inter-electrodedistance of 10 mm.  Motoneuron discharge activities will be obtained from different independent component analysis (ICA)-based HD EMG decomposition methods that will be evaluated on both simulated and experimental EMG data obtained from stroke survivors and healthy control subjects.  The decoding accuracy will be evaluated by comparing the decoded neural drive with finger force output and joint angles. Given that binary motoneuron discharge events are used, the decoded neural drive signals are expected to be robust to changes in action potential properties in the EMG signals, background noise, and motion artifacts. The evaluation of the performance and boundary conditions of different source separation algorithms can further ensure robust decoding performance in a variety of situations, especially in clinical populations.  The SECOND AIM is to classify the neural command specific to individual finger movements. This aim addresses the need for effective control of individual/flexible finger movement in developing human-machine interactions. Surface EMG signals will be recorded over the extrinsic forearm muscles using an 8x16 channel HD EMG electrode array and over the intrinsic extensors muscles to fingers using an 8x4 channel grid. Different features from HD EMG activities and from motor unit (MU) distributions will be extracted. With macro and micro level features, different muscle activation regions will be identified for individual fingers using pattern classification approaches. The neural drive associated with specific finger movement will then be calculated based on MU discharge activities of a specific finger. The classified neural command signals can enable robust and flexible control of individual finger movements non-invasively, and dramatically enhance the dexterity of hand function in clinical populations.  The THIRD AIM is to quantify the performance of the decoding technique by controlling a non-invasive neuroprosthesis for dexterous finger grasp patterns. A transcutaneous nerve stimulation technique developed in the PI's group will be used to elicit flexible individual and coordinated finger movements. The neural stimulation system targeting the affected hand of stroke survivors will be controlled by the decoded neural drive from the contralateral/unaffected arm (particularly if the stroke is severe) or from the affected arm, with time-sharing between stimulations and recordings. The force output (force absolute error and force variability) of neural drive controlled stimulation will be compared with the global EMG controlled stimulation to evaluate the performance of the neural decoding technique.  The overall outcomes of the project are expected to ultimately allow stroke survivors to intuitively interact with rehabilitative/assistive devices in a robust and non-invasive manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will build a new Panthalassa-Pacific plate reconstruction back to Mesozoic times from the novel constraints of seismic tomography - seismological images of the Earth?s mantle.  The research is combined with an educational plan that focuses on using Earth interior imaging to help develop the essential but underutilized STEM skill of 3D spatial analysis, an identified core geoscience skill.  Outreach efforts prioritize reaching groups historically underrepresented in the sciences via undergraduate curriculum development, a collaborative partnership with a local inner-city STEM magnet high school, and through summer undergraduate experiences.  <br/><br/>This project will build a tomography-led, full plate reconstruction for the Pacific-Panthalassa realm back to the Mesozoic era that will contribute time-dependent kinematic and tectonic boundary conditions for global models and regional studies.  An unconventional tomographic plate reconstruction workflow is used that involves 3D mapping of slabs from tomography, slab unfolding (retro-deformation), and assigning plate motions to the unfolded slabs in a hierarchical fashion using available kinematic constraints.  The tomographic plate reconstruction model is systematically compared to relevant circum-Pacific geological datasets, and further tested as input boundary conditions for two distinct geodynamic forward modeling approaches using established workflows for the mature codes CitcomS and TERRA.  The resulting plate model will provide an alternative subduction history for more than half of the Earth that can be simulated within other global models.  In addition, the project explores the capabilities and limitations of seismic tomography for linking the deep mantle to the Earth surface for 4D Earth evolution, which supports an identified key research frontier for NSF Tectonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting the evolution of behavior presents special challenges, because behavior often depends not only on the individual doing the behavior (and its genes), but also on other interacting individuals (and their genes). Such complex social behaviors may thus evolve in unique ways, termed evolutionary feedbacks. Although evolutionary feedbacks are believed to be widespread, little is still known about how they work to shape evolution over time. In this project, the researcher will take advantage of a powerful model system (fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster), to directly observe evolutionary feedbacks for aggressive behavior as they are happening over multiple generations in the lab.  The research team will evolve highly-aggressive fruit flies under circumstances in which feedbacks are allowed or restricted.  This will allow the team to determine how feedbacks influence evolution across generations, for both behavior and its underlying genes. This research will provide scientific opportunities to community college students. NSF support will allow talented community college students to experience research for the first time, and contribute to educating the broader community.<br/><br/>Evolutionary feedbacks occur when behavioral evolution in one generation results in altered selection pressures in subsequent generations. Despite longstanding hypotheses that feedbacks should be nearly ubiquitous, little is still known about how feedbacks influence behavioral evolution and its underlying genetic basis. This research will fill this gap in knowledge by manipulating evolutionary feedbacks for aggressive behavior in replicate fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) populations evolving under artificial selection for increased aggressiveness. By manipulating the social environment in which artificial selection occurs, replicate populations will be artificially selected under conditions that permit positive, negative, or no feedbacks, alongside unselected controls. Behavioral changes will be tracked across generations, and whole-genome sequences from evolved populations will be compared to identify population-genomic ""signatures of feedbacks."" Individual genes that are putative targets of selection will be transgenically manipulated to determine their effects on behavior(s), allowing direct measurement of whether different feedbacks target genes with different roles in aggressive interactions. Together, these Aims provide the first direct tests of the hypotheses that evolutionary feedbacks alter the rate, trajectory, and genetic basis of behavioral evolution. The results have the potential to reconcile previously-incongruent studies, and will provide a conceptual and methodological framework for studying the ways that social interactions during individuals' lifetimes scale up to influence evolutionary change across generations. The research will support diverse community college students to experience research in evolutionary genetics during the summer. These scientific enrichment opportunities will provide opportunities for diverse students to enter STEM fields while learning about evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research in humans has found correlations between early experiences and cognitive-behavioral traits. This project will test these relationships using manipulative experiments with swordtail fish. Previous research in fish has determined that a particular kind of stressful social interaction known as sexual conflict (where males and females disagree over mating rates) can lead to an increase in female brain size. Meanwhile, other research has suggested that having to navigate different kinds of social interactions (also known as social complexity) may result in enhanced cognitive capabilities. The research will test these two competing hypotheses by controlling social conditions during rearing in a fish system that exhibits social complexity and sexual conflict. There are three different types of swordtail males, which represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females (high, low or intermediate sexual conflict). By raising female swordtails in social environments that vary in the type of males present, researchers can quantify how sexual conflict and social complexity shape adult behaviors (including anxiety, aggression and sociability), cognition (learning abilities), and determine which brain regions grow or diminish in response to different social experiences.  This research will have broader impacts that affect both local and national students through the investigator's efforts to incorporate her research into local high school outreach program and the Freshman Research Initiative course at the University of Texas, and through student-initiated national media products (YouTube) on this research.<br/><br/>Sexual conflict, the mismatch in optimal mating rates between the sexes, is ubiquitous across animals. While the morphological consequences of this struggle are well-studied, less is known about the behavioral and cognitive consequences of sexual conflict. In this study, the investigator will experimentally examine the developmental effects of sexual conflict in the swordtail fish (Xiphophorus nigrensis), which has three alternative male phenotypes that represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females: courting males (low conflict), coercive males (high conflict), and males who both court and coerce (mixed conflict). Female swordtails will be raised from birth to early adulthood in one of five social environments that vary in levels of both sexual conflict and social complexity.  At adulthood, females will partake in a broad range of assays to determine how social experiences shape behavioral and cognitive traits. These assays evaluate anxiety, sociability and exploratory tendencies as well as associative learning, cognitive flexibility and social cognition capabilities.  Female brains will be examined to determine how social environment influences the development of distinct brain regions and receptor distribution of candidate social pathways including isotocin and synaptic plasticity markers. The results of this experiment will identify how the social environment influences the development of behavioral tendencies, as well as directly test competing hypotheses for enhanced cognition and brain development (sexual conflict versus social complexity). It will also identify which brain regions (focusing on the social decision-making network) undergo differential development in response to specific social interactions associated with conflict and complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This question identifies a key challenge in the field of memory research: translating cognitive neuroscience findings from the laboratory into strategies that are useful in the real-world. Although memory researchers have identified a set of well-accepted findings and strategies for memory success (for example: elaboration, pattern separation, and transfer-appropriate processing), these strategies have rarely been integrated or even contrasted with one another. By doing so in the current project, we may be able to identify common principles of memory function that translate to real-world learning and memory. We expect that these common principles will increase our understanding of how the brain codes memories and will reveal additional strategies that can be used to improve learning. The ideas from this project will be translated into strategies that will be taught to students entering college. This outreach program will increase student confidence and success and is intended to improve educational outcomes relative to higher education costs.<br/><br/>Well-established principles, including transfer-appropriate processing, encoding specificity, and elaboration, are known to produce benefits to long-term memory in the laboratory. However, we do not yet know: 1) how these principles relate to one another or to hippocampal memory representations and 2) how these principles can be translated into real-world implications. The first question is of great theoretical and scientific significance and must be answered for our understanding of long-term episodic memory to advance, whereas the second is of great educational and societal significance and must be answered to improve our educational systems. The current project develops a unified account of the role of context in episodic memory, addressing both questions. This account proposes that elaboration, transfer-appropriate processing, and pattern separation (via hippocampal coding) have cognitive and neural mechanisms in common whose identification will both transform our understanding of long-term memory and lead to new strategies for learning. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of transfer-appropriate processing from a new perspective: as it relates to context and hippocampal activation patterns, 2) test the prediction, derived from cognitive studies of elaborative rehearsal, that variability in context and hippocampal activation patterns improves retrieval, and 3) test the prediction, derived from animal studies of the hippocampus, that pattern separation of similar events increases context resolution and cue specificity. The ideas in this project, along with existing findings, will be taught to incoming university students who are the first in their family to attend college or who are from underserved populations and may not previously have been taught effective strategies for independent learning. The goal of this outreach is to increase confidence and success in college for these students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main cause of battery failure is undesirable chemical side reactions within the device that are difficult to quantify and to understand. Because of this lack of fundamental understanding, engineers are less able to design materials and devices that can withstand side reactions for longer times. In advanced battery designs such as hybrid lithium batteries, gel electrolytes have been favored because they allow high liquid-like conductivities of conventional electrolytes yet favorable mechanical properties and enhanced safety like solid polymer electrolytes. This CAREER project will conduct fundamental research on polymer processing methods to efficiently deposit gel electrolytes inside a battery's porous electrode to form thin protective coatings that improve resistance to unwanted side reactions and provide structural stability. Beyond electrochemical energy storage applications, these studies will enable scalable, rapid polymer depositions that have general relevance in many other applications such as corrosion protection coatings, barrier and dielectric layers, and optical coatings. As educational benefits, this project will train student researchers in critical thinking skills, and in the disciplines of reaction engineering, polymer science, advanced semiconductor processing, and electrochemical energy storage. The PI has also partnered with the Rochester City Public District to introduce chemical engineering principles to high school students using interactive service-learning inspired projects.<br/><br/>The polymer chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process in this project is based on heterogeneous cationic polymerizations. The central hypothesis is that strong acid molecules, which are introduced into the deposition chamber as vapor-phase precursors, react with surface-adsorbed vinyl monomers, generating carbenium ions that then undergo polymerization. The overarching research objective is to understand the fundamental transport and reaction processes that constitute cationic polymer CVD in order to establish synthetic and morphological control of polymer gel electrolytes deposited within porous lithium ion battery electrodes. This project is divided into two thrusts, where the first thrust seeks to establish the reaction mechanism and understand the material properties of the deposited films. The second thrust will research the processing conditions that effectively balance the rate of surface reaction with mass transport to achieve conformal coatings inside porous structures. Novel gel electrolyte materials will be synthesized within electrode porosity using cationic CVD. These two thrusts are highly integrated and will be conducted in concert to discern structure-property relationships and the effects of processing conditions in these novel gel materials. To establish foundational understanding of the gels' electrochemical behavior in relevant lithium ion battery cells, electrochemical characterization of the gels is emphasized including Li ion transport and oxidative stability. Initially, the gel electrolyte composition will be based on crosslinked poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) swollen in conventional alkyl carbonate liquid electrolytes. Over a longer term as both the project and energy storage field advance, additional novel gel compositions will be developed to address material challenges in future lithium battery technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What makes one individual different from another is its unique combination of alleles (versions) of those genes.  By crossing plants carrying different sets of alleles, crop breeders can create new crop varieties, with new combinations of alleles. However, because genes are clustered together on chromosomes, a desirable allele of one gene may be located very close to an undesirable allele of another gene on the same chromosome.  The close clustering, or linkage of genes means that both the desirable and undesirable alleles are inherited together. This research provides tools that allow the plant breeder to separate or replace alleles of linked genes. This technology accelerates the rate at which new and improved crop varieties can be produced. This is an important goal, as the development of new crop varieties is an ongoing race with the evolution of new varieties of pathogens, increasing demand from an expanding world population, unpredictable climate, and the degradation of existing farmland.

Earth scientists recognize that the ability of rivers to erode depends on how much water is delivered to the mountains, and that changes between wetter or dryer climates should influence topography.  The expectation is that changes in climate and the resulting change in erosion are reflected in the topography of a landscape. This project focuses on the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, where deep canyons carved into the Central Andean Plateau margin reflect either tectonic uplift or an increase in erosional efficiency due to climate change. The research incorporates newly-developed methods for diagnosing the effects of climate on topography as part of a field-based investigation to determine the degree to which climate-driven changes in erosional efficiency are responsible for canyon cutting. New remote analysis methods are used to differentiate signatures of tectonic uplift driven erosion and climate driven erosion in topography. Improving the fidelity of these remote methods has considerable societal value because they are an inexpensive and efficient means of hazard assessment in areas where the presence or absence of tectonic uplift, and the resulting effect on seismicity, are uncertain. Additionally, this project wll benefit society by: 1) essential STEM training of three US graduate students including two women, as well as several Peruvian undergraduates; 2) international collaborations with both Peruvian and German universities; and 3) improved STEM education development in Peru and US at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels.<br/><br/>Determination of an active tectonic driver of mountain uplift and the geometry of related structures is critical to resolving how strongly climate and tectonics are coupled. This project tests competing hypotheses for the proximal drivers of canyon cutting into the Eastern Cordillera: incision driven by active rock uplift vs. incision into a previously uplifted plateau margin triggered by climate change. Integration of observations and analyses of the deformation history, landscape morphology, precipitation patterns, and spatial and temporal patterns of erosion and exhumation is used to definitively and quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of active rock uplift and climate change in landscape evolution. Analyses focus on: 1. estimating millennial-scale erosion rates from cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in modern river sands, 2. assessing the role of rainfall in the relation between topography and erosion rate, 3. analyzing cooling ages of low-temperature thermochronometers (AHe, AFT, ZHe) provided by a complementary study, 4. refining geologic mapping and developing balanced cross sections, and 5. integrating all data in models to quantitatively test hypotheses. Results will have broad implications for: 1. the general applicability and fidelity of proposed methods for diagnosing the primary causes of canyon cutting based on analysis of geomorphic data, 2. further development of a methodology to quantitatively link geometry, displacement and rates on faults to exhumation rates, erosion rate patterns and the resulting landscape morphology, 3. quantitative, observation-based understanding of the sensitivity of erosion rates to annual rainfall, and 4. understanding of the nature and strength of linkages among climate, topography, erosion, and tectonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies have experienced exponential growth over the past several decades, thanks to the aggressive scaling of electronic devices. Next-generation information technologies, however, cannot be supported by only scaling transistors, and will rely heavily on data centers and cloud computing to drive performance improvements. We are already experiencing this trend with the increased investment from large technology companies in these sectors. To support this architecture, we need to bring optical interconnect technology (i.e., fiber optics), which is the backbone of the modern internet, to shorter length scales. Going beyond classical computing and communication technologies, quantum mechanics presents an opportunity to realize a paradigm shift in information technology. All these technologies, however, require ultra-low power optoelectronic devices; the power requirement is almost four orders of magnitude lower than that of existing devices. In my research, I aim to create these devices using atomically thin materials integrated with silicon nitride photonic circuits. Specifically, we aim to develop an optical modulator and optical switch, that can change light transmission using minimal power. These devices will be fabricated using well-developed semiconductor manufacturing technology. Along with developing new technology, the proposal aims to incorporate a design-build-test module in existing lecture-based nanophotonics courses to provide hands-on experience to the next-generation knowledge workers in the field of integrated photonics.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Ultra-low-power tunable and nonlinear optical devices hold the key for numerous optical technologies including optoelectronic information processing, communication, and photonic quantum simulations of strongly correlated materials. Currently, the power required to modulate the light transmission through photonic devices or to observe a nonlinear input-output response is too high. This power can be reduced by spatially confining the electronic and photonic wave functions to a nanometer-length scale for an extended period of time. Nanophotonic resonators integrated with emerging low-dimensional materials present an attractive platform to create ultra-low-power optoelectronic devices. To that end, this proposal aims to integrate van der Waals (vdW) materials (e.g., graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides) and their heterostructures with silicon nitride nano-resonators. The choice of silicon nitride is motivated by its large bandgap and compatibility with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing. The vdW materials are chosen for their unique quantum properties, large exciton binding energies, and atomic thinness that enable extremely small active volumes and unprecedented material compatibility; they can be transferred onto any substrate without requiring explicit lattice matching. Combining numerical simulation, device fabrication, and optical characterization, three research aims will be pursued: (i) develop an experiment-driven model for vdW material?cavity coupling; (ii) demonstrate optical nonlinearity at the few photon level in a coupled cavity array, and (iii) create an electro-optic modulator with attojoule electrical energy per switching. While the initial applications of these devices will be in ultra-low-power classical optical information science, the same platform can be used for developing quantum technologies, including quantum many-body simulations and quantum signal transduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But not all language communities benefit equally. In order to perform well, current language technology requires enormous amounts of data, which are not available for smaller languages and dialects such as Navajo or African American Vernacular English. This requirement stands in stark contrast to the learning needs of children, who do not require much to acquire their native language perfectly. Linguists have attributed the ease of language acquisition to innate learning biases--all languages share universal properties, and a learning algorithm that is aware of these universals requires less data. But linguistic models of language universals are couched in terms that make them hard to incorporate into current learning algorithms. Bridging the gap between linguistic theory and language technology requires a mathematically and computationally grounded understanding of universals, both of which are incorporated in this project to inform language science and language technology.<br/><br/>This project develops a computational model of universals in the domain of sentence structure and how it interacts with the shape of words. It adopts a framework that is built on techniques from theoretical computer science, mathematical logic, and abstract algebra. This makes it possible to characterize universals in a manner that is both rigorous and sufficiently flexible to easily accommodate the rich diversity of languages. The researcher will generalize this formal machinery from sounds to words and sentences. The project draws from from the linguistic literature on universals, and feeds it by deriving new universals from the computational analysis. The results  will allow for new machine learning algorithms that incorporate linguistic universals as a strong learning bias. In addition, this award supports the development of an interactive, online learning platform. This resource will enable linguistics students across the country to master the skills they need to study language through a computational lens.

Replacing scarce, expensive noble-metal materials with abundant, cheap, efficient complex metal-oxide alternatives remains a primary challenge facing energy conversion.

This research uses novel microscopy methods and classic semiconductor analysis to visualize and quantify the location and amount of missing oxygen atoms across the critical interface under the operating conditions of actual energy conversion systems, in real time. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of how missing atoms affect energy conversion at the interface is vital to rapidly advancing the development of devices such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. This work trains undergraduate and graduate students across the disciplines of materials science, surface science, and electrochemistry for placement in the energy conversion/storage, electronics, and nanotechnology sectors. This project also includes a fully integrated educational component where an undergraduate student team develops microscopy modules that are demonstrated in both senior capstone and graduate level courses using a portable atomic force microscope.

It aims to enable the full scientific potential of single-phase multicomponent equiatomic rare earth oxides as a new class of functional materials. These oxides have not been explored nearly as extensively as high-entropy metallic alloys and until now have existed only as polycrystalline ceramics. A revolutionary method, micro-pulling-down technique, is used for the first time to demonstrate crystal growth and investigate mechanisms that govern gravity-controlled melt convection during directional crystallization of such complex systems. The project exploits the interplay between the convective and diffusive melt flow patterns in order to enhance melt mixing near the growth interface and achieve stable growth conditions. As a result, phase stability and homogeneous cation distribution in the grown crystals leads to novel phenomena and properties for applications in clean energy, lighting, medical, national security and fundamental physics research that may surpass functionality of traditional one-component compounds. A large number of possible combinations opens a pathway to compositional feasibility of a large number of complex systems. Additionally, the micro-pulling-down method as a tool for materials discovery and synthesis is introduced to the US academic community for both research and education through this research project. Availability of modern crystal growth techniques improves the national competitiveness in materials research and provide opportunities for educating and training future crystal growth scientists. The latter aspect is accomplished by an outreach and education program that integrates high-temperature crystal growth under microgravity with new, hands-on curricula to engage underrepresented groups in science and engineering and encourage the next generation of research professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All matter is composed of elements, and all elements show peculiar chemical properties depending on their positions in the periodic table. A general rule of chemistry is that the characteristics and behaviors of elements are determined by electrons of an atom's outermost orbital. Our current knowledge and practice of chemistry has been limited by the number of elements in the periodic table and the chemical states in which these elements could exist. This project aims to reveal how physical forces can be used to break the above boundary of chemistry. When this happens, the existing elements can drastically change their chemical characteristics and identities and behave like entirely new elements. Using advanced computational techniques, this project will systematically explore the new materials that can be formed by utilizing the physical pressures that alter the chemical properties of elements. Combining with a new quantum mechanics model of atoms in confined space, this project will apprehend how the pressure will transform the periodic table of elements. <br/>The work may largely extend the scope of materials by revealing the transformation of elements under pressure. It may also give rise to knowledge of how the new chemistry can be utilized in designing and obtaining new materials with unusual properties as well as in understanding the behavior and distribution of elements in the interior of Earth and extraterrestrial planets. The computer simulations of atomic and electronic structures will be incorporated into the early curriculum of undergraduate and graduate students in California State University Northridge, a minority serving institution with a large Hispanic enrollment. It will also be introduced to local community college and high school students, providing them with a deeper understanding of materials and chemistry and new skills and tools for their future careers. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research aimed to advance the design and discovery of materials by understanding how the basic chemical character of elements, such as reactivity or oxidation state, can change under pressure and how to utilize this knowledge to make materials with unusual and desired properties. This plan is inspired by a series of striking phenomena uncovered by recent high-pressure research, such as core electrons that become reactive and form chemical bonds, electrons that play the role of anions at the interstitial sites, and noble gases that react with ionic compounds without forming any chemical bond. These phenomena are exciting because they not only alter the chemistry at the very fundamental level, but also can greatly broaden the form and the properties of materials. An in-depth and systematized understanding of how elements behave under different levels of pressure is essential but not yet in place. This emerging area of materials under extreme conditions is difficult to directly study using current high-pressure experiments, and these methods are also time consuming and costly. Rapid and low-cost computer simulation can explore high pressure and have potential to provide guidance to experiment. <br/>The PI will employ computer simulations based on quantum mechanics and automatic crystal structure search methods to address these issues by studying the stability and bonding features of a series of compounds containing focused elements. Specifically, the PI will undertake the following research objectives, exploring: 1) the reactivity of inner core p and d core electrons and its relation to external pressures, and the corresponding bonding feature and the properties; 2) a reverse chemistry phenomena of binary 3d metal compounds; 3) the use of the novel chemistry under pressure in designing and producing new materials with superlative properties; 4) the possibility of representing the chemical behavior of elements under different levels of pressure by a small set of parameters, especially whether and how the periodic table changes under high pressure. <br/>The project integrates research and education through a set of activities including establishing a new computational materials course and lab; training and involving students in cutting edge materials research; and organizing lunch forums and seminars. Furthermore, selected students in other CSUN research groups will be invited to work as guest researchers and integrate computational methods into their own research topics. The educational plan will help increase the involvement of students who are underrepresented in STEM areas. It includes outreach activities to provide students from underrepresented groups with multiple opportunities to explore materials science research, STEM education, and associated educational and professional pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atoms in metals and alloys are arranged in crystal structures with almost perfect periodic patterns, but these structures still contain a small number of imperfections or ""defects"", variations from perfect periodicity. Many mechanical and physical properties depend on how defects are generated and move under the influences of alloying elements, or solutes, in crystal structures. For example, the strength and ductility of metals and alloys are usually controlled by a type of defect called dislocations, and some solute atoms can slow down or speed up dislocation motions to make alloys stronger and more brittle, or softer and more ductile. <br/><br/>This project will focus on defects in advanced alloys based on certain transition-metal elements, such as tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. These alloys can have excellent mechanical properties at high temperatures and are critical for many energy, transport, and aerospace applications, such as structural components of nuclear reactors, turbine engines and electric generators. To develop these advanced alloys with enhanced performance would require the understanding of solute effects on defect behaviors and the corresponding variations of mechanical properties.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop and apply computational methods to predict how solute atoms affect the stability and motion mechanisms of defects in advanced transition-metal alloys. Conventionally, accurate quantum mechanical calculations are applied to study metals and alloys in perfect crystal structures or containing simplified defect structures, but defect behaviors in realistic alloys depend on the evolution of complex structures on the nanoscale and mesoscale, lengths comparable with one-thousandth of a millimeter.  The PI aims to discover intrinsic, universal and quantitative mechanisms that determine defect-solute interactions based on analyses from quantum mechanical calculations. Using these results, the PI will develop the models to predict the solute effects on defect behavior and mechanical properties by bridging the knowledge gaps between electronic, atomistic and mesoscale levels. The research will provide generalized models, computational methods, software tools, and an open access data repository for both the scientific and industrial communities to speed up the development of novel advanced alloys in large compositional space.   <br/><br/>The PI also proposes educational and outreach activities by integration of research and innovative teaching methods. The PI plans to apply virtual reality techniques in teaching complex crystal and defect structures to undergraduates, and to utilize the tools of computational materials science in teaching alloy designs to graduate students. Proposed outreach activities include the education of K-12 students with a diverse background on the topics of crystal structures and thermodynamics based on their interest and familiar subjects such as food processing to increase the public awareness of materials science and engineering. The PI will also participate in the high-school research projects by the Center for Engineering Diversity and Outreach at University of Michigan. All education modules based on virtual reality and simulation tools will also be shared through the public data repository.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports an integrated research and education project to develop new computational approaches to study defect-solute interactions and their effects on the mechanical properties of advanced transition metal alloys by bridging the gaps across electronic, atomistic and mesoscale length scales. Interactions between solute atoms and crystalline defects, including dislocations, and twin and grain boundaries, play essential roles in determining the mechanical and physical properties of many advanced alloys. First-principles theory is ideal for investigating such interactions. However, first-principles calculations are limited by increasing computational intensity with system size, making it difficult to predict the solute and impurity effects on the stability and mobility of defects involving complex atomistic structures, such as dislocation kinks, twin nuclei, and grain boundary complexions.<br/><br/>Recently, the PI discovered a series of strong correlations between defect energetics and local electronic structures in several types of advanced transition metal alloys. These new findings suggest a path to predict accurately complex defect-solute interactions by understanding chemical bonding mechanisms at the electronic level. Based on this approach, the PI aims to: (i) identify generalized and quantitative correlations between local electronic/atomistic structures and defect-solute interactions for multiple types of defects and solutes based on chemical bonding models, first-principles calculations and machine learning methods, (ii) apply the above correlations to construct mesoscale simulation methods and phenomenological models to predict the solute/impurities effects on defect stability and mobility, and (iii) employ the above methods and models to evaluate the mechanical behavior, such as solid-solution hardening/softening, twinability, and grain boundary embrittlement. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to advance fundamental understanding of the intrinsic physical mechanisms of defect-solute interactions that are critical for advanced transition metal alloys to achieve excellent mechanical performance under varying environmental conditions. It will explore the application of machine learning methods for alloy design based on physical models at electronic and atomistic levels. The investigated defect structures will be incorporated into the virtual reality tools to enhance the undergraduates' understanding of lattice and chemical defects and their effects on materials properties; the generated data and computational tools will be applied in education modules to help graduate students to learn the state-of-the-art materials design approaches. These data and tools will also be utilized in outreach education and research activities for K-12 students with diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After bleeding stops, platelets also help the injured tissue heal. Before injury, platelets circulate in the blood stream and have a compact and round shape. This shape ensures that platelets are able to effectively interact with the blood vessel wall if injury occurs. Once injury occurs, signals at the injury site cause the platelet to change shape, going from small and round to spread and star-shaped. This shape change in response to injury is critical for platelets to both stop bleeding and then help to repair the damage tissue after a clot forms. The research component of this project focuses on the development of a new material that mimics the ability of platelets to change shape in response to injury. The developed materials will be tested for their ability to change shape in response to injury signals and for their ability to stop bleeding and improve healing. This proposal will also focus on community outreach in the state of North Carolina. The goals of the outreach component of this project are to increase awareness and support for biomimetic materials engineering. Biomimetic materials are materials that mimic certain aspects of natural systems, such as the materials described in this proposal that mimic platelet function. The outreach goals will be achieved by designing new materials for K-12 summer camps and day camps and by giving talks at local museum events.   <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Natural platelets are pivotal to hemostasis and tissue repair, and platelet shape change in response to thrombin at the wound site is critical for these functions. Prior to injury, platelets display a small, round morphology that enhances margination to the vessel wall; effective margination is essential for rapid clot formation. At the injury site, thrombin activates platelets and induces a significant platelet shape change. This shape change is required for platelet-mediated clot retraction, which contributes to long-term healing. However, the relationship between wound-triggered shape change of platelet-mimetic materials and hemostatic and wound healing outcomes has not been defined. To that end, the over-arching goal of this research project is to develop a wound-triggered, platelet-mimetic microgel that, like native platelets, activates and changes shape in response to thrombin. The research objectives are: 1) Design platelet-mimetic particles that activate and change shape in response to thrombin at the wound site and define the relationship between thrombin concentrations and shape change dynamics; 2) Determine the effect of shape change on particle margination and clotting kinetics; 3) Determine the effect of shape change on clot retraction and wound healing dynamics. The outreach component of this proposal will utilize a two-pronged approach to increase awareness and support for biomimetic materials engineering in the state of NC through 1) the development of educational experiences for K-12 students and 2) participation in museum-based community outreach events. The educational component will integrate with the research component by providing students with hands-on experience with biomimetic materials engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not fully understood how the diversity in root architecture contributes to crop yields or plant biomass in part because roots are buried underground and difficult to study. This research takes a quantitative approach to analyze the wide diversity of root architectures. Bean roots grown under experimental conditions will be imaged and the resulting data will be used to create new mathematical and computational tools to discern causes of root variability. Combined with genomic information, the analytical tools will identify genetic elements underlying root shapes in response to environmental and genetic variation. The research will point to new opportunities for breeding targets in crops such as bean and extended to maize. The research also couples with an education program that integrates computation with plant research, thus addressing the critical national need for a computationally trained plant science workforce. The novel tools will be publicly available and deployed using national cyberinfrastructure: further the technologies will be integrated into two courses that enable basic science and computational biology within an experiential learning environment. A new student award is implemented through the Plant Center and the Georgia Informatics Institute to highlight advances attained by working at the computational and plant science interface. Together, the integration of science and education sets forth a path for fast dissemination of results into breeding programs. <br/><br/>After decades of research on plant roots it is still a mystery how and why root architecture arises in seemingly endless variations of shapes. The research introduces the phenotypic spectrum as a new quantitative theory that extends the established concept of plasticity by a new dimension. The phenotypic spectrum of one genotype consists of distinct root architecture types, each of which is hypothesized to be associated with a different plasticity curve across environments. Theoretically, the phenotypic spectrum emerges for a population of one genotype if all elementary geometric measurements at all locations within each individual root system are taken and each individual is summarized by a whole root descriptor. Descriptors with similar characteristics correspond to one architecture type. Hence, the spectrum is not observable with current phenotyping tools that capture only one location in a root system per trait. Quantifying the phenotypic spectrum demands the development of unprecedented whole root descriptors and simulation techniques to capture the differences in the 3D spatial organization of the whole root architecture. In doing so, a new combination of differential geometry and imaging approaches as well as a newly developed statistical analysis is proposed. The experiments will provide an understanding of how to describe and evaluate the interplay of different root architecture types in the greenhouse and the field by linking both with the developed descriptors. The educational goal is to increase the number of researchers at the interface of computational and plant sciences through two courses using the developed tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second aim develops compounds that emit in the near infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum.  Such compounds may be useful for biological sensing and imaging. The third aim targets compounds for photocatalysts in organic synthesis, which is important for the development of new pharmaceuticals. These research directions are complemented by an education and outreach component that aims to improve general chemistry instruction, introduce K-12 students to concepts of photochemistry, and to engage the general public in scientific learning.

In the opposite extreme of the spectrum, NIR-emitting bis-cyclometalated iridium complexes supported by electron-rich, pi-donating ancillary ligands are prepared. The electron-rich ancillary ligand destabilizes the iridium-centered Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which increases the excited-state metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character, augments radiative rates, and improves photoluminescence quantum yield.

Current nanofabrication processes involve multiple steps and are not suitable for fabricating one-of-a-kind or customized nanostructures in a cost-effective manner. In this project, an ultrashort-pulsed laser, which emits flashes of light (pulses) with extremely short duration, is used to drill, cut and pattern materials with nano-scale precision. Because the duration of a pulse is so short (less than one trillionth of a second), the energy of the laser pulse is highly concentrated in the material, creating conditions that are not normally achieved with other processing methods. Ultrashort-pulsed laser processing provides the key advantage of significantly-reducing collateral damage, that is damaging the surrounding material, and thus improving precision in the processing of a variety of materials. This project advances the understanding of ultrashort-pulsed laser processing of dielectric materials, such as glass and diamond, which are commonly used in display panels, microelectronics and cutting tools. Advances resulting from the project benefits society by enabling a new method for nano-scale patterning that reduces manufacturing time and lowers cost, and by supporting an education and outreach program aimed at cultivating a well-trained manufacturing workforce. The project raises public awareness of laser and optical technologies in everyday life, attracts young students to science and technology, and guides college students to pursue a career in advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/>The new nanolithography method is based on laser ablation using a sequence of ultrashort laser pulses (a pulse train) that is temporally tuned to create localization of free-carrier population and enhanced absorption of laser energy.

New approaches to sustainable development will require materials researchers who have technical expertise and understand the complex interrelationships between materials science and other disciplines. As the premier professional society for materials researchers, the Materials Research Society (MRS) is well positioned to help materials scientists address these challenges. MRS has been building a robust community of practice in this area for many years. In recognition of the critical and cross-cutting role of sustainability in materials science, MRS established the Focus on Sustainability Subcommittee in 2016. This proposal seeks to build on and expand the scope of sustainability activities and programming within MRS, as well as to increase the impact of sustainability within MRS and beyond to the entire materials science community.<br/><br/>The MRS Focus on Sustainability Subcommittee, along with two task forces, will execute three thrusts including: (1) enhancing awareness and understanding of sustainability across MRS; (2) elevating the impact of sustainability efforts within MRS; and (3) training the next generation of materials scientists to incorporate sustainability in their work.  Awareness and understanding of sustainability will be enhanced by meeting attendee engagement through multiple routes, including gamification, handouts, video, and social media, and a special networking event and program at the 2019 MRS Spring Meeting will seek to engage 140 energy and sustainability symposium organizers in the MRS broader sustainability efforts. The impact of the MRS sustainability efforts will be elevated by building on the successful series of high profile, panel discussions on interdisciplinary sustainability topics, as well as starting a new effort to bring in invited speakers on targeted hot topics that intersect with sustainability. A set of new workshops will train materials scientists to more comprehensively incorporate sustainability in their research. Finally, background research on the current status of sustainability in materials science curricula will inform a longer-term reform effort. Together, these efforts have the potential to increase the role of sustainability in materials science research and to inform new approaches to materials science that more completely take sustainability into account.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this CAREER project is to develop simulation methodologies that can predict the geometry of self-assembled structures in organic mixtures. <br/><br/>The project will combine simulation and experimental methods spanning the atomistic to the macro scale to understand and predict fluid structure in organic mixtures. On the atomistic scale, liquid phase neutron diffraction and molecular simulations will provide experimentally consistent insight into the intermolecular structure of organic mixtures. A method called Structurally-Optimized Potential Refinement (SOPR) will be created that can reliably tune force field parameters and coarse-grained molecular geometry to ensure an accurate match to experimental measurements of structure. On the macro scale, the predictive capabilities of newly benchmarked atomistic and coarse-grained simulations will be compared to and informed by continuum properties. The education goals of this CAREER project are integrated with the proposed research to support graduate and undergraduate student mentoring and course development.

Much of this knowledge comes from the scientific collections accumulated over centuries.  These large collections in turn are partly an amalgam of many smaller ones, made and donated by research institutions and naturalists that no longer have the capacity to care for them or make them available to users.  The goal of this project is to provide for the long-term care and accessibility of three important collections received by the Florida Museum. About 67,000 specimen lots (each ""lot"" contains one or more specimens) representing more than 300,000 specimens of diverse marine organisms will be archivally rehoused, and made available online, through loans, and to visitors.  The Florida Museum invertebrate collection (FLMNH-IZ) will be expanded with new shelving and cabinetry to accommodate recent growth.  A cadre of undergraduate students will help to carry out this work, as they also learn about marine life, biodiversity, and museum science in short courses organized as part of the project.<br/><br/>The project will provide new shelf and cabinet space for the greatly increased at FLMNH-IZ. The collection has doubled in size in 15 years as a result of an active field program, and rescue and curation of valuable relinquished collections. The FLMNH-IZ is a major research node for studies on mollusks and tropical marine invertebrates. It serves the third largest collection of specimen-data on non-insect invertebrates in the world and is used broadly by the research community. The collection averages 35-40 visitors, 75-80 loans, and is the basis of 40-50 publications a year. The project will also allow the curation of three high-quality relinquished collections. The Harry Lee collection is perhaps the most important private shell collection in the US and includes specimens of 12,000 identified species.  The Maturo and McKinney Bryozoa collections are among the largest in the country of the poorly known but highly diverse ""moss animals"".  The NOAA-NCRMP collection is an alcohol-fixed, wet collection of reef invertebrates holding several thousand species taken from 26 islands across the tropical Pacific over the past decade, including from several remote, uninhabited, and virtually unknown islands. It offers a wealth of material for systematic and molecular genetic studies of Pacific biodiversity.  These collections will be available physically and online, through resources such as iDigBio (idigbio.org) together with the more than 600,000 specimen records already digitized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to cope with these changes many organisms have evolved circadian rhythms, which allow them to coordinate their biological activity over the course of the day. Circadian rhythms, driven by 24-hour biological clocks, are oscillations in biological activity that peak approximately once per day, and are found ubiquitously throughout nature. This project will elucidate how the circadian clock functions in cyanobacteria, which are the simplest organisms and the only bacteria known to possess a robust circadian clock. The aim of this project is to gain a near comprehensive understanding of the cyanobacterial circadian clock, and help set the foundation for leveraging these bacteria for broad ranging applications including bioremediation, biotechnology, and ecological/environmental issues. Additionally the project will provide research training opportunities for students both by providing undergraduate and graduate research assistantships, but will also reach a greater number of students by introducing an element of inquiry-based research into laboratory modules for both introductory and advanced undergraduate courses. These experiences will provide students with hands-on experience in experimental biology, and also the repetitive and progressive development of concepts will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Moreover, students will present the results of their semester long projects to local elementary and middle school students to promote STEM in K-12 education in the local community. <br/><br/>The project aims to investigate how the core oscillator of  the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942,  is integrated into a three-dimensional cell and how changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the oscillator contribute to the synchronization and robustness of the circadian clock as well as its integration with other cellular processes. While it is known that the subcellular localization and co-localizations of clock proteins that vary in space and time contribute a level of complexity to the circadian clock mechanism, very little is understood about the biological significance of the observed spatiotemporal dynamics occurring with 24-hour periodicity. The research aims to fill in these gaps by investigating how the changes in subcellular localization are achieved and how spatiotemporal changes in the extended clock network contribute to clock function, by using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology including fluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular localization of members of the extended clock network and time-lapse imaging to investigate how the inheritance of clock proteins during cell division contributes to the robustness of the circadian clock and the inheritance of timestamps during cell division. A short list of candidates, identified by immunoprecipitation mass-spectrometry analysis, has been identified for possible contributions to promoting changes in the subcellular localization of the core oscillator proteins and preliminary deletion or depletion of these genes results in various circadian defects. None of these candidates have been previously implicated in the circadian mechanism and thus represent novel avenues for understanding how the clock functions in vivo and how the clock is integrated with various cellular processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical weathering also consumes atmospheric CO2 and thus helps to regulate climate over millions of years, maintaining a long-term balance with volcanic emissions.  Despite significant research, the processes that control chemical weathering remain uncertain and debated. This research project seeks to develop new techniques and innovative modeling approaches to study the rate and extent of chemical weathering of rocks and minerals on the surface of the Earth.  The work will use existing knowledge of lithium isotope chemistry and will develop new knowledge in potassium isotope chemistry to measure weathering.  The work will improve our understanding of the interactions between chemical weathering and climate on geologic time scales and the flux of elements into surface waters. Students from high school to PhD-level, including those from low-income households, first-generation college students, and members of under-represented groups will be trained in modern geochemical techniques. Results will be reported in conferences and peer-reviewed journals by students and researchers and introduced into college courses.<br/><br/>The goals of this proposal are to advance the knowledge of Li and K isotope geochemistry and lay the foundation for using K isotopes as a new tracer of chemical weathering and especially silicate weathering. The approach is to systematically investigate Li and K isotopic variations during chemical weathering and examine the processes and mechanisms that may produce isotopic fractionation by performing laboratory experiments and studying well-characterized natural samples. Combining the development and application of the K with Li isotopes as chemical weathering proxies is the first attempt to disentangle different controls of chemical weathering in both laboratory and natural settings. Following recent studies on Li and K isotopes as weathering tracers, the PI proposes to 1) determine Li and K isotopic variation in fresh Hawaiian basalts, weathered rocks, soils, streams and ground waters; 2) quantify the magnitudes and mechanisms of Li and K isotope fractionation during chemical weathering; and 3) investigate whether K isotopes can be combined with Li isotopes as chemical weathering tracers. The development of the Li and K isotope weathering proxy will greatly enhance the understanding of chemical weathering and its impact on different tectonic and climatic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our REU site is focused on technologies and methods for data analysis, and applications thereof. Our focus on data science allows students to participate in inherently interdisciplinary research that crosses a variety of fields, creating broad appeal for students with a diverse range of interests. Data science also opens numerous opportunities for engagement with industry, nonprofits, and government agencies. The REU allows students to gain expertise that makes them valuable contributors to research projects and sought-after candidates for many different types of positions in STEM fields once they finish their undergraduate degrees. <br/><br/>The objectives of this REU site are that students will (1) develop research skills in data analysis; (2) contribute to a substantive research project involving development of new methods for, or applications of, data analysis; (3) develop an appreciation and passion for research, as well as an understanding of what it is like to pursue graduate study in computing. In addition to the core research immersion in individual projects (often in teams with other REU students and graduate students), students also participate in various activities as a cohort, including a boot camp for technical and social orientation, an end-of-summer symposium with talks and posters, research skills seminars, meet-the-faculty events, and talks by industry speakers. Social events organized by the department and school, and facilitation of student social events further help to build cohort identity. The site specifically seeks to recruit students from colleges with limited opportunities for undergraduate research in engineering, and to address the underrepresentation of women through the computing pipeline. Students participating in the REU will: (1) be exposed to the many applications of data analytics across computer science, (2) gain expertise in specific technical skills and general research skills via their specific project, boot camp, and other ancillary activities, and (3) be equipped with a technical competitive advantage, knowledge, and motivation to pursue a research career in a STEM field. Students contribute to cutting-edge research in the analysis of large datasets, often published in top venues. Research topics range from using big data to combat homelessness, to drug design, to developing new parallel algorithms for processing large datasets.

These policies allow for soldiers to express their individual identities; however, they also challenge popular conceptions of soldiers, raising concerns and possible conflict. This project examines how larger trends of resocialization and accommodation play out in the day-to-day lives of new soldiers. The project investigates the experiences of incoming cadet candidates at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School in West Point (USMAPS). The project examines how USMAPS works to (re)socialize cadet candidates into soldiers and future officers, and how cadet candidates, whose civilian identities are constrained by a regimented institutional context, re-fashion personal self-definitions and routines.  The project will study how cadets interpret and respond to this re-socialization as they prepare for future military service.  The findings will contribute to understanding of how the military and other modern institutions socialize new participants to develop human capital suitable to new institutional roles.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project uses ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and quantitative text analysis to address questions regarding socialization into the military.  The fieldwork involves participating in cadet candidate academic, physical, character and military development training. The project will conduct over 100 interviews with cadet candidates from a variety of social backgrounds, as well as additional interviews with staff. The project will also include forty hometown visits to observe cadet candidate behavior outside of the institutional setting, to see their neighborhoods, and interview family members about how they perceive the cadet candidate career choices and any changes they have noticed in behavior.  The project also employs quantitative text analysis to study contemporary and historical documents related to the integration of women and minorities at West Point and in the U.S. military.  Project findings will contribute to sociological literatures on organizations, diversity and culture, particularly as they relate to re-socialization into critical U.S. institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many factors influence the growth of new blood vessels, including how much oxygen is available, the chemical signals present and the matrix (environment) through which these vessels are growing. Of these factors, the exact influence of the matrix is the least understood. Studying the influence of factors such as the stiffness and softness of the material, the size and organization of the pores and how these inter-related variables interact to guide vessel growth will enable a better-informed design of suitable porous materials and advance the field of tissue engineering. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project seeks to evaluate the growth of vessels in three dimensions within a variety of materials to map out the design space. A validated computer model will be developed to predict how vessels might grow in as yet untested porous materials. These outcomes will both accelerate the design of new tissue engineering solutions and potentially reduce the cost of their development by enabling rapid screening. Understanding how branching structures grow in nature and how things move through highly porous structures is critical to a variety of fields, including plant root growth in farming, tumors in cancer, natural gas extraction and chemical processing on catalysts. The project's complementary education plan is designed to engage underserved students in science and technical education and instill scientific curiosity in middle school students through hands-on experiments. Research community outreach will be achieved through the development of visualization workshops that will enable researchers to track particle movement through highly porous structures.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to generate a predictive rubric that enables the improved design of porous materials for tissue regeneration optimized for rapid vascularization. Models that determine vessel network patterns based on fluid mass transport are an invaluable first approximation, however their significant deviation from the randomness of natural vessel tree networks indicates that the impact of material/matrix mechanics needs to be further incorporated.  This project's Research Plan is designed to test the hypothesis that local matrix compliance affects vascular sprouting, while regional architecture affects growth, and global material compliance affects maintenance and inosculation (joining) of vascular networks. The information gained can be used to design biomaterials that can coax an angiogenic response instead of overwhelming the system with chemical stimuli.  The research methodology will involve developing composite materials, using imaging modalities to develop 3D architectural maps and using structural metrics and local mechanical properties as inputs to model vascularization outcomes.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to measure the specific impact of hydrogel compliance, density, crosslinking and temporal degradation on the vascularization of homogenous hydrogel systems.  Studies are designed to test the hypotheses that there is an optimal hydrogel compliance for any hydrogel system that best supports vascularization, that variation of molecular weight, fiber length, gel density and crosslinking can all independently modulate the compliance of the system and that vascular network formation is only possible when the time scale of vascularization is comparable to the time scale of degradation, i.e., when instantaneous regional matrix compliance meets the requirements needed to support vascularization.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to quantify the effect of scaffold pore size, stiffness and stromal cell seeding on vascularization responses within biphasic scaffold-hydrogel systems. Studies are designed to test the hypotheses that larger pore interconnections are better for enhanced vascularization, and that soft porous scaffolds will allow vascularization with longer segment lengths than rigid scaffolds and that the presence of stromal cells might impact vascularization interdependently with scaffold pore size since greater pore surface areas would result in greater stromal cell number and consequently a stronger vascularization signal.  The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to develop and validate a computational mechanics-based model to simulate vascular network formation in biphasic materials comprising a porous material with variable architecture and infiltrated with a hydrogel material permitting vascularization within the pores using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Studies are designed to test the hypotheses that development of vascularization over time in hydrogels is affected primarily by material density and global boundary conditions, while the vascularization of porous scaffolds containing hydrogels is significantly affected not only by the scaffold pore size (regional boundary), but also by the elastic modulus of the scaffold material.  The novelty of the project's approach lies in adding a mechanical perspective to existing knowledge on chemical and biological processes to understand mechanisms of vascularization and aid in the rapid exploration of any porous biomaterial for architectures suitable for tissue grafts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants will work individually or in teams with individual faculty members who guide them through a research experience. Weekly team-building and professional development activities take place, including an extensive guide to graduate school, and culminating in a poster session for all participants. The participants leave the program prepared to present their work at conferences nationwide and with a firm grasp of the benefits of graduate school as well as a timeline for applications to graduate school.<br/><br/>Undergraduates will participate in a diverse array of projects in mathematics, ranging from explorations in mapping class groups to topics in modern data science. All topics reflect important current trends in mathematics research. Many are strongly motivated by applications, ranging from architecture, to mixing of fluids, to modern signal analysis. For example, mapping class groups are built from the collection of all deformations of a surface. The object itself has additional structure, inherited from the surface, but expressed in an entirely different language. Those properties in turn yield insights into, for instance, how to most efficiently mix two types of very stiff fluids.

This project will examine how key traits vary with depth in common eelgrass (Zostera marina), one of the most important foundation species in temperate nearshore ecosystems worldwide. The investigators will use a combination of experiments in the field and lab, paired with fine-scale molecular analyses, to determine the genetic and environmental components of seagrass trait variation. This work will provide important information on the microevolutionary mechanisms that allow a foundation species to persist in a variable environment, and thus to drive the ecological function of whole nearshore communities. The Northeastern University graduate and Keene State College (KSC) undergraduate students supported by this project will receive training in state-of-the-art molecular techniques, as well as mentorship and experience in scientific communication and outreach. A significant portion of KSC students are from groups under-represented in science. Key findings of the research will be incorporated into undergraduate courses and outreach programs for high school students from under-represented groups, and presented at local and national meetings of scientists and stakeholders.<br/> <br/>Local adaptation, the superior performance of ""home"" versus ""foreign"" genotypes in a local environment, is a powerful demonstration of how natural selection can overcome gene flow and drift to shape phenotypes to match their environment. The classic test for local adaptation is a reciprocal transplant. However, such experiments often fail to capture critical aspects of the immigration process that may mediate realized gene flow in natural systems. For example, reciprocal transplant experiments typically test local and non-local phenotypes at the same (often adult) life history stage, and at the same abundance or density, which does not mirror how dispersal actually occurs for most species. In real populations, migrants (non-local) often arrive at low numbers compared to residents (local), and relative frequency itself can impact fitness. In particular, rare phenotypes may experience reduced competition for resources, or relative release from specialized pathogens. Such negative frequency dependent selection can reduce fitness differences between migrants and residents due to local adaptation, and magnify effective gene flow, thus maintaining greater within-population genetic diversity. The investigators will combine spatially paired sampling and fine-scale molecular analyses to link seed/seedling trait variation across the depth gradient at six meadows to key factors that may drive these patterns: local environmental conditions, population demography, and gene flow across depths. The team will then experimentally test the outcome of cross-gradient dispersal in an ecologically relevant context, by reciprocally out-planting seeds from different depths and manipulating relative frequency in relation to both adults and other seedling lineages. The possible interaction between local adaptation and frequency-dependence is particularly relevant for Zostera marina, which represents one of the best documented examples of the ecological effects of genetic diversity and identity. Further, a better understanding of seagrass trait differentiation is not simply a matter of academic interest, but critical to successful seagrass restoration and conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent studies suggest that evolution might also shape the way species interact over much shorter timespans, ranging from weeks to years.  Are these sorts of rapid feedbacks between evolution and ecology important in marine ecosystems?  This project will address this question along the Pacific coast of the United States by studying predatory snails (Channeled Dogwhelks) that feed on California Mussels, an important habitat-forming species on rocky intertidal shores.  Prior research shows that some dogwhelk populations are composed of an assortment of individuals that differ genetically in how effectively they can drill through mussel shells.  This project will test whether short-term changes in the environment can impose rapid natural selection that favors some of these drilling variants over others, altering the effects that a dogwhelk population has on the surrounding mussel bed.  At the same time, this project will examine whether regional differences in mussel shell thickness have influenced the evolution of drilling ability among dogwhelk populations distributed along >900 kilometers of the California and Oregon coasts.  Overall, this study seeks to understand the dynamic feedbacks between evolution and ecology that might influence marine communities in the face of changing ocean conditions.  This project will train diverse undergraduate and graduate students and will provide the foundation for a significant public outreach component, including the production of accessible video documentaries.<br/><br/>This project seeks to advance our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics in the sea by investigating links among oceanographic variation, natural selection, species interactions, and community succession.  This project will use the interaction between the Channeled Dogwhelk (Nucella canaliculata) and the California Mussel (Mytilus californianus) as a model system to address two central objectives. (1) The research team will explore how spatial mosaics of selection drive adaptive differentiation among populations of consumers.  Newly collected and archived mussels will be analyzed to characterize variation in shell thickness along the coasts of California and Oregon, and to evaluate whether this spatial mosaic has been consistent or variable over the past two decades.  Laboratory experiments will test whether dogwhelk populations distributed across this mosaic have diverged in the thickness of shell that they can drill successfully.  (2) The research team will examine whether temporal variation in selection on consumer phenotypes shapes predator-prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecological dynamics.  In particular, the project will test whether short-term variation in prey recruitment and shell thickness can impose rapid selection on the frequency of drilling phenotypes within a dogwhelk population.  A field experiment will also test whether selection on these predator phenotypes in turn alters the trajectory of mussel bed succession.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing studies of earlier cohorts of retirees do not fully capture the timing, sequencing, and voluntariness of short-term work-hour and workforce paths and transitions that Boomer men and women may experience. This project examines the experiences of women and men in their 50s, 60s, and 70s as they navigate later adulthood. The project assesses who is working longer, as well as the timing of exits from and reentries into employment. The project also examines whether these dynamics vary between advantaged and disadvantaged workers.  The project will assess whether working longer matters for the financial sustainability of individuals and their families, or the extent to which age-graded safety nets are effective.  Scientific advances from this work will inform the development of policy interventions promoting possibilities for working longer as well as for unpaid community engagement. These insights are key in light of the extraordinary numbers of Boomer women and men considering or undergoing labor market transitions moving them from social inclusion to social exclusion from the mainstream of society.<br/><br/>This project charts patterned short-term workforce constellations, capturing similarities and differences in sequencing and timing, for over 850,000 women and men ages 50 to 75 over eight time points. The project draws on linked Current Population Survey (CPS) monthly panel data from 1998 to 2018, with subsequent use of data from 2020. Individuals are surveyed in the CPS over a period of up to 16 months, which permits study of labor force entry and exists during that time frame.  Using sequence and multi-level analysis, the  project identifies the impacts of inequalities in patterned workforce constellations by social location, including variations by age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and nativity, in combination with geosocial locations. The project will capture the contemporary complexity, heterogeneity, and inequities in short-term 16-month work-hour/workforce and family living arrangement dynamics of Boomer women, men, and couples, examining similarities and differences in the experiences of Boomers and the cohort preceding them. The project will assess the predictive effects of resources such as prior health, income, and job tenure, combined with disadvantaged social statuses and geographical locations, on the likelihood of following particular workforce patterns, and whether these predictive effects differ by cohort and time period. The project will assess the relationship of patterned short-term work constellations to continuity and change in income levels, civic engagement, and shifting family living arrangements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project involves forward and reverse genetics, genome-wide proteomic and metabolic approaches, and live-cell imaging to understand how the growth and metabolism of rice blast fungus in host rice cells is facilitated and linked to host immune suppression. This could lead to the development of novel crop protection strategies targeting molecular pathways that are critical for the growth of the fungus but are not required for the normal function of the host cell, and could shed new light on both the basic principles of cell growth, and on the nature and regulation of host-microbe interfaces. The educational objectives will expand scientific education by stimulating undergraduates' science learning, preparing graduate students for scientific life beyond the university, and inspiring scientific interest in underrepresented high school students.<br/><br/>In order to cause plant disease, and in common with other plant-associated microbes, the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae initially forms intimate associations with living rice cells and grows for the first few days of infection as a symptomless biotroph, elaborating invasive hyphae (IH) wrapped in plant-derived membranes, acquiring nutrients and evading rice innate immune responses as it spreads cell-to-cell. After 3-5 days of infection, M. oryzae undergoes a lifestyle transition to necrotrophy, resulting in disease symptom development, host cell death and sporulation from leaf lesions. How M. oryzae controls the development of IH during the biotrophic growth phase while simultaneously evading or suppressing host innate immunity, and what triggers the transition to necrotrophy following the extended biotrophic growth phase, is almost entirely unknown at the molecular level. This project seeks to address these knowledge gaps by generating and characterizing mutants of M. oryzae that are unable to colonize host plant cells. This is expected to uncover novel cellular, biochemical, and genetic mechanisms governing rice infection. Results from the proposed work could point to novel sources of disease resistance, shed light on fundamental concepts of plant host-microbe interactions, and indicate how beneficial plant-fungal interactions might be promoted while those detrimental to crop health are diminished. The work will foster the molecular training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through active participation in tackling the real-world problem of rice blast disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal, the project will develop a service-learning curriculum that provides Scholars with opportunities to use their scientific knowledge to improve local communities.  It will also provide Scholars with evidence-based supports, including mentoring, career preparation, and research experiences.  Helping the Scholars attain their degrees will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians.  <br/><br/>The project has three specific objectives: (1) to enhance academic and co-curricular supports for Scholars so that at least 90% are retained through year two and 85% graduate with a STEM degree; (2) place 90% of Scholars into graduate programs or professional STEM positions within six months of graduation; and (3) generate and disseminate knowledge about the relationship between student service learning and persistence in a STEM major. Specifically, the project team plans to investigate if a service learning curriculum embedded into science courses and a three-week intensive service learning project improve student self-efficacy, sense of perceived academic value, and peer connectedness.  They also plan to investigate if these factors contribute to improved student graduation and progression into STEM careers.  Findings from this research should further illuminate the effects of service learning on student retention and graduation, contributing to understanding the spectrum of effective educational methods available in STEM undergraduate education.  This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Earth scientists recognize that the ability of rivers to erode depends on how much water is delivered to the mountains, and that changes between wetter or dryer climates should influence topography.  The expectation is that changes in climate and the resulting change in erosion are reflected in the topography of a landscape. This project focuses on the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, where deep canyons carved into the Central Andean Plateau margin reflect either tectonic uplift or an increase in erosional efficiency due to climate change. The research incorporates newly-developed methods for diagnosing the effects of climate on topography as part of a field-based investigation to determine the degree to which climate-driven changes in erosional efficiency are responsible for canyon cutting. New remote analysis methods are used to differentiate signatures of tectonic uplift driven erosion and climate driven erosion in topography. Improving the fidelity of these remote methods has considerable societal value because they are an inexpensive and efficient means of hazard assessment in areas where the presence or absence of tectonic uplift, and the resulting effect on seismicity, are uncertain. Additionally, this project wll benefit society by: 1) essential STEM training of three US graduate students including two women, as well as several Peruvian undergraduates; 2) international collaborations with both Peruvian and German universities; and 3) improved STEM education development in Peru and US at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels.<br/><br/>Determination of an active tectonic driver of mountain uplift and the geometry of related structures is critical to resolving how strongly climate and tectonics are coupled. This project tests competing hypotheses for the proximal drivers of canyon cutting into the Eastern Cordillera: incision driven by active rock uplift vs. incision into a previously uplifted plateau margin triggered by climate change. Integration of observations and analyses of the deformation history, landscape morphology, precipitation patterns, and spatial and temporal patterns of erosion and exhumation is used to definitively and quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of active rock uplift and climate change in landscape evolution. Analyses focus on: 1. estimating millennial-scale erosion rates from cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in modern river sands, 2. assessing the role of rainfall in the relation between topography and erosion rate, 3. analyzing cooling ages of low-temperature thermochronometers (AHe, AFT, ZHe) provided by a complementary study, 4. refining geologic mapping and developing balanced cross sections, and 5. integrating all data in models to quantitatively test hypotheses. Results will have broad implications for: 1. the general applicability and fidelity of proposed methods for diagnosing the primary causes of canyon cutting based on analysis of geomorphic data, 2. further development of a methodology to quantitatively link geometry, displacement and rates on faults to exhumation rates, erosion rate patterns and the resulting landscape morphology, 3. quantitative, observation-based understanding of the sensitivity of erosion rates to annual rainfall, and 4. understanding of the nature and strength of linkages among climate, topography, erosion, and tectonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interacting many-electron systems, such as those found in a great variety of materials, are distinguished in that they exhibit emergent behaviors and properties that do not manifest in systems comprised of only few particles. The resulting rich variety of phases of matter with wildly different physical properties, e.g. conducting vs. insulating, many forms of magnetism, etc., underlie important technological applications of solid-state materials. An organizing principle that has proven extremely successful for describing conventional phases of matter is based on the notion of symmetry. However, exotic phases of matter have been discovered recently that transcend conventional wisdom and which are enabled by quantum-mechanical effects and strong interactions. Examples include the fractional quantum Hall effect that occurs when electrons are confined in a plane in an external magnetic field, and liquid-like states of magnetic moments in magnetic materials. These new phases of matter have remarkably rich and ordered, in a sense, internal structure, which is termed ""topological order"".<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the theoretical understanding of topologically ordered phases. The PI will investigate how the interplay between symmetry and topological order gives rise to new quantum phenomena, by developing a theoretical framework to systematically study topological phenomena in the presence of symmetries and to characterize new quantum phases of matter enriched by symmetries. With these insights the PI will also explore new ways to probe topological order in experiments.<br/><br/>The project will achieve broad impact beyond the condensed matter community, as the research touches on problems that are of fundamental interest in related fields, such as high-energy physics and mathematics. Beyond research, the project will seek to enrich physics education in local communities with coordinated outreach activities. Through integration with the Pathways to Science program at Yale, the outreach activities supported by this project will provide opportunities to middle- and high-school students from underrepresented groups in physics and STEM-related fields, as well as to the general public, aiming to elucidate the physics underlying this research, and more broadly to promote awareness of cutting-edge research on quantum materials.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports research and education towards advancing fundamental understanding of quantum phases of matter in interacting many-body systems. In recent times, a synthesis between symmetry and topological order has brought new insights into the subject, unifying several important threads in the study of quantum matter. This research focuses on identifying the multifaceted roles of symmetries in exotic topological phases of matter and on characterizing universal quantum phenomena in these systems. The PI will use analytical methods supplemented by numerical simulations to tackle these problems. Specifically, this project has the following objectives:<br/><br/>1) Developing a theoretical framework for symmetry-enriched topological phases in fermionic systems. This includes a general classification of symmetry transformations on emergent excitations and potentially new quantum anomalies. Along the way, the PI will also investigate intrinsically interacting fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases in three dimensions, and will develop theoretical machinery to understand global phase diagrams around symmetric topological phases.<br/><br/>2) Developing a physical classification of gapped quantum field theories in three spatial dimensions, and characterizing quantum statistics of loop excitations. Another important aspect of this investigation is to advance new understanding of fracton topological phases by unraveling their deep connections to translation-symmetry-enriched topological order, with potential applications to spin liquid materials.<br/><br/>3) Investigating novel experimental probes of topological phases using dynamical measurements, building on the theoretical insights gained in this project. The PI plans to explore experimental signatures of symmetry fractionalization in dynamical and local measurements.<br/><br/>The project will achieve broad impact beyond the condensed matter community, as the research touches on problems that are of fundamental interest in related fields, such as high-energy physics and mathematics. Beyond research, the project will seek to enrich physics education in local communities with coordinated outreach activities.

Recent breakthroughs have demonstrated good clinical outcomes in a number of difficult-to-treat cancers, but response rates have been variable and many treatments result in unwanted side effects. Thus, there is an emerging interest in developing therapies that enhance the ability of the body's own Natural Killer (NK) cells, which are immune system cells that have the ability to recognize cancer cells and destroy them.  Unfortunately, tumors create a local environment, called the tumor microenvironment, that suppresses the functions of the NK cells and thereby allows the cancer to grow unchecked. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to engineer three-dimensional models of the tumor microenvironment and to interrogate the biochemical and mechanical cues that impact how NK cells migrate into tumors and recognize cancer cells. The knowledge generated by these studies could lead to new therapeutic targets or strategies for NK cells to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and attack cancer cells. The research project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary training at the cutting edge of tumor biology, immunology, and tissue engineering. The education goals of the project are to develop curricula and outreach activities that will excite students at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels about the impact of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professions on their local communities and society as a whole. In particular, outreach activities aimed at increasing awareness of the breath of opportunities that a STEM education provides will be targeted to middle school students and teachers in underserved and economically disadvantaged schools in north-central Florida.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop engineered tumor microenvironments to interrogate the biochemical and mechanical cues that impact Natural Killer (NK) cell migration and activity. Unlike T-cells, NK cells can function in an antigen independent manner by recognizing ""stress signals"" and alterations in cell surface ligands on nascent tumor cells that correspond to activating receptors on NK cells. Adoptive cell transfer of NK cells has demonstrated promise in eradicating certain hematological malignancies; however, solid malignancies have proved more challenging. To exert their effector functions in solid tumors, NK cells must migrate through the tumor stroma and make cell-to-cell contact with cancer cells. While much research is focused on enhancing NK cell activation at the NK cell-cancer cell synapse, without sufficient NK cell infiltration these strategies may ultimately be inefficient/ineffective. The first objective of the research plan is to engineer a tunable 3-D culture system to investigate how NK cell-ECM interactions impact NK cell recruitment. Various poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels will be engineered with tunable physical and biochemical properties such as stiffness, cell adhesion sites, enzymatic degradation sites, and tumor-related proteoglycans to interrogate the biochemical and mechanical cues that impact NK cell recruitment. The working hypothesis is that ECM composition and stiffness will impact NK cell migration and activation in response to chemotactic gradients. The extent of NK cell migration, the mechanism of migration, and cytokine production will be assessed in the engineered microenvironments. The second objective of the research plan is to characterize how the extracellular microenvironment impacts NK cell-cancer cell interactions. Tumor immunosuppression mechanisms and NK cell-cancer cell interactions will be examined in physiologically relevant 3-D systems. The working hypothesis is that the composition and stiffness of the ECM influences the immunosuppressive mechanisms in tumors and, consequently, NK cell-cancer cell interactions.  The results from these studies will advance the field of cancer immunotherapies and lead to new strategies for NK cell therapies in solid malignancies as well as new in vitro tools for evaluating their effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this goal for our REU scholars, the Ursinus REU site features three key components: i) important and accessible math and computer science research problems, ii) an Individual Development Plan (IDP), and iii) our commitment to serving underrepresented students. Participants will be a member of one of three research teams each consisting of three members and each led by a senior faculty.  Each team works on an original research project, chosen both for its importance and for its accessibility to undergraduate students.  Some projects continue for two years, while others are done in a single year to allow for more diverse topics and to expose REU scholars to new faculty. In addition to working on projects, we are intentional about fostering students' growth in their mathematical maturity and in their professionalism.  We will track student progress though the IDP. This plan assesses over the eight-week REU both the hard and soft skills needed for success in careers in the mathematical sciences. From ""ability to work in a team"" to ""mathematical knowledge,"" the IDP will help students to improve in their weak areas and challenge students to develop their strengths further. The IDP sets measurable goals and monitors progress before, during, and after the eight-week program on campus.  Finally, we commit in the REU program to including and giving opportunities to underrepresented students. The PI team will advertise to and recruit from schools local to the area, such as Community College of Philadelphia, with large populations of underrepresented students.  We will also advertise through professional organizations, such as NAM and Math Alliance. All Senior Personnel have a history of working with and mentoring underrepresented students, and they desire to continue to do so during the REU.<br/><br/>The REU research projects cover a diverse range of topics reflecting the expertise of the Senior Personnel. The REU will feature topology projects in both discrete Morse theory and computational topology with applications to music analysis, video analysis, and computer graphics. Our algebra projects explore partition identities, tame filling functions, and rainbow colorings. Another set of projects involves machine learning, with a focus on incremental language processing. Students of linear algebra have the opportunity to study everywhere surjective functions. In addition to their core research projects, students will be trained in mathematical writing and in presentation techniques through a series of weekly workshops designed to foster these essential communication skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these changes are associated with local human activities, and some are associated with broader climate changes. Increases in salinity are expected to have important impacts because many aquatic organisms evolved in and require low-salinity environments. Ecologists report that increases in salinity adversely affect some groups of aquatic organisms (e.g., aquatic insects such as mayflies, a focus of this project) that are ecologically important and serve as a primary food source for fishes and birds. Thus, modest increases in salinity could greatly affect both the biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. This project is designed to better understand how and why different aquatic insect species vary in their ability to thrive in waters of different salinity. The research will advance understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which salinity affects the metabolism, growth, and survival of aquatic insects, and, ultimately, their distributions and abundance. Project results will help local, tribal, state, and federal water resource agencies and their constituents and stakeholders better interpret monitoring data on aquatic insects, which are widely used as indicators of water quality and ecological conditions.  At least three graduate students and several undergraduate researchers will be supported and trained in the project, and the investigators will contribute to K-12 curriculum development related to water quality and ecological physiology.<br/><br/>The project will expose a new mayfly model species to short-term and long-term salinity gradients to establish how gene expression patterns, oxygen consumption, hemolymph chemistry, and gill physiology link to measures of fitness. Using comparative methods, the researchers will test the hypothesis that the efficiency of ion uptake in dilute environments and the ability to curtail excessive ion uptake in ion-rich environments are key osmoregulatory characteristics that can shape salinity niches. The investigators further hypothesize that the energetic costs of ion transport interact with temperature to influence growth, fecundity, and mortality to define species-specific salinity niches, the expression of which in nature can be observed from niche analyses of field survey data. The study will significantly advance understanding of how both natural variation in salinity and human-induced changes in salinity contribute to organismal performance and species distributions in an increasingly salty world. By integrating different levels of biological organization (genes to biodiversity patterns) and laboratory and field work, the project should significantly advance the synthesis of physiology and macroecology.

Just as the impression that our visual interpretation of the world around us is robust and complete, our impression of language is similarly rich. Behind the perceived ease of language understanding is a complex set of neuro-cognitive mechanisms that must work in tandem to give us a rich linguistic experience. However, these systems are not always foolproof and can be misled, arriving at unintended interpretations or the perception of ill-formed sentences as if they were well-formed. These errors trigger what are known as ""linguistic illusions"", and just as visual illusions have transformed our understanding of how our visual system interprets the world around us, the systematic study of linguistic illusions can transform our understanding of how we interpret language. Importantly, by studying the conditions under which we do and do not fall for linguistic illusions, we can improve language technologies, provide better language learning instruction, and aid in assessments of cognitive impairments.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to better understand the scope and cause of linguistic illusions. Current language processing models assume that illusions are the product of two distinct cognitive systems: one system for fast, efficient communication (the 'parser'), and another, slower system that classifies grammaticality (the 'grammar'). A competing account claims that illusions reflect a single grammar system embedded in a noisy cognitive architecture that creates the opportunity for errors. The current project addresses this debate by extending research to a broader set of linguistic phenomena using behavioral and computational methods to better understand the exact conditions that trigger illusions. This project will inform our understanding of (i) the cognitive architecture of language, (ii) the mental mechanisms for encoding, accessing, and manipulating sentence structures, and (iii) the role of the grammar in sentence processing. The project will have a direct impact on the broader scientific community, the undergraduate researchers funded through project, and the general public. Specifically, the project will expand the pool of participants that are typically included in psycholinguistic studies to non-college students, leading to a more comprehensive study of linguistic abilities across populations, and will bridge research and education by providing meaningful research experiences to undergraduate researchers, including under-represented minorities, through undergraduate training boot camps, research assistantships, and outreach activities at K-12 schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFCs) can utilize a wide range of fuels from pure hydrogen to readily available hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas and biogas. This project aims to generate new fundamental knowledge about a very important reaction involving hydrogen gas at the negative electrode of PC-SOFCs at temperatures relevant to operation. It also aims to develop new electrode materials that could further enhance the performance and robustness of PC-SOFCs. Knowledge from this project can be leveraged to other applications such as electrochemical energy storage, chemical production, and sensors. The project promotes education in advanced ceramic materials at Florida International University (FIU) and the broader southern Florida region through various education and outreach activities.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Despite the advantages of PC-SOFCs such as higher theoretical efficiency and potential for reduced degradation, many fundamental aspects are not known. This project aims to generate new knowledge about the very important hydrogen electrode reaction for PC-SOFCs using a combined set of technical approaches. For example, PC-SOFC button cells with patterned metal electrodes are used together with theoretical modeling to reveal the linkage between hydrogen electrode reaction kinetics and electrode geometry. Study of the impacts of fuel contaminants (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) help clarify the origins and the limitations of PC-SOFCs' intriguing electrochemical behaviors such as better sulfur tolerance. These studies also provide insights about the underlying hydrogen electrode reaction mechanism. On the other hand, new hydrogen electrode materials are designed via catalyst infiltration or exsolution techniques. Tailored doping of highly conductive oxides is being carried out to achieve mixed proton-electron conduction or better tolerance to fuel contaminant (e.g., carbon dioxide) for further improved PC-SOFCs. The education and outreach activities aim to raise awareness and interest, enhance access to related knowledge, and provide engagement in research for students (especially minority students), with these efforts centered around advanced ceramic materials. For example, video recording of lectures and important lab procedures are provided on the web. In addition, mobile social networks tools such as WhatsApp are actively adopted for communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, data-driven methods are becoming de rigueur nowadays, driving the need for increasingly sophisticated algorithms that find subtle statistical patterns in massive amount of data. This trend however is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, modern statistical learning methods help researchers in various fields to discover unexpected patterns from data and to make better decisions impacting everyday life. On the other hand, the rapid growth in the size and scope of data sets as well as the complexity of the methods used has made statistical models less transparent. Employing the derived models without a proper understanding of their validity can lead to many false discoveries, incorrect predictions and massive costs. For example, suppose the medical records of patients are used to develop a model for providing personalized risk score for a chronic disease. A high-risk score can trigger an intervention, such as incentive for healthy behavior, additional tests, and medical follow-ups which are all costly. This raises the concern about the validity of the outcomes retuned by this model. Should one interpret them at an average level or an individual level? Are the model predictions biased and, if so, how much? The overarching goal of this project is to develop novel foundational perspectives on the emerging inferential and computational challenges in statistics and data science. In addition, the PI plans to develop software packages to implement the proposed methods and make them publicly available. The proposed work will benefit a broad range of researchers from various areas ranging from bioinformatics and machine learning to finance and engineering. The PI will also integrate components from this project into an advanced graduate class and use selected results to motivate undergraduate students to pursue careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). <br/><br/>This project aims at developing statistical methods that are 1) scalable and 2) valid in the sense that in addition point estimation, they also quantify the statistical uncertainty that is intrinsic in the estimation and predications. These issues are among the central topics in modern statistics and it is imperative to develop solid theory and powerful methodology to address them. This project focuses on three interrelated prongs that develop fundamental insights for these ubiquitous challenges: (1) Uncertainty assessment and high-dimensional inference: the PI will develop a flexible framework for general hypothesis testing problems in high-dimensional setting using the so-called debiasing approach, and further study inference for high-dimensional models with adaptively collected samples, such as time series; (2) Online hypotheses testing: the PI will formulate the decentralized false discovery rate (FDR) control where the number of hypotheses to be tested is unknown (possibly infinite) and the decision maker should take an action on each before the next p-value is received; and (3) Optimal iterative estimation for non-linear decision regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, EMIS have benefitted from both volunteer geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourcing as powerful methods of collecting user-generated datasets. However, these data sources are challenging due to their very large size, variety, and update rates required to ensure the timely and accurate delivery of useful emergency information and response for disastrous events. Developing fundamental data processing components for advanced relevant queries which can clearly and succinctly deliver critical information in the case of an emergency is critically important and challenging. This research focuses on three interrelated domains: 1) evacuation route planning 2) resource assignment, and 3) transportation resilience. This research investigates innovative queries in these three domains in the context of emergency management. The outcome of this project has potential benefit to a wide range of societal applications, such as transportation management, logistics, public safety, resource assignment, and service delivery and thus aligns well with the NSF mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare . Educational objectives of this project include broadening participation of Hispanic women, increasing undergraduate research opportunities including research-intensive course development, and promotion of team science skills. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to identify promising solutions for addressing the challenge of EMIS and to develop an advanced spatial query processing platform that clearly and succinctly delivers critical information in emergencies. First, this project designs and develops the problem-solving framework that can integrate different technical components, including geometry, topology, graph theory, and optimization techniques. Second, this project investigates multiple inherent constraints for spatial networks and identifies main bottlenecks for query processing. Third, this project develops fast and scalable query processing mechanisms that overcome these bottlenecks and produce simple and concise information for emergency management. A key research challenge is to identify structural patterns or optimal substructures of the spatial network optimization problem that can enhance the scalability and efficiency of spatial network query processing. The components of the query processing framework include frequent suffix tree mining, graph simplification, bi-partite graph clustering, minimum polygon covering, graph partitioning, spectral method, random walk, and expander graph mining. These components are integrated to develop fast and scalable spatial network queries and to provide simple and concise information for EMIS. The outcomes of this project include data processing tools, spatial and spatial network optimization algorithms, queries, and visualization tools. This project validates the performance of new spatial network queries using historical and real-time datasets and provides a web-based educational system to enhance student learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses basic social and environmental questions regarding the development of early agrarian civilizations, and the social and physical landscapes they engendered and in which modern societies continue to live. Interdisciplinary studies featuring collaboration between archaeologists, geographers and earth scientists are particularly well-suited to apply deep time perspectives to the role of long-term environmental change, and thereby assess competing explanations for early urban collapse, as exemplified in the Southern Levant and witnessed repeatedly elsewhere. Understanding possible trajectories and potential impacts of ancient environmental change holds major implications for understanding how and why the earliest urban civilizations rose and collapsed. Accordingly, this research illuminates the often-precarious relationships between agrarian societies, both ancient and modern, and their ecological settings. This project takes great pride in the training of young female scholars in archaeology and geography. Among the five principal collaborators on this project, four are women, including two early career female assistant professors, one of whom is of Hispanic descent. This project will continue to recruit students from underrepresented groups and provide opportunities that broaden their participation in science through multiple avenues. <br/><br/>In close collaboration with their research team, Drs. Falconer and Fall will evaluate several competing scenarios to explain the strikingly pervasive and lengthy abandonment of the earliest Levantine cities 2500-2000 BC, and their rapid and dramatic reemergence immediately thereafter. This study features a controlled comparative analysis of environmentally-sensitive evidence excavated from four strategically-selected Bronze Age communities along the Jordan Rift: two in the northern Jordan Valley, Jordan and two lying just east of the Dead Sea Basin. Each pair of excavated sites includes a village occupied during urban abandonment (2500-2000 BC) and a village inhabited during the rebirth of cities (2000-1600 BC). <br/>Fine-grained radiocarbon dating of carbonized seeds will provide high precision chronologies for these sites. Coordinated analyses of stable isotopes from crop seeds, and animal bones and teeth will be used to estimate ancient rainfall and temperatures through time. Changing profiles of cultivated crops and herded animals will portray shifting human responses to environmental change. The analytical results from our four sites will be compared to infer trends of environmental change, both chronologically and geographically. Resulting trajectories of environmental change between 2500 and 1600 BC will be used to assess competing hypotheses to explain Levantine urban collapse. In sum, this research will contribute to the growing discussion of environmental dynamics at the heart of ancient social change with timely pertinence for human responses to environmental change in the modern world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Pacific Northwest LSAMP (PNWLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Washington.  The ten public institutions that make up the Alliance are diverse and include five four-year institutions and five partnering community colleges.  The institutions are Boise State University, Oregon State University, Portland State University, the University of Washington, Washington State University, the College of Western Idaho, Linn-Benton Community College, Seattle Central Community College, Yakima Valley Community College, and Portland Community College.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 50% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by continuing successful programming from previous years while expanding its focus on leadership and mentorship.  This new program will include professional development, opportunities to participate in program operations, serve as mentors, and have access to faculty mentorship.  This focus will support LSAMP students in developing their scientist identity and self-efficacy through engagement in the culture of science and discussion of the role of race and social stigma in scientific training.  PNWLSAMP will also increase the number of URM students from Alliance institutions pursuing graduate education by 5-10% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""<br/><br/>The educational research study will take an assets-based and intersectional approach, examining factors that contribute to persistence in STEM for students from URM groups.  The research project will include a large multi-year study and four smaller ""sprint studies"" conducted by researchers across the Alliance.  The large study will examine how STEM students from URM groups navigate within historically exclusionary social institutional structures.  It will also include a participatory action element that engages students and administrators to develop strategies for improving equity on their campuses.

The benefits of serverless computing are offset, however, by new software development challenges arising from mitigation of resource constraints employed by cloud providers to share physical servers among many users, and by the complexity of understanding performance and cost implications of software designed for serverless platforms.  This project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science, and to promote national prosperity and welfare by developing a reusable framework enabling new data driven analytics and evaluation techniques that characterize the quality of software designed for serverless computing platforms.  These advancements serve to extend the applicability of serverless computing to a broader range of use cases enabling the next generation of cloud software to realize performance improvements and cost savings. This project additionally leverages the simplicity of serverless computing to develop an online hour-of-code tutorial to introduce cloud computing, client/server, and distributed systems concepts to high school students for dissemination.<br/><br/>This research develops the Serverless Application Analytics Framework (SAAF), a novel framework that supports the characterization of software deployed to serverless computing platforms enabling the collection of resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk/network I/O), infrastructure (type, state, and distribution), load balancing, and performance metrics.  SAAF enables an improved understanding of several factors that impact performance.  This research develops predictive models using statistical and machine learning approaches to automate the characterization of performance and hosting cost of serverless software leveraging metrics from SAAF, and software quality metrics from static analysis tools as features.  SAAF enables identification of best practices over serverless architectures (monolithic, composable, and RESTful APIs), software composition patterns (monolithic, fine grained, library composition, and switchboard), and workflow instrumentation (remote client, vendor service, microservice controller, and asynchronous call chains).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A Heritage Language (HL) is a first language (L1) that has become a non-dominant language for its speakers because of its minority status. The question asked in this project is whether a heritage language (HL) behaves like a first language (L1) because an HL is learned as a native language, or if a heritage language (HL) behaves like a second language (L2) because it is underdeveloped like an L2. In order to test this, this study investigates the grammatical and lexical processing in Vietnamese-English bilinguals. Vietnamese, a heritage and minority language in the United States, is the fourth most spoken language outside of English (U. S. Census Bureau, 2015). This shows how prevalent HL speakers are in this country, and yet, there is a limited amount of research conducted on HL processing.<br/> <br/>Many bilingual language processing models, such as the Bilingual Interactive Activation model (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002; van Heuven, Dijkstra, & Grainger, 1998) and the episodic L2 hypothesis (Jiang & Forster, 2001; Witzel & Forster, 2012), were proposed based on evidence from bilinguals with a dominant L1 and less-dominant L2. Little is known about the processing of a non-dominant L1. The first portion of this study examines grammatical processing in HL speakers. A preliminary study compared grammatical processing in HL Vietnamese speakers to L1 Vietnamese-dominant speakers. Findings from this study suggest that HL speakers and L1-dominant speakers decompose L1 Vietnamese compound words in a very similar manner. To further investigate whether an HL is processed like an L1 or an L2, a follow-up study testing morphological decomposition in L2 English is proposed. The second portion of this study examines lexical processing in these speakers. L1 dominant bilinguals have reliably shown that L1 words automatically activate their respective L2 translations. However, it is unclear what happens to bilinguals whose dominant language has switched from their L1 to their L2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flow separation occurs when fluid flow past an object (e.g., wing of an aircraft) abruptly ""detaches"" from the surface.  A swirling motion, called wakes or vortices, is then formed in the separated region which result in increasing the fluid drag force on the object. Flow separation is unwanted and can seriously reduce performance of engineered devices such as aircraft and turbines. The use of high-resolution numerical simulations will permit the advancement of more efficient turbulence models. Such models will facilitate the development of flow, heat, and contaminant transport control tools to mitigate unwanted flow separation effects. The proposed research and educational objectives will be carried out at a Hispanic Serving Institution, located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The educational component of this project promotes the use of high-performance computing, computational thinking, and modeling. Such concepts will be introduced to undergraduate and graduate courses using flipped classroom concept. The post-processed data and resulting codes will be made accessible to the public for analysis and validation. Additionally, a computing and visualization facility will be developed as a tool for research, learning, and outreach in departmental Summer Camps for K-12 students and teachers. <br/>  <br/><br/>The principal aim of this study is to numerically elucidate the details behind passive scalar phenomena during boundary layer separation, resulting from the two most frequent causes of flow detachment: streamwise and wall-curvature driven pressure gradient, in combination and isolated forms. The study will cover nearly the entire spectrum, particularly in the near wall region, where experimental techniques and turbulence models exhibit severe limitations. By identifying and tracking Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and exploring the relationship between LCS kinematics and passive scalar fields, it may be possible to accurately explain the separation process. These research efforts will apply the use of tremendous computational resources, requiring state-of-the-art petascale, parallel and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) programming. Specific objectives include i) perform Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of spatially-developing turbulent boundary layers under strong deceleration at experimental Reynolds numbers, ii) understand the transport phenomena in the separation process by means of low/high order statistics analysis and create an LCS data bank along with iOS/Android apps for augmented/virtual reality, iii) develop a unique data-driven modeling of sub-grid scale (SGS) in Large Eddy Simulation (LES), focusing on the uncharted area of passive scalar.

This change represents more than a technological shift because it impacts employment and economic organization in several parts of our country.   Energy transport infrastructures play a key role in the design and re-design of energy systems by making it possible to scale up such systems, thus more fully  and efficiently using new energy sources.  Because of these several changes, public conversations about the best ways to access new energy sources provide important information regarding the implications of change in energy sources, particularly the issues of transporting new energy sources to consumers.  This project will analyze these public conversations to assess their dynamics as well as their economic and social impacts. Analysis of these cases will help us to understand how these values and visions of the future can become materially embedded through the decisions made around which infrastructures are built. Findings from the project will inform how transitions in the energy industry evolve and are managed by specific communities and by our society more generally, thus informing policymakers at several levels who are responsible for policy governing energy creation, regulation and usage.<br/><br/> <br/>This project investigates the public and policy conversations surrounding three energy related infrastructure proposals that cover energy transportation.  This project relies on a multi-methods approach combining 65 semi-structured in-depth interviews of key stakeholders, content analysis of over 30 local and national newspapers, and key policy and archival materials from regulatory agencies, industry partners, and social movement organizations. Interviews will focus on collecting descriptive accounting and stakeholder perceptions of the events, formal review processes, and subsequent conversations around each proposed project in order to analyze why and how each project was evaluated, discussed, and how competing visions of energy creation and usage were resolved and evolved. Through media content analysis, the project will understand how each project was regionally framed and therefore how these media frames converged with or deviated from those advocated by individual stakeholders and stakeholder groups, across time and the energy cases. The archival document content analysis will shed light on how the federal and state regulatory structures and policy regimes have shaped each discussion. Through this comparative case study of energy infrastructure projects, this project will construct the emerging conversations around and evaluations of the different energy regimes present in our society today.  Findings will inform sociological theories regarding energy usage, community transformation, and social change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of mission-critical structures that experience high-rate dynamics include hypersonic vehicles, space crafts, ballistics packages, and active blast mitigation. Enabling real-time decision-making for these structures increases mission success rates by enhancing the structure's survivability, providing on-time guidance corrections, and adopting the mission goals/outcome to changing conditions. Additionally, the methodologies developed by this project increase the robustness, safety, and commercial viability of structures operating in extreme dynamic environments. The development of algorithms and methodologies for structures experiencing high-rate dynamics serves the national interest and fulfills the NSF's mission:  to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.  This project provides research experience and mentors a diverse and inclusive group of students, and introduces a graduate level class on surrogate modeling of complex systems.<br/><br/>A structural system operating in a high-rate dynamic environment can experience sudden and unmodeled plastic deformation of the structure that may further lead to damaged electronics, sensors, and/or delicate payloads. This research focuses on enabling a real-time decision-making module to take corrective actions. To achieve this goal, a parallelization framework is developed that enables a structural system to be decomposed into its constituent components where each component can be monitored, modeled, and extrapolated into the future. Once the degradation trajectories for each component have been estimated, they are recombined into a single system-level model to be used for real-time decision making.  The project is organized into two research thrusts and one experimental design challenge. Thrust 1 investigates surrogate modeling techniques with the goal of developing component-level models that can converge within the required time constraints. These surrogate models use data obtained from dense sensor networks to generate data-driven damage-sensitive features that can be used as the degradation parameters for component-level prognostics. Thrust 2 explores and formulates methodologies for real-time component-level prognostics. These component-level predictions are then recombined into a single structural model that is used to develop potential corrective actions. Lastly, the experimental design challenge validates the developed algorithms and methodologies using a high-rate dynamic test bench.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These words (e.g. this and that), known in linguistics as demonstratives, are typically used to focus the hearer's attention on entities in the speech situation. Over time, some of these words evolve and may develop various kinds of new functions such as connectives and hesitation signals. Despite the universality of demonstratives across languages, demonstratives differ in how they change and why they evolve in certain ways. Although demonstratives have long been a key research topic in linguistics, we know surprisingly little about how demonstratives and demonstrative-derived pragmatic markers are used in spontaneous face-to-face conversation. This is due to the fact that the most commonly used genres in linguistic analysis are written discourse and oral narratives rather than spoken discourse. The results and transcriptions will help applied linguists and L2 educators develop more effective materials for teaching Mandarin Chinese, a critical language designated by the U.S. government. The project database will enhance the infrastructure for language-related research and education, and will contribute to the training of students.  <br/><br/>This dissertation project recognizes the methodological limitations in previous text-based analyses and investigates how the distal demonstrative na 'that' is used in Mandarin Chinese everyday conversation from a discourse-pragmatic perspective. Apart from its canonical usage as a distal demonstrative, na has various kinds of extended and nuanced discourse functions. This project sets out to identify and classify different uses of na, with a special focus on its previously overlooked non-referential discourse pragmatic functions. More specifically, it will uncover sequential contexts, functional accounts, and positions of na using both a quantitative approach and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to offer a systematic analysis that accounts for all the occurrences and functions of na by speakers in actual everyday conversation. The secondary goal is to shed light on a better understanding of robust similarities and subtle language specific variations in the grammaticalization and/or pragmaticalization of demonstratives, particularly the non-deictic uses of pragmatic markers derived from demonstratives.

The Bioarchaeology of Bronze Age Social Systems REU program supports a diverse pool of nationally recruited undergraduates engaged in the entire research process from hypothesis formation to data collection, analysis, public outreach, and publication. Teams of students collaborate with an interdisciplinary group of dynamic scientists and professionals while conducting original research on two Bronze Age skeletal collections, examining how alternative pathways to social complexity during an increasingly globalized Bronze Age were embodied in the human skeleton and reflected in mortuary practices. Many of these bioarchaeological methods have applications to forensic anthropology as well, and by illustrating their utility and accuracy, students may contribute to advancing the use of more accurate demographic techniques in contemporary criminal cases involving commingled remains. Students also receive training on how to effectively disseminate their research results to both academics and the broader public all while engaging in discussions surrounding the ethics of working with human remains. Participants similarly receive mentorship in professional development via guest scientists and with established summer undergraduate research workshops at the University of South Alabama. Prior to conference presentations, students engage with members of the local community to share their project findings using weekly blogs, social media posts, posters, and digital stories. <br/><br/>This project focuses on two large skeletal collections dating to 2700-2000 BCE. These Bronze Age communities did not develop highly stratified social systems, but instead maintained tribal, kin-based systems of social organization. Subsequently, an analysis of these skeletons presents a unique opportunity for an in-depth examination of the socioeconomic, political, and environmental circumstances in which so-called peripheral populations resisted stratification, adapted to environmental change, and negotiated their own identities. Students collaborate with top scholars and use innovative techniques well-suited to the challenges of working with commingled collections to answer questions about changing mortuary practices and human lifeways in this region, but also to more broadly compare these social trajectories to paths of complexity taken elsewhere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early research typically treated technology as applied science with a predetermined developmental trajectory that predicted specific outcomes. Recent work contradicts this, suggesting that technologies and their structures are the result of complex social dynamics between producers, consumers, and other members of a society with a vested interest, often leading to conflict, cooperation, and compromise. These interactions produce unique and materially traceable patterns of specialization, organization, and consumption. Archaeology, with a material dataset spanning millennia, is well suited to studying the material aspects of these phenomena. When supported by ancient textual records, as in the case of the present research, it is also possible to investigate the social dynamics behind the material record, allowing researchers to look at the tension between what people say (texts) and do (material remains), which often reveals information about social ideals and the limits of power. Over the long-term, how do different societies come to terms with new and complex technological suites? Today, as societies grapple with the unforeseen consequences of technologies like the internet, labor automation, and machine learning, the importance of this question is clear - new technologies often do not have straightforward and predictable effects, and different groups, based on their unique priorities, will structure them differently and use them to meet a wide variety of goals. <br/><br/>Mr. Johnson and his collaborators will examine how metallurgical technologies were practiced, managed, and perceived during a crucial transformative period where metallurgy underwent a shift from a small-scale elite craft to a complex industry that facilitated the development of wealth-based economies and increased productive capacity, thereby laying part of the foundation for the formation of large territorial empires. Working with material scientists, geologists, and archaeologists, Mr. Johnson will utilize methods developed in the STEM disciplines to analyze metallurgical debris excavated from the ancient city of Alalakh in southern Turkey. As the capital of a small state with a diverse economic base that was frequently subservient to much larger regional powers, Alalakh is an ideal setting for studying these developments. Through these analyses, the researchers will develop a comprehensive assessment of metallurgical technologies in use over a 400-year period (1600-1200 BC), during which the production of iron was mastered and the manufacture of copper reached a truly industrial scale. Considered in reference to local and regional textual records and their archaeological contexts, the evaluation of these data will permit a thorough assessment of changing methods of production, management, and consumption at a local level and how these trends supported broader social developments. Using a robust interdisciplinary program, Mr. Johnson and colleagues will generate a more thorough protocol for the integration of STEM and humanities datasets, while the international nature of the collaboration with create a valuable venue for cross-cultural teaching and exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, scientific data analysis requires a significant amount of time. To decrease the amount of time needed to analyze data, methods need to utilize more computational resources, such as more processors in a computer. While the central processing unit (CPU) in a modern computer has traditionally been used to carry out data analysis, the past decade has seen an increase in using graphics processing units (GPUs) for data analysis. The modern graphics processing unit contains thousands of processors that can be used to execute a program faster than on the CPU. However, many algorithms for data analysis do not use the GPU to its full potential within the context of the broader computer system. This project advances a framework for understanding the performance of GPUs as applied to data analysis applications. The major goal of the project is to bridge the gap between algorithms that only use the GPU, and fully integrated algorithms that exploit the strengths of both the CPU and GPU. The ensemble of algorithms that are explored in the project support the needs of the astronomy community and researchers in other scientific areas that require efficient data analysis methods. The project aims to realize a new era in CPU/GPU computing that impacts both computer science and other scientific fields.  An outcome of the project is the development of materials for educators teaching at the intersection of data analysis and parallel computing. This project includes mentoring K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Consequently, the project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science, and to advance the national health and prosperity. <br/><br/>New cyberinfrastructure, such as data analysis algorithms for emerging heterogeneous architectures, are needed to address cutting-edge scientific problems. Data analysis building blocks and algorithms have many data-dependent performance bottlenecks. New architectures have the potential to alleviate some of these key bottlenecks. However, the majority of GPU research minimally involves the CPU/host, and performs most of the computation on the GPU. This is a missed opportunity to more closely integrate both data and task parallelism between the CPU and GPU to simultaneously exploit concurrency across both architectures. This project examines a selection of key algorithms in the database, machine learning, data mining, and parallel computing communities. Using these algorithms, this project explores the continuum between GPU-only and mixed hybrid parallelism (data and task parallelism between the CPU and GPU) to identify key bottlenecks that can be reduced by exploiting underutilized resources. The selected algorithms are fundamental to scientific data processing workflows, and can advance time-domain astronomy cyberinfrastructure.  The project integrates data-intensive computing insights into courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and pedagogical modules are developed to be used by instructors for teaching concepts of mixed (data and task) parallelism across the CPU and GPU. This project includes mentoring students at the undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 levels, including outreach at science festivals to encourage participation and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A multi-year, multi-site, and multi-method constructivist approach to grounded theory research will be utilized with primary data obtained from intensive interviews with critical incident and symbolic interactionist emphasis. The comparative and iterative synthesis of coded and emergent data obtained from a cohort of undergraduate AEC women from five institutions over a four-year period will provide a longitudinal understanding of why and how their views and actions change with their lived experiences across educational stages. Methodological triangulation methods of data include textual analysis of formal documents and open-ended question surveys. Emergent theories from the research will inform practical implementation of the PDCP and the EBWE center and subsequent findings will provide greater insights into research findings. The construction of robust discipline-specific PID process theories will bridge gaps in identity and diversity theories and inform transformations for more gender inclusive AEC educational and institutional environments, which will enhance the early awareness, attraction, preparation, and persistence of the next generation of women AEC professionals.

The project will support the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need in partnership with The City College of New York's Grove School of Engineering. Over five years, this project will fund up to 110 annual scholarships. Each scholarship will provide a full year of financial support for up to four years of study, including up to two years at Hostos Community College and up to two years at the Grove School of Engineering. The project will increase the impact of the scholarship support by providing Scholars with mentoring by faculty and near-peers and ensuring that the Scholars take full advantage of available resources and professional development opportunities that are associated with student success. These resources include: 1) writing across disciplines in the STEM curriculum; 2) mentored immersive undergraduate research experiences; 3) guidance and support for transfer to a four-year institution; 4) exposure to STEM-related working and professional facilities; 5) participation at professional STEM conferences; and 6) career orientation workshops and other professional development opportunities. <br/><br/>This project builds on the previous NSF-funded ""Bridges to Engineering Success for Transfers"" Program that helped to establish a Joint Dual Engineering Degree Program between Hostos Community College and the Grove School of Engineering.

Interpretations of Mesopotamian society, heavily influenced by the written record, have often interpreted the earlier level where the archaeological record is dominated by public buildings, as a very top down society, with some suggesting that much of the population were comparable to chattle slaves.  However, the subsequent period is best known for its domestic areas which have yielded private letters and contracts and testify to considerable agency on the part of the larger population.

With considerable technological advancements, it is a pivotal time to harness the intensive data collected in space and time to benchmark precision agriculture systems worldwide. The recent launch of groups of satellites designed to work together -- known as ""satellite constellations"" -- opens up unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize precision agriculture, through monitoring the crop phenological progress at fine spatial and temporal scales. However, the gigantic amount of data brings significant challenges to conventional remote sensing software and tools. The overarching goal of this project is to prototype advanced remote sensing cyberinfrastructure in support of both data- and compute-intensive satellite-based precision agriculture systems. This advanced cyberinfrastructure is applicable to a diverse range of agricultural systems, especially for resource poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems. With its potential to improve global farming practices, the cyberinfrastructure helps optimize the trajectory of agricultural development to meet future crop demands as well as lower environmental impacts. The integrated educational and training activities of the project offer unique learning opportunities to students of various academic levels and backgrounds, and enhance the broader engagement of diverse scientific communities, especially minority and underrepresented groups. Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The advanced remote sensing cyberinfrastructure focuses on the development of an innovative real-time phenological computational (RTPC) model and a high-performance system to harness massive parallelism in modeling crop phenological progress towards scalable satellite-based precision farming. The RTPC model integrates dynamic complex networks with time series remote sensing, and is unique to predict the real-time crop phenological progress at both fine spatial and temporal scales. The high-performance system enhances the parallelism of the RTPC using a hybrid computation model, including a node-level computation model and a system-wide data distribution model. The node-level computation model takes advantage of multi-core architecture of computing nodes to parallelize the compute-intensive RTPC in predicting dynamic network characteristics of crop phenology. The system-wide data distribution model devises a novel Space-and-Time parallel decomposition strategy in distributing massive remote sensing time series data to reduce memory requirements and to achieve high scalability. An open-source toolkit is designed to facilitate the open development and adoption of the remote sensing cyberinfrastructure across a broad range of disciplines. Through leveraging the power of high performance computing and this hybrid computation model, the cyberinfrastructure can analyze PB-level remotely sensed data in a highly scalable manner to conduct real-time monitoring of earth system dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The capability and usability of the meshing framework are evaluated by investigating fabrication of objects with internal microstructures and construction of anisotropic volumetric models to capture the organ and tissue shape. This work has the following primary components: (1) Computing high-dimensional geometric embedding based on Nash theorem in parallel: the computational realization of high-dimensional geometric embedding makes modeling complex objects with multiple tensor features being built and solved in parallel in a large linear system. (2) Modeling multi-shape of mesh element in a unified particle framework: the particle system flexibly and effectively generates high-quality honeycomb, tetrahedral, and hexahedral (grid) patterns, which are exactly designed for meshing structure.

The India-Asia collision is the premier example of this happening today. The collision has produced the Tibetan Plateau, the region with the highest topography in the world, as well as deformation resulting in earthquakes and volcanic activity throughout eastern Asia affecting over a billion people. Despite more than 150 years of research on the topic, the evolution of the crust and mantle (lithosphere) beneath the Tibetan Plateau remains an enigma. There is surprisingly little agreement on the configuration of where Indian lithosphere is beneath Tibet and thus little agreement on the processes driving plateau uplift and growth as well as the evolution of the mantle beneath. This proposal is to develop a comprehensive high-resolution P and S wave seismic image of the crust and mantle beneath Tibet and surrounding regions. The goal is to better understand the dynamics of crust-mantle evolution during continental collision. This work will help in understanding past continental collisions and thus provide a better understanding of the geology of continents and the occurrence of natural resources. In the past 500 years more than one million people lost their lives in earthquakes within the study area of this project. The detailed lithospheric structures to be imaged in this work will improve our understanding of seismicity in this vast tectonically active zone of continental collision.  This work involves international collaborations with scientists in China and India, as well as training of graduate and undergraduate students at collaborating institutions in the US and internationally.<br/><br/>Seismic images will be developed through the application of full waveform inversion of three component regional broadband data that sample the crust and mantle beneath Tibet. The investigators will also incorporate teleseismic travel-time measurements and receiver functions in their model development. A large regional waveform database will be created using all available stations within and around the Tibetan plateau, taking full advantage of the enormous resources that have been dedicated to studies of Tibet in the past. Based on prior experience the team expects to be able to constrain structures with dimensions on the order of 50 km, both laterally as well as vertically. Their main goal is to map the Indian continental lithosphere (ICL) from northern India to regions below the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. The investigators expect to be able to make relatively precise estimates of the thickness of the mantle lithosphere beneath northern India and various parts of Tibet and the surrounding regions. This should put constraints on thickening of the Indian mantle lithosphere as well the location of a possible transition from very thick Indian cratonic lithosphere to thinner Indian continental marginal  lithosphere. Further goals will be to see if any instabilities can be imaged at the base of either the Indian or Tibetan lithosphere, and if and where Indian lithosphere is descending into the deeper mantle. Descent of cratonic lithosphere into the deeper mantle has implications for the permanence of cratonic mantle. With accurate P and S images, as well as improved transition zone discontinuity depths, the team hopes to distinguish chemical and thermal anomalies in the deeper mantle beneath Tibet. Using a full 3D image of the upper mantle in this region, they should also be able to see whether the colliding Indian lithosphere is segmented at depth and exhibits variable behavior along strike of the collision. Finally, they hope to place constraints on the behavior of the Tibetan lithosphere and determine whether there is any evidence for southward subduction of Eurasian lithosphere and whether any of the original Tibetan lithosphere been delaminated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the study of ADE has demonstrated its importance in the development of complex societies before the arrival of Europeans, there have yet to be any significant studies concerning the transformations of ADE during European colonization of the Amazon. Researchers will collect and analyze samples of ADE soils at the Carrazedo site, located at the confluence of the Xingu and Amazon Rivers, to examine the processes and causes behind transformations of ADE between precolonial, colonial, and modern occupations of the site. This study will provide ecological and anthropological knowledge concerning both the transformations of ADE soils and the political economies associated with their production. The rupture caused by colonialism in this region presents an ideal opportunity to identify the ways in which ADE production, which was originally geared towards subsistence agriculture, transformed to meet the needs of emerging capitalism. Within the Carrazedo community, this project will help to foster greater appreciation of the community's archaeological past, will provide incentive to protect the archaeological site from future development, will contribute to the development of a community-based tourism project at the site, and will provide archaeological training to both community members and undergraduate students. The project also holds great potential towards the ongoing development of productive, yet sustainable strategies for rural agriculture in the Amazon. As the project fine tunes the analyses of the complexities of ADE variability, farming communities may harness this knowledge and benefit from the greater production that high fertility levels of ADE have to offer. Opportunities for less deforestation and greater carbon sequestration also make the study of ADE an important avenue for greater sustainability in the Amazon.<br/>	<br/>Researchers of this project will address questions concerning the chemical, physical, and cultural variability of ADE between precolonial, colonial and modern occupations of the site. Specifically, this study will seek to understand both the intentionality behind ADE production, and the transformation of this traditional ecological knowledge over time. Were these soils being reproduced after the arrival of Europeans? Or were the techniques and knowledge of ADE production lost as a result of colonialism? This study will answer these questions by conducting excavations and collecting soil samples within various activity areas that cover a broad spatial and temporal scope of the site with the intention of understanding the incremental and systematic changes to ADE. Once collected, these samples will be analyzed in order to understand their chemical, physical, and cultural components. These results will then be integrated with findings from archival research in order to gain insight to the nature of historic strategies for agricultural production and community patterning in the greater Xingu-Amazon region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Irrigation megaprojects in arid landscapes feature prominently in agricultural development worldwide. Planning and policy entities often focus on the economic benefits of irrigation water for farmers. However, irrigated soils are often central to ecological and social conflicts that follow the construction of irrigation districts. Such conflicts include reduced soil quality, water contamination via agricultural runoff, and displacement of regional farmers by investors' large land acquisitions. Therefore, this research will investigate the social and ecological effects of irrigation megaprojects and the related governing policies and practices of irrigation water and soils. This research will contribute to scholarly and policy considerations of social-environmental feedbacks in governance. The broader impacts of this project will (1) work toward improved irrigation infrastructure development, (2) strengthen management of irrigated land to ensure increased sustainability of soil and water resources, and (3) encourage policy that ensures more equitable access to irrigated land. During this research diverse university students will receive training in mixed methods research. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>	This dissertation investigates the interactions and feedbacks between irrigation megaprojects, soil management practices, and soil and water governance. Scholarship of environmental governance related to irrigation has focused on issues of water access and control. While important, more scholarly attention must examine the centrality of soils within irrigation megaprojects. The coupling of and tensions between water and soil use and governance require detailed empirical examination that leverages key literatures within geography and the spatial sciences, particularly environmental governance, coupled human-environment systems, and feminist political ecology. Three questions guide this research: (1) How does access to water from irrigation megaprojects shape soil management practices, specifically crop selection, crop rotations, and applications of agrochemicals? (2) How do social and environmental stressors inform soil management practices? (3) How do social and environmental stressors feedback into environmental governance? This research employs a mixed methods approach including change detection analysis, environmental archival research, participant observation, a survey, farm transect walks, and semi-structured interviews with farmers, irrigation managers, and government officials. This research project will provide new insights regarding sustainable and equitable approaches to irrigation development and governance in dryland areas in Colombia and elsewhere, including the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accommodate this growth, high speed networks with up to 400 Gbps capacities have been established. Despite the increasing availability of high-speed wide-area networks and the use of modern data transfer protocols designed for high performance, file transfers in practice attain only a fraction of theoretical maximum throughput, leaving networks underutilized and users unsatisfied. This project aims to develop a real-time transfer tuning algorithm to optimize file transfer throughput in high speed networks. Improved data transfer performance does not only enable efficient execution of distributed scientific applications but also fosters collaboration between scientists at geographically separated institutions by reducing time it takes to share data. This project complements the efforts to build next generation networking infrastructure by offering a novel solution to maximize utilization. The project also facilitates the development of a graduate level high-performance networking course at University of Nevada, Reno, and contribute to the education of undergraduate, female, and under-representative students. Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance national prosperity, and welfare. <br/><br/>It is critical to fully utilize available network bandwidth to meet stringent end-to-end performance requirements of distributed scientific workflows. Yet, existing data transfer applications (e.g., scp, bbcp, and ftp) fail to saturate the available network bandwidth due to several factors, such as end system limitations, ill-designed transfer protocols, and poor storage performances. Application-layer transfer tuning offers a comprehensive solution to enhance transfer throughput significantly and can be applied with only client-side modifications. However, finding optimal configuration for application-layer parameters is challenging due to large search space and complex dynamics of network and storage subsystems. This project applies state-of-the-art online convex optimization to application-layer parameter tuning problem as it offers performance and convergence guarantees even under complete uncertainty. In addition to being fast and optimal, online learning algorithms can guarantee the fair distribution of resources among users when combined with game-theory inspired utility functions. The project aims to improve the performance of large streaming applications under dynamic network conditions through anomaly detection and mitigation. It has three unique and innovative aspects: (i) It uses state-of-the art online learning algorithm to fine tune application-layer parameters in real-time. (ii) It improves accuracy and efficiency of sample transfers to minimize the overhead of real-time tuning. (iii) It offers quality of service for delay-sensitive transfers (e.g., high-speed streaming applications) through continuous performance monitoring and adaptive tuning.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many other industries use statistical sampling and sequential inspection methods for quality assurance. Yet, at present much of cyber security relies on attempted inspection of either 100% of items of a given type (such as top priority domain name server logs) or 0% (such as many types of possible hardware inspections). Working across two major universities, Ohio State University and the University of Wisconsin, the project develops new inspection methods, tailored to cyber security objectives. Specific objectives relate to hardware, cyber software vulnerabilities, log inspection, and emergency management and related scientific research. The project explores the usefulness of these new methods to senior quality professionals to support widespread adoption. By working smarter and not harder, scientists using this approach can feel more confident that their results are trustworthy, and, at the same time, the cost curve can be bent so that research can remain cost-competitive.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project models security metrics probabilistically and develops patterns of testing to estimate these metrics. The research addresses a variety of domains and cyber security challenges: (1) supercomputing log and hardware inspections, (2) ordinary department vulnerability sampling and estimation and improved logging and sampling (focusing on scientific infrastructure), (3) highly resourced department stratified sampling hardware, improved vulnerability decision-making, and strategic log generation and sampling, and (4) the UW Emergency Management system center. Metrics from attack-defend and standard quality assurance will be explored and serve as validation outputs for the techniques. This project seeks to meet the vital security needs by formulating an assurance framework that adapts and extends existing methods in quality control and assurance to the cyber domain. The assurance framework offers many advantages: it can address sequential decision-making, it can seek solutions that are robust to uncertain data, and it balances cost with threat reduction. The inspection methods to be studied include Multiple Complete Inspection & Inspector Inspection, Attempted 100% Inspection with Optimal Supplementation, Stratified Sampling, Sequential Sampling, and Optimal Multi-Fidelity Inspection. In each case, operating characteristic curves and other estimates of system integrity will be developed and applied. A key and unique element of the proposed approach is the combination of multiple inspection methods, including new methods, to provide a comprehensive framework for cost-effectively enhancing integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The India-Asia collision is the premier example of this happening today. The collision has produced the Tibetan Plateau, the region with the highest topography in the world, as well as deformation resulting in earthquakes and volcanic activity throughout eastern Asia affecting over a billion people. Despite more than 150 years of research on the topic, the evolution of the crust and mantle (lithosphere) beneath the Tibetan Plateau remains an enigma. There is surprisingly little agreement on the configuration of where Indian lithosphere is beneath Tibet and thus little agreement on the processes driving plateau uplift and growth as well as the evolution of the mantle beneath. This proposal is to develop a comprehensive high-resolution P and S wave seismic image of the crust and mantle beneath Tibet and surrounding regions. The goal is to better understand the dynamics of crust-mantle evolution during continental collision. This work will help in understanding past continental collisions and thus provide a better understanding of the geology of continents and the occurrence of natural resources. In the past 500 years more than one million people lost their lives in earthquakes within the study area of this project. The detailed lithospheric structures to be imaged in this work will improve our understanding of seismicity in this vast tectonically active zone of continental collision.  This work involves international collaborations with scientists in China and India, as well as training of graduate and undergraduate students at collaborating institutions in the US and internationally.<br/><br/>Seismic images will be developed through the application of full waveform inversion of three component regional broadband data that sample the crust and mantle beneath Tibet. The investigators will also incorporate teleseismic travel-time measurements and receiver functions in their model development. A large regional waveform database will be created using all available stations within and around the Tibetan plateau, taking full advantage of the enormous resources that have been dedicated to studies of Tibet in the past. Based on prior experience the team expects to be able to constrain structures with dimensions on the order of 50 km, both laterally as well as vertically. Their main goal is to map the Indian continental lithosphere (ICL) from northern India to regions below the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. The investigators expect to be able to make relatively precise estimates of the thickness of the mantle lithosphere beneath northern India and various parts of Tibet and the surrounding regions. This should put constraints on thickening of the Indian mantle lithosphere as well the location of a possible transition from very thick Indian cratonic lithosphere to thinner Indian continental marginal  lithosphere. Further goals will be to see if any instabilities can be imaged at the base of either the Indian or Tibetan lithosphere, and if and where Indian lithosphere is descending into the deeper mantle. Descent of cratonic lithosphere into the deeper mantle has implications for the permanence of cratonic mantle.

The project asks: how does economic change shape gendered institutions such as the household and related labor markets? A central problem is that a significant portion of agricultural work is not measured appropriately, and thus unrecorded in official statistics.  Four research questions guide this project: (a) how are official measures  of  women's  work constructed?  (b) what  is  the  impact  of economic  change in agriculture  at  the  local level  upon  one  measure  of women's  work?  (c) what  role  does  women's  unpaid  work play  in  the  explanation  of  the  links between economic  change in agriculture and paid  work? (d) how  does economic change  affect  intrahousehold power  relations  and gender norms?  This project examines the ways in which regulatory changes in agricultural policy affect women's work in agricultural production and marketing at interconnected levels of analysis: national, local, and household. At each level, the project seeks to show how women's paid and unpaid work is officially and unofficially defined in agricultural communities, and how this work is redefined under economic change. The findings from this project will contribute to a broader understanding of a) women's work--paid and unpaid activities undertaken within and beyond the household and b) how large-scale policy decisions translate into decisions made at the family and individual level. These findings will help generate recommendations on how households' and women's lives in agricultural areas may  be improved by change in formal policies including those focused on contract farming, deregulation of sales, and privatization of markets.<br/><br/>This  project will examine the  processes  by  which women's  work, particularly work in agricultural contexts, is  rendered visible  or invisible  in  the  market  economy.  The project will use a convergent mixed methods research framework to study the relationship between economic change and gendered institutions like the household and related labor markets. Within this framework, quantitative data from censuses and surveys and qualitative data from primary sources will be collected in the same phase of data production; both strands of data will then be analysed independently and merged at the stage of interpretation of results. To collect primary data, in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 60 women engaged in farm work and also associated with farmer producer companies, along with participant observation on farms and at agricultural markets around a larger urban area.

Yet, sociological research has overlooked examining the experiences of students within these institutions as such policies are implemented. This study asks how academic and social experiences of diverse students are shaped by more inclusive policies. Because college achievement, persistence, and student well-being in higher education remain unequal, this research will help policy makers within educational institutions as well as those with oversight responsibility to improve policies that contribute to positive educational outcomes. The findings will inform conversations regarding college admissions policies for students, with implications for studies of social opportunity and career prospects of students in the United States today. <br/><br/>This project employs a year-long comparative ethnography of admissions policies at two women's colleges. They are geographically proximate to one another, have similar levels of student enrollment and were both founded in the late 19th century. Yet one has a reputation for more inclusivity and one has a reputation for less inclusivity in terms of admissions policies. This project will use three types of ethnographic methods. It will analyze over 30 years of archival records relevant to admissions to set the context for contemporary observations. The project also includes 9 months of participant observation and interviews with 120 diverse students, alumni, and employees at the two colleges to examine day-to-day institutional practices and conversations relevant to admissions.

At the same time, flood, drought, and contamination mark several ways that water can also pose a threat to life. Human activity -- such as mismanagement, travel, pollution, conflict, and widening social disparities -- can also contribute to water's potential danger, including the spread of deadly waterborne diseases. Sudden or otherwise dramatic disruptions in drinking-water quality expose important ways that humans value such an invaluable resource. To develop programs, policies, and infrastructure that ensure all Americans access to safe water, it is critical to understand not only the interacting human and environmental factors that lead to drinking-water contamination, but also the ways that individuals and societies adjust to water crises.<br/><br/>The new presence of cholera in Haiti provides an exemplary case through which to study the dynamic relationship between humans and water. Cholera is a waterborne disease that causes profuse diarrhea and possible death from rapid fluid loss. The investigators, who started traveling to Haiti in 2008, have been researching the cholera epidemic there since it began in 2010, nine months after the earthquake. The investigators' extensive understanding of the local context, robust network of contacts, and previous data with which to make comparisons will foster the successful implementation and impact of forthcoming research. The research will be conducted in the coastal city and surrounding rural areas of Saint-Marc, Haiti, near the mouth of the Artibonite River, which was contaminated with cholera bacteria in October 2010, sparking one of the largest cholera epidemics in recent history. Though preventable by drinking clean water and treatable with timely rehydration, and despite significant national and international investment in relief efforts, many Haitians remain vulnerable to infection. With the disease now endemic, the presence of cholera has likely prompted substantial changes in the political economy, management, and consumption of water in Haiti. Investigators will assess the extent to which drinking-water for many Haitians has gone from a trusted common resource to a market commodity, industrialized product, or privately administered good. They will also evaluate whether these changes, driven by local and international actors, are resulting in improved access to safe water, particularly among the poor. Based in Saint-Marc, investigators will conduct interviews, archival, and participant-based research, observe and participate in everyday life, shadow clinicians, water engineers, and water entrepreneurs, and collect quantitative data about water quality and household water use. Research findings about the ways disease, the environment, and human society influence one another will illuminate factors that promote, perpetuate, or protect against water insecurity, poverty, and illness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These exhibited biological phenomena offer a scientifically-rich gold mine for problems. The astounding maneuvering performance exhibited by these flyers is a result of complex dynamic interaction that takes place between their flapping wings and the aerodynamics resulting from fluid flow over their bodies.  Some insects have been observed to perform turning maneuvers of greater than 3000 deg/s, with less than a 30 ms delay. In normal everyday flight, some birds may experience up to 14 g accelerations in super-maneuverable tasks, while the maneuverability of the most advanced fighter airplanes cannot exceed 8-9 g. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will focus on understanding the fundamental aspects and mechanisms of the dynamic interaction between the wing-body and fluid dynamics during flight. The results from the proposed research will enable engineers to design bio-inspired micro-air-vehicles without complicated sensory-control-actuator-processing systems by promoting self (natural) stabilization. The proposed research will boost the design capabilities of micro-air-vehicles and drones, which have great potential use in search and rescue missions, reconnaissance missions, filming, border monitoring, emergency response, etc. It is a multi-disciplinary work that bridges the gap between mathematics, physics, engineering, and biomechanics.

This will be achieved by a three-prong approach: (i) Theoretical: by developing a reduced-order flight dynamic model and analyzing the aerodynamics-body-wing-dynamics interactions using geometric control theory and higher-order averaging; (ii) Computational: by solving Navier-Stokes equations around the wings of a flapping insect, coupled with the mechanical equations governing the wing and body motion to study the role of leading and trailing edge vortices in the vibrational stabilization phenomenon; and (iii) Experimental: by building a multi degree-of-freedom test bed (with motion capture and flow visualization) to validate the theoretical and computational findings and experimentally assess the effectiveness of vibrational stabilization in flapping flight and scrutinize its physics. Finally, a new generation of flapping micro-air-vehicles will be developed with minimal actuation, relying on the discovered vibrational stabilization phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For more than 5000 years, indigenous groups created coastal landscapes dominated by such artificial hills built from many tons of shellfish  that left a legacy from which to study social and environmental change over millennia. Archaeology can provide new insights about how and why people built these mounded landscapes where shell was used to build architectural features (pyramids, ridges, walkways, plazas), to create mortuary mounds, and to construct elevated villages. A major challenge in the study of shell mounds is that many have been heavily damaged by the rapid development of coastal areas worldwide. This project will develop and implement new and innovative methods for working with ""legacy"" museum collections recovered from sites before they were destroyed. Researchers will generate new insights about the nature of shell mounds, provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in archaeological and museum methods, and contribute to a public outreach program highlighting the significant cultural heritage of these places. A centerpiece of this project will be the development of a public outreach program about shell mounds in collaboration with local tribes, community members, museums, and city governments.  <br/><br/>Members of the research team will engender a better understanding of the people who built mounded landscapes using new techniques to highlight their economies, social organizations,  and mortuary/ceremonial practices. The research will involve the fine-grained reanalysis of museum collections recovered from sites now destroyed employing new methods for recovering botanical remains and starch grains, identifying small animal bones using molecular fingerprinting, investigating ""micro"" artifacts, dating materials using state-of-the art techniques, and employing computer-generated mapping approaches.  Research will focus on the shell mounds in the greater San Francisco Bay Area (northern California) where hundreds of sites once dotted the shoreline before their destruction by urban development.  The West Berkeley shell mound, one of the largest and oldest of these mounds, will serve as a test case.  Archaeological materials from the 1950s excavation (before its destruction) now curated in the Phoebe A.

Physics is foundational to much of the fundamental research activity of US research and development efforts. The Vanderbilt University Summer REU program offers undergraduate physics and astronomy students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in a variety of subfields of physics. The areas include astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The research mentors are all well funded researchers and all have committed to personally directing the students. An extensive research infrastructure, including the facilities of several large interdisciplinary centers, will be available to the students. Physics students will also have the opportunity to visit major facilities at government laboratories, both domestic and international, including FermiLab, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, and CERN. <br/><br/>As part of the program's emphasis on leadership development, the program includes training in ethical conduct of research, and, as part of the program's emphasis on developing the future workforce, includes a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in physics. The REU program will achieve broad impact. In particular, the track record of the program over the past six years shows that a high percentage of the new participants will be underrepresented minority students, and the track record moreover shows that more than half of those participants will be from institutions with limited research opportunities. To achieve sustained impact, the program is designed to build ties between the Vanderbilt mentors, all of whom are supported with appropriate salary, and faculty at the student's home institution. This builds a larger community, provides for continued support for the student, and enhances the ability for continued mentoring and research participation of the student beyond the REU site experience.  Students also have the opportunity to participate in mini and short courses in entrepreneurship, computing, and data science while at Vanderbilt, as well as participating in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Physics and Astronomy Roadshow outreach program.

When refugees arrive, they initially receive refugee-specific services from their resettlement agency and then quickly transition to general welfare programs. Benefits such as food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) and Medicaid fill in the critical gaps not covered by resettlement assistance or eventual employment in entry-level jobs. Institutional factors matter in immigrant incorporation, yet we know little about how refugee-specific and general assistance programs differentiate the experience of arriving refugees. Refugee relationships to social services is further shaped by the city and state in which they are resettled. Decisions at the federal level disperse refugees to places that vary in their social policies and political climate. While the consequences of these decisions are felt at the local level by refugees, service providers, and communities, we know little about how refugee incorporation plays out in the approximately 350 destinations throughout the U.S. that receive refugees. This research examines resettlement in a diverse city with a history of immigration and a city that is not considered a traditional immigrant destination in order to understand the role of social services in refugee lives. Findings will contribute to discussion of how best to support refugees in localities across the U.S. and make the most efficient use of social services.<br/> <br/>This project uses participant observation and semi-structured interviews to examine the role of social service receipt in refugee lives as they incorporate into different resettlement contexts. Interviews in both cities focus on resettlement from the points of view of four key respondent subgroups. The project will conduct a total of 135 interviews to capture a multitude of perspectives on resettlement, including with: 1) 60 refugees from several countries of origin; 2) 40 representatives from local institutions (resettlement agencies, social service providers, local government, and schools); 3) 20 community members not formally employed to work with refugees; and 4) 15 interviews with national policymakers. Interviews will show how refugees interact with community institutions, how local communities respond to refugees, and how resettlement evolves beyond the walls of the resettlement agency. Observational and interview data will be analyzed and coded using Atlas.ti.

This research arena is an important theoretical and methodological marketplace where geneticists, biological anthropologists, paleoecologists, and archaeologists work to explain the process of global human dispersal. This is especially the case in the Americas, where genetic models predict that humans of the late Ice Age rapidly filled the Western Hemisphere, originating in greater Northeast Asia, spreading to Alaska, and reaching the Southern Cone of South America, between 24,000 and 12,000 calendar years ago. Archaeological evidence is required from these scattered regions to empirically test the genetic-based theory of how early hunter-gatherers dispersed. One of the most visible components of the archaeological record is the variable forms of weapons and projectile points that prehistoric hunters across northern Asia and America used, specifically stone lanceolate points versus bone/antler/ivory points, the latter sometimes inset with stone microblades. The functional, environmental, and social factors that influenced these weapon designs remain unknown. Why did ancient foragers of Siberia and Alaska employ different weapon systems as they entered the Americas? How did these variable weapons facilitate settlement of every ecological niche in the Western Hemisphere? The new research will offer insight into the use of major projectile-point technologies and human decision-making processes as early Americans dispersed through different environments, at the end of the Ice Age when dramatic climatic and ecological changes were taking place, broadening knowledge of human adaptability, especially in northern landscapes. The international context of the research will foster relationships between a new generation of American, Canadian, and Russian archaeologists investigating human behavioral change and adaptation in the circumpolar Arctic. The project will engage Alaskan Native communities through educational demonstrations of projectile systems traditionally used in subsistence activities, promoting positive relationships between archaeologists and the public. Understanding the functions of these important artifacts will help sustain traditional subsistence practices among Native Alaskans and will help reveal the reasons for ancient assemblage differences and ultimately how these differences relate to the colonization of Beringia and the Americas.<br/><br/>Joshua Lynch, PhD candidate at Texas A&M University, will examine variability in projectile technologies Ice Age Siberia and Beringia by examining the range of morphological and functional variation in lithic, osseous, and composite points to test hypotheses explaining why different projectile technologies co-occur in the early archaeological record of the far north. This will be achieved through a series of experiments employing projectiles reflective of archaeological examples used in three different weapon systems (hand-thrust spear, bow and arrow, and spear thrower) to generate a new standard of breakage and use-wear patterns for ancient weapon technologies. By establishing the functions of specific point forms, project results will improve interpretations of Ice Age archaeological assemblage variability as it relates to foraging behavior, landscape use, site function, and cultural variability. Further, macro- and microscopic analyses of projectile points from more than 40 pivotal Siberian and Alaskan archaeological sites will be conducted and compared to the results of the experimental testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Copolymers are a special class of polymers. They are made by using two (or more) different monomers and, depending on how the monomers are combined, the copolymers can exhibit unique properties. In biological copolymers, such as DNA and proteins, the sequence of monomers is precisely controlled by the cell. In contrast, controlling the sequence of monomers in the laboratory remains a significant challenge, and this limits the usefulness of synthetic copolymers.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry and the Chemical, Structure Dynamics, and Mechanisms A Programs in Division of Chemistry, Professor DuBay at the University of Virginia is using computer simulations to study copolymers that are grown step-by-step. Professor DuBay and her students have developed a computer model to simulate copolymer growth.  They are using the model to better understand the factors that determine the monomer sequence. Insights gained from their studies could enable better sequence control, which could impact technologies ranging from energy conversion, to water purification and drug delivery. This research project is conducted by a diverse team of undergraduate and graduate researchers, training them for productive careers in the chemical industry. In addition, the next generation of professional communicators are embedded into  the lab, enabling them to better understand the scientific process and recognize and report on breakthrough achievements. Finally, this project focuses on improving the scientific information literacy of current college students to better equip them to carefully assess information from a variety of public sources. <br/><br/>Emergent collective behaviors among the polymerizing chains, such chain alignment, self-templating, or phase separations, can significantly influence how often different reactive species encounter one another during a copolymerization and the probability of a reaction when they do. As a result, such behaviors are expected to affect the incorporation frequency and placement of different monomers in the chain. However, the current theoretical framework for understanding what governs copolymer sequences does not account for such complexities. Professor DuBay is utilizing coarse-grained simulations of step-growth copolymerizations to study the influence of such behaviors on copolymer sequence. By combining Langevin dynamics with a reactive cutoff distance approach that allows for the formation of polymer bonds, these simulations enable a comprehensive investigation of the influence of various monomer characteristics and reaction conditions on the resulting copolymer sequences. Copolymers and reaction regimes that are shown to be sensitive to this unconventional mechanism of sequence biasing are being studied through a collaboration with synthetic polymer chemists. In addition, Professor DuBay is developing a program to embed future writers and communicators in polymer-focused research labs as well as a novel polymer case-study based curriculum for introductory chemistry courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project involves analysis of samples from the GISP2D ice core drilled at Summit, Greenland, and will develop an atmospheric history of carbonyl sulfide (COS). Variations in atmospheric COS can be linked to growth of plants on land because they take up COS from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. The Greenland ice core record of COS from this project will be used to document possible changes in terrestrial plant growth over the last 1000 years and to constrain the natural controls on stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer. This project will support training of a doctoral student at UC Irvine and provide hands-on research experience for several undergraduate students in a state-of-the-art analytical chemistry laboratory. It will also support K-12 outreach activities by the UC Irvine ice core laboratory in local middle and high schools through the CLEAN Education initiative, a non-profit founded and operated by graduate students at UC Irvine.<br/><br/>The investigators previously measured COS in ice cores from several different Antarctic sites, recovering COS records of the southern hemisphere atmosphere over periods that range from centuries to multi-millennia.

Ice core air will be dry-extracted and analyzed with an existing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system. COS lifetime in the atmosphere is only 2 years and its atmospheric budget is poorly understood. Estimates of COS removal from the atmosphere via photosynthesis by land plants far exceed the known emissions, possibly pointing to an unidentified natural source. Modeling work suggests knowing the pole-to-pole COS difference in the preindustrial atmosphere would provide a robust constraint on the nature and magnitude of the unidentified source(s). The GISP2D measurements for the last 1000 years before present will be conducted at high-resolution. This includes the Little Ice Age period, during which Antarctic ice core records display a decline in atmospheric COS. The new Greenland measurements will constitute a northern hemisphere analogue to existing Antarctic records. Results will be used to study climate driven variability in atmospheric COS and implications for changes in plant growth and variability in background stratospheric sulfate in the preindustrial atmosphere. The project includes plans for a comprehensive modelling effort with a 6-box model of the atmosphere, which will be coupled to ocean and terrestrial vegetation models. Measurements from 3000 to 1000 years before present will be conducted at lower resolution and the primary goal will be to gain further insight into the slow in-situ hydrolysis loss of COS in ice cores that has been previously observed in Antarctic ice cores over multi-millennial time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In surface waters where phytoplankton grow and support the base of the marine food web, trace elements are often present at vanishingly small concentrations. This presents great challenges to marine life, and trace elements can be limiting factors for phytoplankton productivity.  Biological processes in marine systems like phytoplankton growth, grazing, dissolved organic matter production, and sedimentation can in turn have important impacts on how trace elements cycle through the ocean. These inter-relationships are complex and not very well understood, but they have important ramifications for ecosystem productivity and global nutrient cycling. The research proposed here seeks to study the relationships between trace element distributions and chemistry and biological processes in a dynamic and ecologically significant environment - upwelling filaments in the coastal California Current System.  Field studies will take advantage of the ongoing California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) site, which already has funded cruises planned for 2019 and 2021. This project will support the education and training of graduate students, and the participation of both the PI and graduate students in education and outreach activities carried out through the CCE-LTER project, including mentoring undergraduates in research projects and contributing to public education and outreach through the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.<br/><br/><br/>The availability of trace element micronutrients is increasingly recognized as an important influence on the productivity and structure of marine phytoplankton communities. Trace elements themselves are strongly influenced by biological processes in terms of their residence time, chemical speciation, and cycling in marine systems.  Field process studies which fully characterize the biological and physical dynamics of upper ocean systems with simultaneous determination of multiple trace elements in situ have the potential to greatly inform our understanding of the coupled interactions between trace elements and biota, but such studies are comparatively rare due to their interdisciplinary complexity and expense. This proposal seeks support to perform such a study by leveraging the ongoing California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research program (CCE-LTER). Two upcoming funded LTER process cruises in 2019 and 2021 will characterize the biogeochemical and ecological evolution of upwelling filaments as they move offshore via a combination of survey mapping, detailed sampling and Lagrangian process measurements. This project funds the acquisition and setup of a seaFAST pico preconcentration system and ICP-MS analytical time which will enable the study of multiple trace elements in the context of these cruises. This type of mesoscale feature has rarely been characterized from the standpoint of trace element biogeochemistry, and we anticipate that our findings will be of broad interest to the oceanographic community. A number of hypotheses regarding the sources, sinks and cycling of trace elements in an upwelling filament will be examined in the proposed work. This project will also take advantage of ongoing research collaborations within CCE-LTER to couple multi-elemental trace element data sets with molecular-level information on community structure and function and dissolved organic matter composition. This will facilitate exploration of the response of biological communities to multi-factorial co-limitation, the role of organic molecules in mediating trace metal cycles, and the coupling of trace metal cycles with the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and silica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a lack of natural materials that only absorb invisible infrared light. This problem limits the efficiency of next-generation solar cells and infrared light sensors. This project addresses this problem by artificially structuring light-absorbing materials on the nanometer scale to control their color. These new materials will be used to make high-efficiency solar cells and color-selective light sensors. The insights and new technologies developed through this project could have wide-ranging applications. Areas that could be impacted include sustainable energy harvesting, hazardous gas sensing, night vision systems, and biomedical imaging. The research activities will be integrated with interdisciplinary educational and outreach activities. These include curriculum development for undergraduate and graduate level classes on nanotechnology and renewable energy. Research team members will also serve as STEM mentors for elementary school students in Baltimore City public schools.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objectives of the proposed research are to design and build new color-tuned nanomaterials with finite-absorption-bandwidths (FABs) based on photonic band engineering in strongly absorbing materials and use them to make cost-effective multijunction solar cells and narrow-band photodetectors. The proposed research aims to solve the problem of a lack of infrared (IR) optical materials with spectral absorption and transmission profiles that can be independently controlled through the development of new FAB materials composed of colloidal quantum dot thin films for IR responsivity and photonic structuring for visible transparency via control of the in-plane photonic band structure.  Methods to be employed include electromagnetic simulations, chemical synthesis, solution-processed device fabrication, and optoelectronic device characterization. The main goals of the project are to (1) establish a quantitative theory for how photonic band structure depends on material absorption using electromagnetic simulations and coupled oscillator theory, (2) build FAB materials using photonic band engineering and self-assembled fabrication techniques, and (3) use the FAB materials to build multijunction solar cells and narrow-band IR photodetectors. If successful, the proposed work will result in a new method for improving the efficiency of current solar cell and photodetector technology by introducing a new class of optoelectronically-active materials that absorb only in the infrared. The project seeks to advance the understanding of fundamental energy transfer processes in nanostructured materials on multiple length scales and use emergent bulk effects to build new optoelectronic devices. These new insights and devices have the potential to enable research in other fields where photoactive materials with controllable spectral profiles could be used for lighting, sensing, and imaging applications, e.g. In addition to the experimental work, the goal of providing a theoretical and computational underpinning for understanding materials behavior on multiple length scales should broaden materials and device research in general by adding to the toolbox of materials and effects that can be exploited for novel applications. The integrated educational and outreach components of the project are designed to engage elementary, undergraduate, and graduate students in the fields of nanotechnology and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although new sources of fossil fuels are being found and cleaner extraction techniques are being developed, alternatives to fossil fuels are needed that produce fewer greenhouse gases. The overarching goal of the REU's research projects is to advance knowledge and understanding of alternative technologies while reducing dependence on fossil fuels for the production of energy, fuel, clean water, and/or materials. This REU supports the education of students from institutions with few research opportunities, particularly for under-represented groups and first-generation college students. Students will be actively recruited from 2- and 4-year regional institutions in the EPSCOR states Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, as well as through the national networks of the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and American Indian Science and Engineering Society chapters. The students will be mentored throughout their summer research to encourage them to continue their studies in graduate work, with a goal of broadening their representation in academic research.<br/><br/>The Solar and Alternative Technologies Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site will involve undergraduate students in summer research projects for 10 weeks developing fuel, catalysts, power, clean water, and plastics from renewable sources or using renewable energy. The projects include water desalination and the production of microalgal biofuel, biocatalysts, and nanoellipsoids. More than half of the projects focus on solar energy, ranging from a new way to produce silicon, to the effects of fluid flow patterns on energy production, to the matching of energy resources and needs to create a micro-grid for local energy needs. The undergraduate students will learn about responsible conduct of research, environmental ethics, technical communication through journal articles and oral presentations, and posting about research on social media. Students will give two progress presentations and a final oral report and prepare a final written formal report, similar to a journal article. Tours will include local hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, and waste-to-energy facilities. The goal of the REU is to encourage under-represented groups in the pursuit of graduate studies by mentoring them in undergraduate research.

Up to the present time, conventional static state estimators have been widely deployed in utility control centers to improve the estimation accuracy and expand the monitoring areas. However, these estimators are no longer sufficient for monitoring the modern power grid, which is experiencing increasing uncertainty and variation driven by the high penetration of intermittent renewable (especially solar and wind) generation. In fact, conventional static state estimation methods for power grids often fail in providing any useful information during transmission-line tripping and cascading grid failures when the power system rapidly changes, and state estimation results are crucially needed. There is a technical gap in modeling a complex system, which is not fully understood, and whose behaviors can change rapidly. To bridge the gap, the project team will develop a data-fusion framework for an integrated dynamic state estimator (iDSE) that can not only estimate current operational conditions but also predict their future trends, and quantify their uncertainty. Because the framework addresses the fundamental issue in the situational awareness of a complex system, the research results will shed light on that research challenge in other complex infrastructures, which are time-varying, and with high uncertainty. The project team will disseminate the new theory and methods to industry and academia, train college students, and historically underrepresented middle/high-school students. Thus the project will increase diversity and improve the preparation of future power system engineers so that the power grid can be modernized to host more renewable generation.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop a data-fusion framework for an integrated dynamic state estimator (iDSE) to estimate and predict power system states by integrating signal processing theory and statistical inference theory. Encouraged by preliminary results that multiple-hypothesis filtering algorithms can track rapid variation in states, and the observation that belief function theory can more efficiently handle the uncertainty from incomplete and conflicting information than Bayesian probability theory, the new iDSEs will be created by integrating belief function theory and multiple-hypothesis testing with multiple models to assimilate heterogeneous data and gain the following three capabilities: (1) Leveraging dynamical models together with static power flow models, the new iDSEs will achieve additional robustness through increased spatial and temporal redundancy; (2) Leveraging the capability of belief function theory to explicitly model incomplete and conflicting information, the new iDSEs will efficiently quantify and mitigate the negative impacts of both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty inherent in the power system; (3) Leveraging multiple dissimilar estimation criteria and models, the new iDSEs will effectively deal with quick dynamical changes in the power system and predict future states using multiple-hypothesis testing. It is expected that the new iDSE will significantly increase the situational awareness of an operator and lay the groundwork for transforming state estimation and power system operations from the current static paradigm into a future dynamic paradigm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The STAGE lab creates and develops emotionally engaging, entertaining theatre and film work inspired by science and technology, and explores the use of new technologies in the staging of its productions, to inform the public about science and technology. Utilizing a creative methodology modeled on the exploratory process of experimental science, a postdoctoral scholar is driving a collaborative project to create an original theatrical script that bridges the gap between public perception and scientific reality in complex research areas, focusing on the field of quantum mechanics. The culminating production fosters understanding of the key scientific theme, and more broadly, the scientific process and the importance of discovery, while also addressing the need to promote the understanding of the sciences in the public arena. In addition to the quantum physics play Entanglement, the postdoctoral scholar is collaborating on parallel projects about the science of food, symmetry in nature, and artificial intelligence. Under the mentorship of the PI, the postdoctoral scholar is leading all aspects of developing Entanglement and is driving the play to public performances using the resources available to them through the University of Chicago. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The theatre project Entanglement, led by the postdoctoral scholar, is promoting the understanding and appreciation of the complex scientific topic of quantum information in the public arena. STAGE, with its method of finding subtle parallels and metaphors between scientific themes and human experience, is translating the richness and nuances of this topic into a relatable form of expression. Participants include scientists, engineers, technology/media experts, professional artists (e.g., actors, directors, writers, dramaturgs, cinematographers, editors, as well as set, lighting, sound, projection, and costume designers), and undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars from all disciplines, all working simultaneously whenever possible. Much of the script is created through improvisation, and each improvisation is akin to running an experiment, i.e., the improvisation is used to generate and investigate new ideas, with continuous analysis and feedback. The project participants weigh and examine what each improvisation reveals, and, just as scientists analyze their results and use that information to revise an experiment, the project team adjust the circumstances of a scenario and improvise again to guide the creation of the script, as well as what will eventually be performed publicly. Moreover, the STAGE lab has a team of quantum physicists and nanotechnology experts actively collaborating on the theatre piece. Through this project, students, scientists, and the public engage with the University of Chicago students and faculty, the surrounding neighborhoods of Hyde Park, Chicago's South Side, and the greater Chicago area, all of which provide a diverse, multicultural audience, including underrepresented minority and at-risk students.

THz waves are extremely high frequency signals (100 GHz 10 THz) that enable unique imaging capabilities. Unless looking into a well-polished surface, human eyes and regular cameras can only discern objects that are in the line of sight, therefore an object located around a corner is not visible. On the other hand, terahertz (THz) waves exhibit strong reflections from common building surfaces. Using THz cameras walls or doors can appear as mirrors, thus allowing to peek inside rooms and cavities otherwise hidden from direct sight. Such capability will augment vision and situational awareness of first responders and rescuers in unreachable and uncharted environments. Interestingly, non-line-sight imaging capabilities could be leveraged from the next generation of ultra-fast wireless communication systems. Future communication systems will be equipped with antennas that can operate as cameras and transfer data. The synergy of THz communications and imaging will enable uninterrupted links and user mobility. Additionally, non-line-of-sight imaging will enable localization of users with centimeter-level accuracy for applications in virtual/augmented reality or assisted healthcare. The proposed project will also emphasize on educating a broader audience of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. With the use of augmented reality headsets, the students will implement software that allows the visualization of THz imaging capabilities in the real-world. Additionally, the PI will collaborate with local first responders and military veterans to educate them through workshops on the capabilities and opportunities of the new imaging technology.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to design image reconstruction algorithms and hardware topologies that will enable real-time, 3D THz imaging of both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) objects from a single observation point. The five-year career-development plan has the following objectives: 1) Analyze the mechanisms that distort images in multipath imaging and implement algorithms to invert the process for accurate image reconstruction. 2) Design topologies for NLoS THz imaging and understand the requirements for communication and imaging coexistence. 3) Implement methods for simultaneous localization and mapping and synergy between imaging and communication protocols for efficient channel estimation. The intellectual merit of this work is to understand wavefront distortions of THz waves in multipath and multi-reflection scenarios and use this knowledge to implement inverse scattering methods to reconstruct images from backscattered signals. This knowledge will also help us understand the hardware imaging requirements and how NLoS imaging can collaborate with communication hardware for novel applications. Using the 3D images of the surrounding, the proposed research will provide a new approach for channel estimation for the next generation of ultrafast wireless communications. In the long term, this research will contribute to the national security by enabling first response, surveillance and reconnaissance in hostile and uncharted environment, allow autonomous navigation in crowed spaces, and provide a path for the integration of imaging and communications for faster wireless data transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the use of solar, wind, and biomass technologies to provide electricity both on and off national grids is escalating worldwide. Energy access and use is not just a technological issue but also a social one, creating opportunities and risks related to connection and production. While there has been significant research on the social effects of carbon-based energy production and use, we know less about the specific ways alternative forms of energy transform peoples' lives, create new opportunities or risk, and affect relationships between individuals and communities. Understanding how alternative forms of energy are perceived and used at the household level, especially by those who may not have access to traditional forms of electrification, is a crucial part of assessing whether and how alternative energy sources can contribute to a more comprehensive and secure portfolio of energy options. Findings from this research will illuminate the ways alternative energy technologies are incorporated into daily life and to what effect, and will inform national and international energy policies that can be targeted toward meeting the needs of the most marginalized members of society. The project also provides training for students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis; broadens participation in the sciences through the training of students and researchers from underrepresented groups; and it improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration.<br/><br/>Dr. Kristin Phillips of Emory University and Dr. Erin Dean of the New College of Florida will explore the question of whether the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of new energy technologies are socioeconomically differentiated. This research will examine the impact of solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies on the everyday lives of people in the East African nation of Tanzania. Tanzania is a particularly appropriate place for such a study because the state's pursuit of traditional carbon energy development has been coupled with a notable rise in alternative, renewable energy investment by public and private sources. It provides an appropriate laboratory for investigating energy consumption at the household level, where 90% of energy consumption takes place). The researchers have each worked for over a decade in Tanzania, and their in-country research background is geographically diverse, providing the opportunity to consider different approaches to energy use in rural, urban, peri-urban, and island contexts. Because the existing literature tends to overlook the role of women in energy production and consumption, gendered energy labor and use is an important focus of this research. With gender and geographic range in mind, the core of the research for this project will be conducted through critical case studies in domestic settings in three diverse sites. The researchers will use purposive sampling to identify socioeconomically diverse households who are using a range of energy technologies. Using the methods of observation, interviews, and focus groups, they will investigate the socioeconomic dimensions of renewable energy development. The researchers will also conduct interviews with energy experts, advocates, suppliers, policymakers, investors, and technicians in the public and private sector. Findings from the project will make important contributions to scientific discussions about the optimization of energy extraction, theories of inequality, and debates about infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The motivating applications of the project include crowd labeling tasks (which is a powerful paradigm for utilizing human wisdom to collect data labels), sequential product recommendation, and online multi-product pricing. For all these applications, online learning and sequential decision-making are indispensable to each other. The objective of this project is to develop new sequential learning algorithms with rigorous theoretical guarantees. The developed framework will not only make fundamental technical contributions but also facilitate many important applications. For example, it will greatly improve the aggregated answers from crowd labelers with a significantly reduced cost. It can enhance the revenue of business while improving the customers' satisfaction by providing accurate recommendations. In addition, this project also facilitates the development of new courses on machine learning for business school students, which helps bring the knowledge from data science to future business leaders, and provides training to K-12 students, with an emphasis on those from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project strives to develop a unified learning and decision-making framework, which serves as an intellectual bridge connecting machine learning, stochastic optimization, and decision theory. In particular, there are three complementary research thrusts. The first thrust creates a suite of efficient algorithms that deal with complex task structures, such as ranking with transitivity structures or product recommendation with combinatorial structures, in a non-stationary environment. The algorithms will extend the bandit learning with finite independent arms into the setting with a complex correlation structure among potentially infinite number of arms. The second thrust seeks a cost-effective paradigm that either incorporates ""optimal stopping"" rule under a certain budget constraint or minimizes the sample complexity. The third thrust systematically evaluates the algorithms and theories on real problems coming from both crowdsourcing and other business-related applications.

This loss of biodiversity is likely reducing the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. Some of these benefits are directly related to plants, including the production of livestock forage in grasslands and wood in forests. There has been some progress in understanding the consequences of biodiversity loss. But it remains challenging to quantify how species loss affects ecosystems over large areas. This study establishes new experiments to expand knowledge of plant productivity and biodiversity. The key advance of this project is to study the mechanisms linking productivity and biodiversity at different spatial scales. Data will be made publicly available through the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research website. Results will be incorporated into Cedar Creek's K-12 education and community engagement programs. These programs serve more than 10,500 K-12 students and visitors each year. The study will also help understand how the diversity of teams can enhance learning and productivity.<br/><br/>This study will test predictions about ecosystem productivity. Productivity depends on local plant diversity and species interactions at small spatial scales. However, at larger scales, additional factors such as dispersal and species sorting are likely more important. At these larger scales, it is important to develop new techniques to measure biodiversity such as remote sensing using hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR. This study will investigate the landscape-scale dependence of productivity on biodiversity using three approaches. First, the impact of dispersal on biodiversity and productivity in grassland plant communities will be experimentally tested. Second, remote sensing techniques will be used to quantify how biodiversity effects on productivity change from local to landscape scales. Third, the role of dominant species will be experimentally tested across several habitat types, including grassland, savanna, deciduous forest, coniferous forest. The hypothesis will be tested that dominant plant species are optimally sorted across heterogeneous landscapes. This would create positive effects of landscape diversity on productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this lack of oxygen, microbes living in these regions live in ways that differ from those in oxygenated waters consuming nitrate ions instead of oxygen for respiration.  Use of nitrate for microbial respiration results in the production of nitrogen gas which is called denitrification.  The resulting removal of nitrate has consequences for the whole ocean as nitrogen is an important nutrient controlling plant growth; however, whereas plants can use nitrogen in the form of nitrate, they cannot, with a few exceptions, use nitrogen gas. There remains a number of uncertainties regarding how much denitrification occurs in the ocean, what controls it, and how it varies in time and space.  Traditional studies of ocean denitrification have been limited by the time ships can be at sea and the relatively small proportion of the ocean they can observe.  Our project plans to remedy this problem by using vehicles called floats that can operate autonomously in the ocean for three years or more as they drift with currents over hundreds of kilometers.  We will outfit ten floats with sensors to measure oxygen and nitrogen gas which will be placed throughout the oxygen depleted region of the Pacific Ocean to the west of Mexico.  This is the largest such region in the ocean from which we have two years of results from a prototype float which validated our approach.  This study may well transform our understanding of ocean denitrification and ultimately benefit society as a whole through greater confidence in predictions of the ocean's nitrogen cycle and capacity to fix carbon dioxide under current and future conditions.  Application and further development of float systems using commercially available technology will directly benefit successor studies, and more broadly showcase the use of water-following platforms to tackle difficult oceanographic problems. Advances from this study are expected to carry over to other disciplines including ocean biogeochemical modeling.  Outreach activities, support for an early career scientist, and student training are included in the project.  For the outreach activities, the investigators plan to tie into well-established after-school programs serving underrepresented populations in Massachusetts and established opportunities for public presentations using float related display materials at the University of Washington.  <br/><br/>Oxygen deficient zones (ODZs), despite constituting a small fraction of total oceanic volume, play important roles in regulating global ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles including hosting 30 to 50% of the global loss of fixed nitrogen. Unfortunately, current uncertainty in ODZ nitrogen loss derives from substantial temporal and spatial variability in rates that remain under-sampled by ship-based measurements. While local regulation of nitrogen loss by oxygen and organic matter availability are well accepted, temporal/spatial variability in the nitrogen flux is likely a result of the influence of physical forcings such as remote ventilation, seasonal variability, and mesoscale eddies. Understanding how the impact of physical forcings on nitrogen loss as mediated through oxygen and organic flux will be required to fully understand the causes and consequences of any future ODZ expansion. To improve our understanding of ODZ nitrogen loss, we will carry out a multiyear, autonomous float-based observational program to address outstanding questions regarding bioavailable nitrogen loss in ODZs.  As the largest ODZ and region of our pilot deployments, our operation area will be the Eastern Tropical N. Pacific (ETNP) where our study will determine over a multi-year period, in-situ nM-level oxygen and biogenic nitrogen on float profiles spanning geographic gradients in oxygen and surface productivity. For the first time, our study will also determine in situ nitrogen loss rates from changes in nitrogen  concentration during 1 to 2 week Lagrangian float drifts along a constant density surface. A pilot 2 yr float deployment in the ETNP documents our ability to do so. Critically, our float-based approach more closely matches the frequency and distribution of observations to the expected variability in biogenic nitrogen production as compared to prior work and will dramatically increase the data density for this region by acquiring >500 profiles/drifts for nitrogen and >1000 profiles for nM oxygen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many studies have shown that the ability to attend to items is highly limited; yet, it is unclear where these limits stem from and what the underlying neural mechanisms are that determine these limits. In this proposal we aim to test what constrains our ability to select information and to examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different selection demands and sensory environments. We use the human visual system as a model system to test how attention interacts with perceptual representations to guide behavior, and to examine how attention modulates neural activity to enhance perception and memory. Understanding how attention modulates these neural representations in visual cortex will help to uncover how variations in these neural patterns give rise to common perceptual and cognitive disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia.   <br/><br/>The current research project aims to broadly understand how attention operates in different sensory environments and task contexts. We hypothesize that the capacity limits of feature-based attention are constrained by a combination of the organization of feature representations in the visual system (i.e., perceptual confusability) and by center-surround selection mechanisms. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the selection mechanisms are flexible and adjust to current task demands in terms of magnitude (enhancement and suppression) and shape (e.g., shifts in tuning curves; size of the inhibitory surround). Our approach includes psychophysics, computational modeling, and electrophysiological recordings (frequency-tagged potentials in EEG) that can tease apart perceptual factors from attentional effects, and allow to directly measure feature representations in visual cortex. Together, the proposed experiments will provide important insights into how perceptual organization and attention mechanisms interact to influence limits of attention, and will examine the flexibility of the human attention system across different task contexts. The development of novel experimental designs and neural measures to track perceptual representations in visual cortex and how they are modulated by attention will be important to test perceptual and cognitive models and how they influence visual processing more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mechanical and electrical behaviors of a cell are two basic properties that indicate cell state, and consequently are important for health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and tissue repair. A comprehensive assessment of cellular status requires the knowledge of both mechanical and electrical properties at the same time, which remains challenging because the two properties are usually measured by different sensors, while the degree of cell perturbation increases with the number of sensors used. This project aims to develop a type of nanoscale (i.e., very small) sensor which can simultaneously measure both the mechanical and electrical properties in a cell. The convergence of both measurements in one sensor will provide (1) an automatic solution to the simultaneous measurement of both properties, and (2) a means of acquiring information without introducing additional cell perturbation. This sensor technology can lead to more precise biomedical devices for disease modeling, drug screening, and health diagnostics. The interdisciplinary research will also serve as a platform for outreach and broadening participation in STEM education.<br/><br/>This project will investigate multiple sensing mechanisms in a nanostructured sensor to enable simultaneous mechanical- and electrical-signal couplings and transductions at the cell-sensor interface. The central approach is to borrow from structures in multifunctional biological sensory organelles to engineer a nanoscale sensor, which is expected to yield functional emulation for multi-parameter sensing. The concept of merging multiple sensing functions in one device will broaden the capabilities of general bio-interface engineering, yielding (1) a solution in synchronization and scalability for multiparameter measurements and (2) a ?2-in-1? economical integration approach important for minimizing invasiveness to biosystems.

This has led the scientific community to adopt approximate statistical procedures that achieve the optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical efficiency.  On the one hand, the approximation should be tractable to gain computational benefits. On the other hand, the approximation needs to be tight, so as to not compromise much in terms of the statistical optimality of the original problem. This project aims to bridge the computational and theoretical gaps in various statistical problems under complex and nonstandard settings.

Water has low toxicity, low vapor pressure, and high solubility for many compounds.  However, water is becoming increasingly limited and expensive as a resource. For example, we currently use more than 2 million gallons of water for each hydraulically fracked well, which requires costly water treatment to remove contaminants.  This is equivalent to 40,000 baths, an amount of water that is raising serious concern in arid American states. Due to these environmental concerns, the use of supercritical CO2 fracking fluids is an important research area. Supercritical CO2 systems have extraordinary potential to reduce water use and greatly reduce the environmental impact of current and next-generation industrial processes.  In many of these processes, molecules called surfactants are also vital to their use.  Surfactants lower the surface tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid.  Surfactants affect the transport of fluids in these complex environments involving oil, water, gases, and solids. However, very little is known regarding their effect at high pressure.  This lack of understanding is slowing major strides in the use of CO2 as a ""green"" alternative solvent in separations, in chemical reactions, medical device fabrication, and hydrocarbon fracking fluids. The principal investigator has recently developed and demonstrated an instrument to accurately measure properties of surfactants at high pressure interfaces and surfaces and understand how chemical structure influences performance. <br/><br/>This award will focus on developing thermodynamic and transport models describing surfactant interfacial activity at high pressure interfaces via a newly developed high pressure microtensiometer and analysis technique. Model parameterization will result from analyzing static and dynamic interfacial tension data of various surfactants at various interfaces as a function of pressure and temperature. This work will be highly facilitated by a time scale analysis taking into account the effect of interfacial curvature, surfactant concentration, and bulk fluid flow, which allows for the distinction between kinetic and diffusion transport mechanisms. Several chemistry/performance correlations are expected. For example, quantification of partition coefficients in various phases will determine the preferential solubility of different chemical structures and their applicability in high pressure processes. Interfacial rheology studies will allow for better understanding of foam and emulsion stability as a function of chemical structure and interfacial activity. A theoretical framework that combines kinetic theories and thermodynamic equations of state models will guide design of improved molecular architectures. The model parameters generated by this work will allow for (1) a deeper understanding of surfactant thermodynamics at elevated pressures (2) a direct correlation between transport parameters and surfactant structure and ultimately (3) correlation between molecular structure and performance in industrial applications. Educationally, this funded work in partnership with the Lindy Scholars Program and the Upper Darby School District, will develop a STEM CAREER path building program involving five diverse elementary/middle schools. In collaboration with the Louis Stokes-Alliance for Minority Participation, we will introduce and prepare under-represented minorities for research training during their Drexel tenure.

Because UHMC has a high population of Native Hawaiian students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The goals of the project are to build institutional capacity to better serve low-income (including Native Hawaiian) students by increasing 1) STEM faculty capacity to serve low-income students, and 2) academic success, retention, graduation and transfer rates of low-income scholars. The project seeks to design and implement an innovative, culturally-appropriate academic program for UHMC low-income students to improve overall graduation and transfer rates to four-year institutions.  In addition, the project seeks to understand how the integration of the indigenous Ka'ao Framework, based on Tinto's model of institutional departure, impacts scholar success indicators, especially for low-income and Native Hawaiian STEM students. Results will be used to advance knowledge of the impact of integrating culturally-appropriate models on the success of STEM students in places with distinctive cultural traits, such as Hawaii. The knowledge generation component will test the hypothesis that the Ka'ao Framework's preventative classroom intervention will be a protective factor for fall-to-fall retention for low-income UHMC students. Comparisons will be made to evaluate the effect the Ka'ao Framework has on student outcomes. This will include a comparison of participating students to like-students that do not receive the intervention. Using data analytics to build a predictive statistical model of significant factors in retention, graduation, and transfer, the project will explore what works for whom among STEM majors, low-income STEM majors, and Native Hawaiian STEM majors at a two-year institution. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. This timely research extends emerging evidence-based practices when the nation is critically examining ways to improve low national graduation and retention rates to meet future STEM workforce demands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These services rely on correct and efficient functioning of complex networked systems, which are prone to failures that are often caused by human error. Existing technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN) seek to reduce human error by providing centralized network management and programmability via a standard API, and by separating network management (the SDN ""control-plane"") from packet forwarding (the SDN ""data-plane""). While centralization permits a single network controller to have a global view of the network--which simplifies the control logic--it suffers from severe scalability limitations when the size of a network increases. Moreover, modern SDN data-planes feature powerful, decentralized devices that are able to perform computations and update their local state based on packet contents, thereby allowing them to implement functionality traditionally restricted to the SDN control-plane. Such decentralization requires viewing a network program as a distributed system running on network hardware, rather than as a process running on a controller and interacting with switches. This project establishes a new approach for constructing modern network programs, viewed as distributed systems. The project's novelties are (i) a new abstraction for writing network programs that takes distribution into account and ensures that a network program correctly maintains distributed views of global state; and (ii) techniques for ensuring efficiency of network programs: the techniques ensure that network performance is not penalized by maintenance of global state. The project's impacts are (i) contributions to the general understanding of how to properly build distributed systems, and (ii) development of a language and associated tools which eliminate some of the difficulties domain experts face in building these systems.<br/><br/>The key contribution is a thorough investigation of the network data-plane as a platform for executing dynamic, stateful code, resulting in a programming system which allows network functions to be realized in the data-plane, and ensures that network programs are verifiably correct and efficiently implementable. The project has two research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on generalizing and implementing event nets. While previous work introduced the concept of event nets (a Petri-nets-based abstraction) for event-driven programming in the context of SDN, this project enriches the event nets language with functionality needed to make it easily usable in other domains such as wireless sensor networking (WSN), internet of things (IoT), and data-centric programming. The resulting language allows programmers to write, for each of these domains, event-driven network programs that use global data structures to describe network-wide behavior, without having to handle unexpected data races during program execution on the (distributed) switches. Additionally, the project implements a compiler that produces executable code from an extended event net: specifically, the compiler automatically constructs a network program's distributed version that targets modern hardware such as Barefoot Network's Tofino chip. The second research thurst focuses on formalizing event nets. The project investigates an algebraic formalization of the extended event nets language, allowing (mechanized) formal reasoning about dynamic, stateful network programs. Finally, the project explores ways in which event nets can be used as a pedagogical tool in teaching undergraduate classes on Computer Networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, headwater streams play an important role in controlling the biological and chemical quality of waters that are ultimately delivered to large rivers and communities downstream. This study examines changes in carbon and the movement of carbon at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in tropical headwater streams. This project will examine the fluxes of carbon dioxide from different terrestrial and aquatic landscape elements such as upland areas, wetlands, and streams. The results of this project will have direct implications for the natural resource management of high-elevation watersheds that are the source of drinking water for millions of people in South America. Through a partnership with the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, NC, this project will design and implement educational activities directed at large and diverse audiences, including populations that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. This work will enhance the college research experience of underrepresented students in science while empowering them to serve as ambassadors in their local communities. The students will participate in an international research experience focused on hydrological and ecological data collection, and will be supported through a research-intensive, year-long program focusing on increasing their long-term career success.<br/><br/>A growing body of work recognizes inland waters as fundamental players in the carbon cycle. In particular, headwater streams are known to remove terrestrial carbon in the form of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and as dissolved organic, inorganic, or particulate forms downstream. This study seeks to quantify the role of hydrologic connectivity across multiple landscape elements (i.e., uplands, floodplains, wetlands, and streams) on regulating the partitioning between atmospheric and downstream carbon losses. The study will be conducted in an ecosystem where both water fluxes and carbon storage per unit area are among the highest on Earth: the Andean Paramos of Ecuador. Results from this research will provide a comparison of carbon dioxide effluxes across terrestrial and aquatic landscape elements on a per unit area (or per unit time) basis and as a function of the hydrologic wetness status of the year. The broader impacts of this project include the design and implementation of educational activities directed at large and diverse audiences, including populations that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. After successfully completing field, outreach, and professional development activities, participating undergraduate students will receive a research designation on their transcript and graduate as Carolina Research Scholars. Materials from this work will be used to develop teaching lectures for different audiences, including K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), whose membership includes the major mathematics and statistics societies, will host a conference to initiate a national effort bridging the gaps between high school and college mathematics. The specific goal of this conference will be the creation of state-based teams---incorporating leaders in K-12, two-year colleges, and the state's higher education system---that will coordinate action to improve the articulation of high school through post-secondary mathematics education. The conference will be followed by an 18- month period of networking and support, leading to a second forum to report on progress, accomplishments, and obstacles encountered. The project will result in a synthesis of the states' action plans to be shared broadly and serve as a guide for other states. The formal assessment of their progress will produce information that will be extremely valuable to other states. By facilitating better communication and articulation across the high school to college divide and paying attention to the personal and social skills that often impede student progress, we should see the implementation of programs that create improved student readiness for post-secondary education and improved success. This program has the potential for broad impact across all categories of students, with particularly strong implications for students who are currently at most risk, including students from under-resourced schools, from under-represented minorities, and those who are in their family's first generation to go to college. These are the students who are most at risk and who would benefit the most from well-crafted state-based efforts to improve this articulation. This project is supported with funding from the Discovery Research PreK-12 and Improving Undergraduate STEM Education programs. <br/><br/>This effort will build on the existing work by the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas, Austin, and will draw on recent reports and recommendations of CBMS member societies. The conference will be built around 20 to 25 state-based teams, each team representing the state's department of education, the flagship university and higher education system, and the two-year college system. Teams will also draw on state leaders who have been engaged in efforts to improve mathematics education at either the high school or college level. This forum, planned for spring of 2019, will bring together teams from the participating states to learn what other states have done; to get acquainted with the recommendations, programs, and supports that are available; and to plan their own course of action. The large-scale and multi-venue effort at implementation that will be conducted as follow-up to this conference provides a unique opportunity to study these issues and learn strategies that are effective within different state contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas many once assumed that modernization and urbanization would be accompanied by secularization, faith-based movements and their political effects have only become more relevant worldwide. Religious politics have not only transformed the political sphere; politicization has also changed religion and religious practices. This project, which trains an anthropology graduate student in methods of scientifically rigorous and empirical data collection and analysis, explores what impact the institutionalization of religion in government has on transforming the public sphere, urban space, and practices of piety. By examining the effects of governance on religious practices, urban planning, capitalism, tourism, and identity, the project advances our understanding of modernity and state-building in socio-religious contexts. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, contributes the education of underrepresented groups, and builds capacity and scientific infrastructure through international cooperation in these scientific research communities.<br/><br/>The Fellow, under the supervision of Dr. Hussein Agrama of the University of Chicago, proposes to explore how shrine pilgrimage and its material relationship to shifting practices of governance, religious pilgrimage, and piety impact the organization of urban space, cultural beliefs about modernity, and conceptions of self and community. This project examines how institutionalization of religion has affected popular practices of religiosity, specifically a network of shrines in a range of urban and non-urban settings with varying levels of state political oversight. The research will be conducted at three sites (in major city, a secondary city that is known for its shrine, and a city that has been rebranded as a hub for religious tourism). Utilizing interviews, participant-observation, and archival, research will investigate how pilgrims, locals, urban planners, architects, and other stakeholders understand the transformation of these sites. This research will contribute to debates in political anthropology about governance, theories in the anthropology of religion about pilgrimage, mobility, and tourism, and analyses in urban anthropology about space and sectarian identity. Findings from this research will provide insight into how religious politics are lived on the ground and how the administrative and bureaucratic practices of governance in a modern state transform the role of religion in public life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, state-of-the-art energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries have insufficient energy density and are too costly for broad use in these applications. Battery electrodes based on multivalent ions (e.g., aluminum ions or zinc ions) yield significant enhancements in electric charge storage capacity over monovalent (e.g., lithium-ion) electrodes. When paired with their corresponding metal electrodes, potentially transformative gains in energy density are possible. However, multivalent battery performance to date is lacking, in large part due to limited fundamental understanding and control of the complex electronic, chemical, and structural changes that the electrodes undergo upon continued charge and discharge cycles. Research efforts in this project will investigate the fundamental electrochemical processes that occur during the use of multivalent electrodes, yielding insights into how to design and realize rechargeable batteries with significantly enhanced energy storage properties. Rechargeable aluminum-ion and zinc-ion electrodes will be investigated as both aluminum and zinc metals are earth abundant, low-cost, non-flammable, non-toxic, and exhibit high volumetric charge storage capacity. The project also includes outreach efforts that will advance STEM education at the high school level by directly interacting with high school science teachers at a local high school via a ""Battery Bootcamp"". Outreach will stress the co-development of hands-on, age appropriate laboratory experiments for the high school students to use to help understand electrochemical engineering concepts. The project also will conduct a NMR School within the City University of New York (CUNY) for graduate students to incorporate this technique and other advanced spectroscopic methods to enrich their own respective research projects.<br/><br/>The scientific and technological objectives of this research project are to (i) understand, up from the atomic scale, the processes and properties underpinning electrochemical intercalation of multivalent cations in crystalline transition metal compounds and (ii) to use this understanding to discover and optimize novel intercalation electrodes with significantly enhanced bulk energy storage properties. Aluminum-ion (Al3+) and zinc-ion (Zn2+) intercalation electrodes will be investigated to leverage the favorable electrochemical properties of aluminum and zinc metal while enabling the effects of differing ion valence and charge density to be studied. The electronic and crystalline structures of model transition metal compounds will be systematically varied, enabling investigations of their relationships to electrochemical intercalation phenomena from the molecular to the cell level. Subsequently, knowledge gained from model studies will be used to initiate targeted materials discovery efforts, wherein new electrode compositions and structures will be synthesized and explored for next-generation aluminum-ion and zinc-ion batteries. Novel multi-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods will yield new insights into the atomic-level environments, structures, and dynamics of intercalated cations and electrode frameworks, revealing ion intercalation and charge transfer mechanisms. Overall, this work is expected to establish and validate molecular design principles aimed at realizing multivalent intercalation electrodes with enhanced charge storage capacities, intercalation potentials, and rate properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We use memory to find our way around, to detect a familiar face in a crowd, and to keep track of our ideas as we speak and write. One powerful way that memory can affect so many of our behaviors is by helping to guide what we pay attention to. For example, in a messy kitchen, you can use your memory for where mugs are typically stored in order to find one. Therefore, although memory is often studied for its own sake - for example, to understand how we are able to reminisce about the past, or how that process can go wrong - it is also critically important to understand how we can use memory in the service of guiding our attention and actions. The goal of this project is to understand how the functioning of the human brain enables us to use memories of the past to direct our attention, and the consequences that has for how quickly and accurately we can accomplish tasks. In doing so, this work will highlight the critical importance of memory for moment-to-moment attention. This will fill an important gap in scientific research, which often studies attention and memory in isolation. It will highlight the fundamentally interactive nature of our past and current experiences, with implications for how learning and remembering in educational settings can affect attention and future learning in a feedback loop.<br/><br/>This project therefore seeks to determine the neural mechanisms by which memories guide attention, focusing on the memories stored in a key brain region that is critical for building new memories and retrieving old ones: the hippocampus. This will be accomplished in two Aims, which use multiple methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging, studies of patients with brain lesions, eye tracking, and measures of behavioral accuracy and response times. In Aim 1, the project will determine the neural circuits for memory-guided attention and their relationship to behavior. The main hypothesis is that a brain network including the hippocampus and prefrontal and visual cortices allows us to use memory to update attentional goals and anticipate task-relevant information before it appears. This hypothesis will be tested using a novel approach of characterizing interactions between brain regions (representational connectivity), which<br/>enables investigation of synchrony in information content between regions. In Aim 2, this project will establish how memory and attention jointly guide visual exploration. The main hypothesis is that hippocampal memory retrieval of prior attentional goals will influence visual exploration, attention, and memory in novel situations. This work will have innovative implications for education, e.g., the use of eye tracking to identify if students are remembering and attending to relevant information, even if they cannot<br/>verbally describe it. Together, these two Aims will start to uncover the powerful way that memories can influence our in-the-moment attentional behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much attention has been given to how this will affect shelled animals like corals, but acidification also affects the algae that form the base of the ocean food chain. It is possible that future algal communities will look very different than they do today, with potentially negative consequences for fisheries, recreation, and climate. Alternatively, it is possible that these algae will be able to adapt rapidly enough to avoid the worst of it.  This study looks at algae adapting to acidification in real time in the lab, focusing on ""marketplace"" interactions between the algae and the bacteria they live alongside. The researchers also go to sea to learn whether adaptations from the lab experiments are beneficial under real-world conditions. Ultimately, this project is helping scientists better understand how the ocean's most important and most overlooked organisms will respond to the changes humans are causing in their habitat. The researchers also use their scientific work to create fun educational opportunities from grade school to college, including agar art classes where students learn about microbial ecology by ""painting"" with freshly-isolated ocean bacteria.<br/><br/>The effect of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms has been well-studied, but less is known about how changing pH will affect phytoplankton. Previous work showed that the mutualistic interaction between the globally abundant cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and its ""helper"" bacterium Alteromonas broke down under projected future CO2 conditions, leading to a strong decrease in the fitness of Prochlorococcus. It is possible that such interspecies interactions between microbes are important for many ecological processes, but a lack of understanding of how these interactions evolve makes it difficult to predict how important they are. This project is using laboratory evolution experiments to discover how evolution shapes the interactions between bacteria and algae like Prochlorococcus, and how these co-evolutionary dynamics might influence the biogeochemical processes that shape Earth's climate. Four research cruises to the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series are also planned to study how natural algal/bacterial communities respond to acidification, and whether evolved microbes from laboratory experiments have a competitive advantage in complex, natural communities exposed to elevated CO2. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions that can be used to inform models of Earth's oceans and biological feedbacks on global climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genetic engineering and genome editing are important tools used for the study and improvement of crop plants. However, current genetic engineering/editing systems do not work efficiently, or in some cases at all in several crop species/varieties. The inability to genetically engineer certain species of plants, hinders the progress that can be made with related crops. This project is aimed at developing a new system to genetically engineer/edit plants using ultra-small, biodegradable, synthetic particles (nanoparticles).  Development of such a system would enable more rapid advancement in crop genomics research and production of crops with enhanced traits and performance. In addition, the knowledge generated through this research may be utilized in the enhancement of other genome editing applications.  <br/><br/>Genome engineering/editing systems are critical tools for the advancement of plant functional genomics and epigenomics research, and for genomics-based crop improvement efforts.  Major limitations in current plant genome engineering/editing systems - such as genotype dependence, low and variable efficiencies, and/or inability to accomplish integration-free, germline editing have significantly impeded efficient, widespread utilization of these technologies for crop genomics research and genetic improvement applications. To overcome these limitations, and to increase the efficiency and breadth of plant genome editing a nanoparticle-based systems for introducing bioengineering molecular machinery into target cells capable of regenerating germline edited plants is being developed.  The specific aim of the research project is: to demonstrate nanoparticle-mediated delivery of Cas9/sgRNA ribonuleoprotein (RNP) complexes into target cells in a genotype-independent manner, and successful editing of target DNA sequences in plant cells/tissues, as well as regeneration of genome-edited plants. Novel, biodegradeable nanoparticle-based systems (nanocapsule and polyplex) are used to deliver RNPs into optimal plant cell/tissue targets to generate genome-edited plant cells and tissues from which germline edited plants can be recovered. Microscopic, visual and molecular assays will be conducted to determine genome editing success, location, frequency and inheritance. What is learned here can be applied not only to plant systems, but also in non-plant editing applications.

The particular emphasis of this project is to broaden the participation of underrepresented entrepreneurs and scientists in federal innovation research and development programs, specifically the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Partnership for Innovation (PIF) programs. These programs provide funding for scientists and entrepreneurs to develop advanced innovations that have a high level of uncertainty and risk of not resulting in a desired prototype or technological discovery. This project will match underrepresented minorities with resources and individuals that have business and scientific expertise to 1) provide coaching and entrepreneurship training 2) advance the development of ideas for STEM innovations and 3) understand and prepare innovators for the product development stage prior to applying for SBIR or PFI. The project is being disseminated through Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a national nonprofit that has provided career coaching and professional development training to over 5,000 African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American program participants over 15 years to diversify the talent pipelines of more than 100 corporations and social sector organizations. <br/><br/>The proposed project will address barriers of entrepreneurs and scientists from underrepresented backgrounds by providing coaching and pathways to funding for commercializing innovative scientific and technical ideas. Today less than 1% of venture capital-backed entrepreneurs are underrepresented minorities, and ventures with all-Black founding teams received 30-60% of the funding amount acquired by all-White and all Asian venture capital-backed teams. Lack of access to capital and networks have been documented as limiting factors for entrepreneurs, with these factors magnified for entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds. The AWARE EDP program provides opportunities to educate scientists and entrepreneurs through mentorship and coaching on how to develop proof of concepts, test the strength and viability of ideas through informational interviews, understand strategies for success in the tech industry through boot camps with tech partners, and create an action plan for acquiring seed funding. The four goals of this program are the following: 1) provide an entrepreneurship training playbook and coaching to help underrepresented entrepreneurs and scientists create technical innovations; 2) provide participants with mentorship and coaching to develop scientific and technology-based products and services; 3) support SBIR/PFI grant applications and awards of program participants through workshops with program officers and guidance in the application process; and 4) provide access to resources for focus groups, prototype testing, capital introduction and other support services for entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ecosystem has historically been home to highly productive fisheries, including the fishery for Atlantic cod that was critical to the founding of the nation. This ecosystem is now warming at four times the global average rate, and this warming combined with generations of overfishing has led to the collapse of the region's iconic cod fishery. The Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) is the only institution dedicated to understanding the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Scientists at GMRI conduct integrated, interdisciplinary research across the food web, from plankton to people. Beginning in 2019, this team will include students participating in a new NSF REU program. Much of GMRI's field research involves collecting fish ranging in size from juvenile alewife a few centimeters long to 2 meter-long bluefin tuna. These standard-sized chest freezers are now scattered throughout the building, creating an inefficient use of space and energy.<br/><br/>While GMRI is located on the waterfront in Portland, ME, the institute does not have direct access to the water. Furthermore, as the pace of sampling has increased, GMRI has had to add additional capacity to store frozen specimens. This project will fund the construction of a 12'-by-24' floating dock to provide safe access to the water for scientists, students, and marine educators. It will also fund acquisition of a large (8'-by-20') walk-in freezer to provide efficient storage of frozen specimens for research and teaching. The two projects supported by this funding were identified as part of a comprehensive strategic plan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies focused on students from historically underrepresented groups show that participation in undergraduate research experiences improves their persistence in STEM and helps to validate their identity as scientists. Cuesta College, a two-year institution, will provide undergraduate research experiences in multiple STEM disciplines.  As suggested by previous research, it is expected that participating in undergraduate research will increase student engagement, improve their problem-solving skills, increase retention, and improve their success after college. A multi-disciplinary Faculty Inquiry Group will identify best practices and promote the value of undergraduate research to faculty and students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to create a culture of undergraduate research involving multiple STEM disciplines to increase student engagement and better prepare students to succeed. The project will involve faculty from biology, engineering, astronomy, chemistry, and math, who will incorporate course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into their courses. A Faculty Inquiry Group will build a knowledge base about how to offer effective undergraduate research experiences and will use that information to recruit other college faculty to incorporate CUREs into their courses. This core group of interdisciplinary faculty innovators will develop and test research experiences using different settings, modes, and methods. A successful CURE in astronomy will serve as a model to other disciplines and faculty involved in the astronomy CURE will assist CURE-developers in other disciplines. Economics will join the team to connect the project to the social sciences. Measures of student success will include scientific knowledge, understanding of research practices, and sense of belonging to the discipline. The project will provide professional development opportunities to all faculty to share knowledge about effective CURES and to encourage participation. The Faculty will be trained to mentor student researchers and to encourage them to publish or present their results.  College administration will address policies and procedures, such as articulation agreements and faculty workload, to remove barriers to the implementation of undergraduate research experiences. The concept of a robust, college-wide undergraduate research program at a two-year institution is innovative.  The project will monitor changes in faculty perceptions and attitudes about undergraduate research experiences and document challenges and benefits of implementing CUREs, which may include affects on faculty workload, advancement, and job satisfaction. Results of this project can provide insights about the capacity of community colleges to implement and expand CUREs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The heart of the program is a group of scientists and students who do experiments and measure the many ways that forests change over time. They are especially interested in how forests are linked to society. In the next six years they will study how forests respond to changes in climate, the spread of invasive species, and use of land by humans. Scientists will start some new studies and continue others, all connected by what they'll reveal about how and why forests change over time. Many of the studies have been designed in partnership with natural resource professionals to ensure that they help solve real-world problems. Scientists will mentor college students from many backgrounds, who will work together in interdisciplinary teams. The students will learn new skills and collect important data. Public school teachers and students in their classrooms will also be engaged through activities at Harvard Forest. <br/><br/>Data from a network of permanent forest plots will continue to document long-term changes in forest characteristics and provide validation sites for three eddy-flux towers, multiple remote sensing observations, and an integrated modeling framework. This network will be augmented by a new system of soil ecology plots and a 35-hectare stem-mapped forest dynamics plot. Collectively, the plot-based studies will be used to describe the drivers of primary production, composition, and structure across broad scales of space and time. To understand the consequences of observed trends in climate and atmospheric chemistry, the LTER program will continue to support a long-running suite of soil warming and chronic nitrogen addition experiments.  In addition, paleoecological studies, based on analysis of pollen in lake cores and of tree rings, will be coupled to simulation models to test hypotheses related to the long-term influence of climate on forests. The researchers will build upon their 20-year history of studying hemlock-decline due to an invasive insect by including observations of the changes in belowground microbial communities, stream biochemistry, and the regional pattern of hemlock loss based on a 30-year Landsat time-series. Studies to understand the consequences of invasive insects will be expanded to the newly arrived emerald ash borer and the reemergence of gypsy moth. The Harvard Forest continues to maintain some of the world's canonical studies of human land-use impacts on forest ecosystems, spanning the persistent legacies of colonial agriculture to the modern land-use regime. LTER studies of land-use impacts will be expanded to the scale of New England, using diverse remote sensing platforms, forest inventory databases, and spatial modeling, to understand how the spatio-temporal patterns of land use affects forest dynamics. Finally, the LTER program will continue to support the development of a regional simulation framework that projects the individual and interactive effects of global change drivers on the New England landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The systems in these applications need to shrink system components and achieve light weight and high efficiency simultaneously. These goals of power electronic systems can be accomplished by multiple improvements of power modules such as lower loss, higher frequency, higher temperature and downsizing. In order to make breakthrough in these demands for power modules, it is important to replace the device material from Silicon (Si) to the next generation ones such as Silicon-Carbon (SiC) or Gallium Nitride (GaN). Although the low voltage SiC power device is expected to replace the Silicon device with the rapid increase of market adoption of SiC technology, Silicon device are still dominant in high-voltage high-power applications. The goal of this research is to develop the high voltage high current SiC module based on the existing commercially available device technology to enable the use of SiC-based semiconductors in the high-voltage high-power conversion systems. System benefits such as improved efficiency, reduced part count along with reduced size and weight should make this technology attractive for adoption in these applications. The comprehensive nature of this project will also support a multi-faceted program of research training, with impact at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The outcome of this project will be disseminated through the undergraduate and graduate courses to prepare the students for future careers. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to significantly improve the efficiency and power density of high-voltage high-power conversion systems. To achieve the goal, the proposed approach is to replace the high voltage Si IGBT (3.3kV, 4.5kV, 6.5kV) by series and parallel connected low voltage SiC MOSFETs (1.2kV, 1.7kV). Specifically, a game changing and universally applicable standard block of ""series-parallel connected SiC MOSFET"" will be developed with excellent dynamic voltage/current sharing and high reliability. In order to reach this objective, it is worth noting that the series-parallel connections of multiple devices have the following design challenges that must be addressed: unequal static and dynamic voltage/current sharing which is normally due to the part-to-part device parameter variations, the gate loop parasitic differences, the gate resistor tolerance, the isolation level differences and the signal transmission channel to channel delays; immunity to the conventional de-saturation protection for short-circuit failure; excessive voltage ringing due to the additional loop inductance contributed by the connected bus bars between devices. The advanced methods are proposed to be integrated into the block to overcome these challenges. The feasibility and advantages of the standard block will be demonstrated in the power-down-scaled medium voltage drive, medium voltage PV power conversion, Extreme Fast Charging (XFC) station medium voltage power conversion prototypes. Except for that, the technology will be applied to GaN device to form high voltage high current GaN module competing with the single SiC MOSFET as well and the efficiency/density benefits will be demonstrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will focus on dietary iron, which is vital for life, but also presents hazards, including its availability to pathogens as well as an individual host's own cells. Hosts have evolved multiple mechanisms to withhold iron from infectious agents, and infectious agents, such as bacteria, have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms to acquire iron from their hosts, resulting in an evolutionary ""arms race"" over iron. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about this ""arms race"" in a human population with high pathogen load, to understand how diet, iron nutrition, infection risk, and growth and development are related, and how humans may have adapted to high pathogen environments. The research findings may also inform public health efforts to address iron nutrition and deficiency. This international collaboration will include both field and laboratory training opportunities for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including groups under-represented in science. <br/><br/>This project evaluates the impact of iron status on immunity and infection among children in a population with high rates of iron deficiency and infectious disease. Over the course of one year, participating children will be evaluated monthly for measures of diet, growth and development, iron intake, immune function and infection. The relative importance of diets as causes of iron deficiency and anemia will be described. The prevalence of impaired cell-mediated immunity and incidence of infectious diseases will be compared across iron status groups.

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ?black box'. This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. <br/><br/>This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will revise existing STEM curricula at Old Dominion University to be compatible with requirements for middle school STEM licensure in at least two of three areas: mathematics, science, and technology.  The project also seeks to continue a partnership with Tidewater Community College and pursue stronger relationships with local area schools: Chesapeake City Public Schools, Norfolk City Public Schools, Portsmouth City Public Schools, Suffolk City Public Schools, and Franklin County Public Schools. Three additional partners will also be targeted: Thomas Nelson Community College, Norfolk State University, and the National Institute of Aerospace - Center for Integrative STEM Education. <br/><br/>In addition to establishing these important partner relationships in preparation for development of a Noyce Track 1 proposal, the primary activities of the project will be curriculum revision and needs assessment. The proposed curriculum revisions aim to prepare middle school teachers for licensure in science and mathematics. The revision process will be applied to the Ocean and Earth Science major and refined for use with additional STEM majors. Changes will occur in upper-division science courses as well as elective mathematics courses, which will be re-designed to focus on depth of content relevant for middle school teachers. Extensive needs assessment will examine existing data, conduct semi-structured interviews, and survey a large stratified sample of high school students, community college students and alumni, and current undergraduates regarding needs and barriers with respect to pursuit of careers in teaching. The new knowledge gained by these activities will be disseminated to support both local recruiting efforts and research on STEM teacher preparation. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.

Previous research suggests that decisions about weapons technologies are driven mainly by security concerns or financial needs, but such factors cannot explain current patterns of weapons development across nations. This project will instead test the theory that the ways in which those involved in war and weapons development in each nation (i.e. military personnel, scientists, private firms, etc.) conceptualize future warfare shapes the kinds of weapons that they seek to design and procure. This theory will be tested in relation to the development and procurement of aircraft carriers, stealth technology, and autonomous weapons in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and India. Data for testing the theory will come from analyses of military documents in national archives, in-depth interviews with key figures in each nation, and a survey experiment designed to uncover how decisions are made regarding military budgets and weapons procurement.<br/><br/>This is a multi-method investigation of how and why nation states decide to create and procure different types of weapons technologies. It focuses on interactions among military personnel, politicians, scientists, private firms, and civil society organizations. The main contention is that these actors' conceptions of future warfare shape their choices about weapons procurement. Thus, each set of actors' identity, belief about the state of future conflict, and receptiveness to and interpretation of the laws and ethics of warfare shape the technical solutions that they will propose to different types of security threats. The extent to which these technological solutions are then transformed into weapons systems is predicted to be determined by the extent to which each set of actors has access to the decision-making process and the extent to which their ideas resonate with those of decision makers. The predicted result of interplay among these factors is that even when faced with similar threats, states end up making different choices regarding weapons procurement. This theory of weapons technology design and procurement will be tested by comparing archival, interview, and experimental data from the United States, United Kingdom, France, and India.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most river deltas host vast marshes that are biodiversity hotspots, productive fisheries, effective storm protection, and that capture and store significant amounts of carbon. The processes by which river deltas and marshes grow and collapse as a function of rising sea level and sediment input are well known in isolation. However, there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how marshes and deltas interact. Do feedbacks between marsh and delta dynamics fundamentally influence the behavior of both? The researchers will build laboratory scale deltas subject to controlled environmental conditions that will interact with a newly developed marsh proxy that mimics key marsh properties at a reduced scale. These experiments will help reveal how river deltas and marshes interact over hundred to thousand year timescales under simple conditions, and provide insight into the land loss and subsidence problems that are currently affecting the Mississippi and other global river deltas. The project will broadcast experiments into K-12 classrooms in Louisiana, train a diverse group of researchers at University of Arkansas and Tulane University, and translate results into articles designed for public consumption through social media platforms.<br/><br/>The researchers will study how river deltas and marshes interact using physical laboratory experiments that will incorporate a novel marsh proxy. This marsh proxy will be added to deltaic experiments following a rule-based model of sedimentation based on the local elevation of the evolving deposit. For the first time, this will allow them to document how the internal dynamics of deltas are augmented by marshes that cover vast swaths of many delta plains. Through comparison to prior experiments that evolved in the absence of marshes, they will isolate surface dynamics, compactional subsidence patterns, and stratigraphic products of marsh-delta coupling. Quantitative theory developed in this study will aid prediction of marsh and deltas sustainability in the coming decades and enhance ability to interpret their strata for paleo-environmental records.  Research will be conducted by a diverse team (in gender, ethnicity, and career stage) including undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to K-12 students.

During pregnancy, the workload of the heart increases, and the total volume of blood in the body rises by 40 percent to accommodate circulation in the placenta. Such an immense increase in cardiac workload has been shown to cause changes in the shape and structure of the heart valves. Currently, it is not clearly understood how changes in the mechanical loads on the heart valve during pregnancy lead to such modifications in shape and structure. It is known that the cells in heart valves (and in other soft tissues) try to maintain a stable equilibrium in their mechanical environment. Any deviations from the normal environment can cause cells to respond in an attempt to restore this balance. For example, cells may produce more proteins to build a stiffer and stronger surrounding structure in order to lower the amount of mechanical strain they experience. In this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project, the PI combines experimental measurements and computer simulations to determine how changes in the heart's output and mechanical loading affect the tricuspid valve (the least understood valve in the heart) at the cellular level. The project is expected to widely impact the field of biomechanics, society in general, and engineering education. Specifically, this research project is expected to add knowledge of how mechanical loading affects cells and their surrounding structure, which is useful for future studies of the heart valves and other soft tissue. It will also provide useful information about how valve dysfunctions are brought on by pulmonary hypertension, which is a major cause of tricuspid valve disease in the broader public as well as in pregnant women. The educational goals include engaging K-12 students via hands-on STEM activities involving heart biomechanics during summer camp programs and monthly mentoring sessions at the University of Akron.  The PI will also incorporate the research outcomes into courses offered at the University of Akron as well as supplementary educational materials (including relevant homework assignments) in articles submitted to scholarly journals for circulation to the scientific community. <br/><br/>This project has three scientific objectives.  First, to measure the effects of cardiac output, loading environment, and extracellular matrix composition on the macroscale mechanical response, microscale extracellular matrix realignment, and cell nuclei of tricuspid valves before and after pregnancy in a bovine model.  Second, to develop a mechanistic, multi-scale finite element model to connect the mechanical environment of the organized collagen and elastin components, the disorganized matrix, and the cells to the tissue-level mechanical loading/deformation in tricuspid valves before and after pregnancy.  Next, to test the hypothesis that the complex valve geometry and the complex microstructure of the extracellular matrix provide a uniform homeostatic mechanical environment at the cellular/extracellular matrix level in response to the chances in physiological mechanical loading that occurs during and after pregnancy, along with the hypothesis that the alteration in the valves following pregnancy is a mechanobiological remodeling response to restore the tissue towards its pre-pregnancy mechanical state.  And finally, to test the hypothesis that to restore the homeostatic mechanical environment, proteins that contribute to the stiffness of the extracellular matrix and nuclei are more prevalent in tricuspid valves during pregnancy. The educational objective is to inspire pre-collegiate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to pursue higher education and careers in STEM as well as to inspire appreciation of multi-scale biomechanics within a general audience. This will be accomplished by: 1) developing a summer camp outreach program for K12 students that includes hands-on STEM activities; 2) implementing monthly mentorship clinics at the University of Akron for pre-collegiate students; 3) developing YouTube and iTunes videos to show experiments and simulations related to multi-scale biomechanics.  In addition, the research results will be integrated into classroom materials that will be used at the University of Akron and disseminated more broadly through publication in engineering education journals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An adversary can exploit the connections between the layers and launch an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack that is accomplished through a set of multi-stage stealthy and continuous hacking processes.  Lessons learned from APT attacks have highlighted the fact that the design for perfect security is not always possible or prohibitively expensive, and hence resilience is an equally important mechanism that can complement the imperfect security. The standard analysis tools are insufficient to cope with the complexity of CPS and address the design of security and resilience mechanisms.  To this end, the project aims to establish an integrated game-theoretic framework that adopts both reductionist and integrative approaches to engineer high-confidence CPS. The proposed research uses electric power systems and the cloud-enabled autonomous systems as two case studies to illustrate the designs of cyber defense strategies, resilience control mechanisms, and CPS security-aware contracts as the holistic cyber, physical, and human solution to for next-generation high-confidence infrastructure systems. <br/><br/>The methodologies developed in the project establish an inter-disciplinary system science to conceptualize and design high-confidence CPS, and expedite the realization of CPS in a wide range of applications including transportation, industrial automation, and the power grid. The project first leverages system engineering principles to create game motifs or gamelets as building blocks and use them to compose a game of games or meta-game to model heterogeneous interactions of system components within the layers, across the layers, and with an adversary. As the perfect security at the cyberspace is not always possible, the project develops a resilient control mechanism to provide an alternative paradigm of protection by maintaining critical functions of the CPS and mitigating the impact of cyber insecurity on the physical layer. At the socio-economic level, the proposed CPS contracts aim to create an incentive-compatible secure provision of CPS services and mitigate security risks by incentivizing proper security management of the service providers and reducing the risks of the users. The research is fully integrated into the educational plan via the incorporation of new courses as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students via mentoring, participation in test-bed development, special projects, and internships at research labs. The educational tool will foster this integration via new hands-on activities and demonstrations to a broader community.

To date, these efforts have focused on modifying E. coli.  Other bacteria exhibit more complex behavior than E. coli. One example of this is swarming. E. coli is capable of localized swarming, similar to a flock of birds all flying together in a particular direction. Other bacteria are capable of forming more complex patterns. One example is the formation of periodic ring patterns that can be easily observed visually. The basic idea behind the project is both simple and powerful. If bacteria can be designed to swarm, forming rings in response to a specific signal, the cells can act as a sensor that can be observed easily. The signals could be viruses, toxic chemicals, or dangerous pathogens. These bacteria could then provide a low cost, easily observed method of detection that could be used around the world to help identify and avoid diseases or other toxic agents. The project will also advance STEM education and diversity at several levels. STEM + arts (STEAM) workshops will be developed and run. Students will be recruited to participate in research. In addition, biology-based artworks will be presented to the general public.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to engineer bacterial swarming to generate macroscopic patterns. We hope to create a spatially-encoded biosensor. The first step will be to engineer E. coli gene circuits to create synthetic swarming motility on solid agar. This will help us understand how to control swarming behavior and pattern formation from the bottom-up. A top-down effort will modulate natural swarming behavior in other organ-isms. This will also create a synthetic biology toolkit for these organisms. Finally, these organisms and E. coli will be engineered to record a transient signal by permanently modulating pattern formation. These biosensors will then be applied to the detection of parasites. The biosensor readout will produce patterns at the scale of a Petri dish and easily detectable by eye. Thus, this readout will be invaluable for use in low-resource settings. The complementary bottom-up and top-down approaches will provide fundamental insight into the use of microbial hosts and behaviors as sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since this discovery antibiotics have been a boon for human health as well as for agricultural livestock production. In fact, the latter utilizes 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States, a staggering 33 million pounds a year. Most of these antibiotics and antibiotic derivatives ultimately enter the environment, leading to the assertion that no environment on earth is free from the influence of agricultural antibiotics. Despite this, little research has examined the environmental influence agricultural antibiotics are likely to have, for example, on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they mediate. This research will determine the effect antibiotics have on soil food webs and ecosystem processes both now and in an uncertain future. While examining the environmental implications of antibiotics, this project will include training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels, and develop an authentic, expeditionary style curriculum that can be integrated across multiple middle schools which enables students to actively participate in research. <br/><br/>Using a combined set of survey, field, and lab experiments this research will determine: 1) biogeographic patterns of the soil resistome (i.e. the collection and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes); 2) the implications of antibiotics for soil food webs and ecosystem processes; and 3) the interaction between antibiotic inputs and temperature changes. Soil microbial communities are central to the healthy functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, these communities are likely to be markedly affected by antibiotic inputs derived from exogenous sources. For instance, antibiotic inputs may alter microbial efficiency leading to lower ecosystem carbon and nutrient retention, affect soil food web structure and community interactions, and potentially influence the response of soil microbial communities to global environmental change. This research is designed to investigate the potentially important, but under-studied, role antibiotic inputs have on terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, this research seeks to better understand the susceptibility of particular soil communities and ecosystem function to antibiotic perturbation. The results gained from this research will lead to a more complete understanding of the potential impact antibiotic inputs have on soil community structure and function, and the implication of these inputs in the future. In addition to training a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, the educational component of this project will expose middle school students -- a student population that is at a critical juncture in deciding their lifetime career objectives, but often not actively engaged in science -- to multiple curricular modules that aim to increase their knowledge of soil, microbial, and ecosystem ecology. These young students will also be active participants in the project by collecting data and conducting research directly related to the scientific objectives of this project. Overall this project will elucidate the environmental implications of antibiotics while also providing a foundation in scientific discovery for middle school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project will also produce an integrated system of printer control software and printhead design for production of parts with the polyurethane precursor formulas. The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification. Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry, and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material  will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technological advances are stimulating the rapid emergence of new-generation large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), including the smart grid, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, medical device networks and mobile robotic networks. CPS consists of a large number of geographically dispersed entities and thus distributed data sharing is necessary to achieve network-wide goals. However, distributed data sharing also raises the significant concern that the private or confidential information of legitimate entities could be leaked to unauthorized entities. Privacy has become an issue of high priority to address before certain CPS can be widely deployed. Existing techniques to protect the data privacy of ICT systems are not sufficient to ensure CPS privacy. This project will develop new control-theoretic schemes to assure the successful completion of control tasks for large-scale CPS and simultaneously preserve the privacy of legitimate entities. The outcomes of this project will provide engineering guidelines to build trustworthy CPS in adversarial operating environments. The proposed activities on education and outreach will contribute to training an energetic generation of skilled professionals and engineers with multidisciplinary background to satisfy the rapid growth of CPS.<br/><br/>This project will systematically study CPS privacy from a fresh control-theoretic perspective. The proposed research will develop new schemes by leveraging technical tools of two disparate domains: (1) decision and control (control theory, optimization, game theory, distributed algorithms); (2) computer science (data privacy, cryptography). The new schemes will achieve mathematically provable privacy and control-theoretic performance. The research agenda consists of three thrusts: (i) developing new homomorphic encryption schemes to solve distributed optimization problems where the computation is carried over encrypted data; (ii) designing feedback perturbations on the inputs and outputs of dynamic networks such that network privacy is protected, system utilities; e.g., controllability, are maintained, and the costs caused by the perturbations are minimized; and (iii) evaluating the developed theory using the case studies of power systems, smart buildings and machine learning. The project will involve collaborations with research laboratories in federal, military and industrial sectors. The collaborations will promote technology transfer and make an impact beyond academia. The successful completion of this research will discover the unique role dynamic systems play in CPS privacy, provide the new understandings of the interplay between control theory and data privacy, and enable CPS to operate in a trustworthy manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigator seeks to improve fluorescent dyes to limit toxicity for application to cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The approach will develop a range of organic salts, assess phototoxicity (i.e., toxicity due to light) and then evaluate the chosen contrast agents. Improved imaging agents will be broadly useful and preliminary data suggest a reduction in phototoxicity. The research can lead to novel fluorescent probes for broad societal impact ranging from biomedicine and diagnostics to solar cells by enabling selective photodynamic therapy without side effects; brighter medical imaging that penetrate deeper into tissue for tumor detection and image-guided surgery.<br/><br/>The principal investigator utilizes a new approach that will pair fluorescent ions with non-fluorescent counterions to independently modulate frontier molecular orbital levels proposed to be responsible for cyto- and photo-toxicity, without modifying optical properties. The principal investigator proposes that the fine-tuning concept can be applied to both novel and commercially available fluorescent probes and will enable precise toxicity modulation of fluorescent probes in eukaryotic cells for a range of applications. The principal investigator will systematically engineer a series of ions that tune optoelectronic properties of fluorescent organic salts by modulating the degree of halogenation, steric bulk, and dipole moments. The central hypothesis will test if fluorescent organic salts provide cytotoxic and phototoxic tunability through counterion coupling by generating resonant reactive oxygen species via charge injection in cellular environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior work with a small sample of only men found that it is possible to predict behavioral performance in such tasks based on the thickness of the cortex in a part of the brain that responds preferentially to faces. Importantly, the manner in which face and non-face recognition abilities were predicted by brain structure was different, with individuals with thicker cortex being better at recognizing vehicles than those with thinner cortex, while individuals with thinner cortex performing better in face recognition tasks. In addition, for faces, only the thickness of the deeper, early developing, layers of the cortex predicted performance. This research will test whether these results replicate in a larger sample of men and women. It will investigate how connections between face-selective cortex and other parts of the brain sensitive to  social interactions could help explain how early experience with faces influences the thickness of deep cortical layers. A better understanding of how the structure of the brain relates to visual abilities could extend predictions to a wide range of occupations such as forensics, medical imaging, and homeland security. The work could also transform how we study cortical development in neurological disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The project will improve participation of underrepresented middle and high school students from Nashville public schools and increase scientific literacy, via the team's contributions to the School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt.<br/><br/>This research seeks to advance our understanding of how the cortical microstructure of visual areas relates to individual differences in visual abilities. Using ultra-high resolution imaging at 7 Tesla and state-of-the-art psychometric measurement of visual abilities, the project will replicate and extend findings relating visual recognition of faces and objects to the laminar structure of cortex in the fusiform face area (FFA). The project will also test for replication of the relation between one's social network size and the size of the amygdala (AMG), and test whether AMG size mediates the correlation between face recognition and the thickness of FFA's deep layers. The work will generalize prior findings with men to a sample of women, expand behavioral testing to new object categories, and compare laminar effects in FFA to those in other visual areas. Studying the neuromarkers of visual abilities can increase our understanding of brain-behavior relationships beyond already successful domains like general intelligence or health-related behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The light that reflects from a visible surface toward the point of observation is influenced by several factors. These include the surface shape, the pattern of illumination, and the nature of the surface material. The problem for perceptual theory is to explain how it is possible to tease apart these separate influences in order to make reliable judgments about each one. This project is designed to investigate how this is achieved by human observers. There are many potential benefits of this research. The accurate perception of shape and material properties are important for many basic human functions, such as grasping objects or judging whether visible surfaces are appropriate to afford safe locomotion. A better understanding of these processes may help to facilitate training to avoid injury due to falling. It could also lead to improved 3D visualization in medical devices, or aids for visually impaired individuals that can detect slippery spots or irregular terrain features in the path of locomotion. <br/><br/>The first specific aim of this proposal is to measure how the perception of 3D shape is influenced by changes in surface material (e.g., glass, wax or plastic) or the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved by measuring local 3D orientation at numerous probe points on an object, from which it possible to compute a best fitting surface that is most consistent with an observer's judgments. The second specific aim is to measure how the perceptual categorization of surface materials is influenced by changes in 3D shape and the pattern of illumination. This will be achieved using a novel categorization task in which observers are shown a shaded object, and are required to adjust a set of sliders to indicate their confidence that the depicted material is one of several possible material categories. The stimuli for these experiments will be created using state-of-the-art computer graphics to produce physically accurate simulations of real materials. The results of this research will greatly improve our current understanding of the specific computational mechanisms by which patterns of image shading provide information for perceiving the 3D shapes of objects and the identification of their material properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, machine learning and crop modeling are among the most commonly used approaches for yield prediction. This award supports fundamental research to combine the strengths of machine learning and crop models. Machine learning algorithms will be used to predict intermediate plant traits, which will then be fed into a crop model to predict grain yields across different environment and field management practices. Both conception and execution of this EAGER project depend on collaborations across multiple disciplines, including high-throughput phenotyping, object recognition, machine learning, optimization, computer simulation, and crop modeling. If successful, this research is expected to improve not only accuracy but also interpretability of yield prediction models, which will open numerous opportunities for downstream research and discoveries. The interdisciplinary effort will enhance the impact of science and engineering education across disciplines, while providing a collaborative and inclusive environment for all students to engage in cutting edge research activities.<br/><br/>Underlying yield prediction is one of the grand challenges of biology: understanding how phenotype is determined by genotype, environment, and their interactions. Machine learning algorithms are able to predict crop phenotype to reasonable accuracy based on genotype information, but most models have a black box structure and their results are hard to interpret. On the other hand, crop models offer biological insights into causes of phenotypic variation by providing explicit explanations of the interactions between traits and environmental conditions in different phases of the crop growth cycle, but the collection of trait measurement data and calibration of model coefficients are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. The proposed approach is a nested model. Deep learning algorithms will be trained to predict leaf appearance rate from genotype and empirically measured trait data. Training data will be extracted from images of plant leaves obtained via field experiments that employ novel phenotyping technique. Next, the resulting predicted traits and environment data will be fed into the crop model to predict yield. If proven effective, this approach can be applied to study other plant traits to improve crop yield prediction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermal transport across these interfaces affects heat dissipation, and a better understanding of these thermal properties is needed to reduce electronic operating temperatures. Directly manufacturing heat removal devices onto semiconductor substrates can lead to substantial energy savings and a reduction in toxic electronic waste. The added reliability due to improved cooling will be especially valuable in failure-intolerant applications such as space, defense, and medical devices. This research considers the manufacture of heat removal layers directly onto electronic devices. The thermal transport in intermetallic-semiconductor interfaces versus solid-solution alloy-semiconductor interfaces will be studied. Additional tasks are to improve interfacial conductance through laser exposures and to determine whether increasing mechanical interfacial strength increases thermal transport. This project is integrated with educational activities at the K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate levels. A primary outreach activity, titled ""Heat Transfer Thru Additive Manufacturing"", uses hands-on experiments to teach K-12 students, largely from underrepresented groups, about the three modes of heat transfer.  <br/><br/>Intermetallics form via direct additive manufacture of high-thermal-conductivity heat-removal devices on semiconductor substrates, as used in microprocessors and power electronics. However, the thermal properties of intermetallics are poorly understood and cannot be predicted from base metal thermal conductivity, unlike solid-solution alloys with Nordheim?s relation. Recent research indicates that silicides (a type of intermetallic) have excellent thermal conductance with silicon, but no other intermetallic-semiconductor interfacial conductances have been reported. This research investigates the nature of intermetallic-semiconductor interfaces versus solid-solution alloy-semiconductor thermal interfaces.  Furthermore, the project explores whether defects induced by quenching at 107 ?C/sec can be relieved by multiple laser exposures that grow the intermetallic grain boundaries and relieve defects. The relation between interfacial mechanical properties and interfacial thermal conductance are also examined. Samples are prepared by selective laser melting of specially designed alloys to form intermetallics on the semiconductor surface. Thermal characterization is performed with a frequency-domain thermoreflectance tool. The relationship between mechanical properties and thermal conductance has only been examined for a few systems, so this research expands knowledge of different intermetallic-semiconductor systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Batteries are the linchpin technology for multiple economic sectors, including consumer electronics, transportation, and electric power systems. However, today's battery management systems use simplistic models, which have raised serious performance and safety issues. For example, significant electrification of the U.S. vehicle fleet will require fast charging and long-range batteries. Simultaneously, we must ensure safety, as evidenced by recent cases where batteries have caught fire. Future battery management systems will address these deficiencies and unlock increased performance and safety by utilizing high-fidelity multi-physics models. However, the electrochemical-thermal model dynamics present unsolved challenges for estimation and control. The research goal of this project is to resolve  these challenges and generate results that will enable current and future batteries with more energy, more power, faster charge times, and longer life. The educational goal of this project is to enhance retention and performance among students from underrepresented, low-income, and first-generation backgrounds. This will be achieved through a ""Maker Design Studio,"" which will train over 600 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students to become the next generation of energy and control engineering leaders.<br/><br/>Batteries are characterized by multi-physics mathematical models, often involving nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), limited sensing and actuation, and significant parameter uncertainty. This project pursues three research goals, motivated by batteries yet in pursuit of fundamental systems and control challenges: (1) Formulate and analyze a parameter estimation framework, based on a data selection approach that resolves the identifiability problem. Online battery parameter (i.e. state-of-health) estimation has remained elusive, due to fundamental identifiability challenges. (2) Experimentally quantify the benefits of an electrochemical model-based battery management system in terms of fast charge times and capacity loss. Today, it is unclear if rigorously designed electrochemical model-based management systems yield significant improvements, due to the lack of experimental evidence. This project leverages a unique battery-in-the-loop testbed to reveal the true impact of electrochemical-based management methods. (3) Create a PDE-based analysis, estimation, and control framework for coupled parabolic-hyperbolic PDEs, with application to battery thermal management. Specifically, the project pursues a weak-variations approach to design linear quadratic estimators and controllers. Overall, this project focuses on fundamental advancements to estimation and control that will accelerate a paradigm shift toward multi-physics control-theoretic battery management systems that will enable a new generation of energy storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Center for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs) facility will offer hands-on training and knowledge dissemination, through its formal designation as a Consortium for the Advancement of the Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Measurement Facility (HMF) Node and formal agreements with CUAHSI to promote two hands-on workshops per year as well as training on both the OSU and UNR campuses. Outreach will also include mission training services for earth sciences users of unmanned aircraft through UNR's Systems Integration Laboratory, and extensive workshops and hackathons to develop a strategy to support dissemination of novel sensing systems to expand the impact of the OPEnS Lab.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the societal relevance of targeted research aimed at understanding global and regional water cycles and climate change impacts with implications for improved water resource management and the impact of the acquisition on training the next generation scientific workforce. <br/><br/>This grant provides operational facility support for a collaborative effort between Oregon State University (PI: Selker) and the University of Nevada Reno (PI: Tyler) to allow for continued/evolving operations over the next four year of CTEMPs. CTEMPs offers community support for 1) planning, training, equipment loan and field implementation using fiber optic Raman backscatter Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS); 2) planning and training for sUAS equipment and missions; and 3) Earth Science community engagement in the development of innovative sensor systems that leverage 3-D printing, contemporary sensors and micro-processors, as well as ubiquitous wireless communication through the a new arm of CTEMPs called the ""Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS)"" Lab. DTS allows for unprecedented observation of the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature for geoscience and environmental applications including but not limited to, snow, groundwater and watershed hydrology, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, karst geology, soil science (including permafrost studies), physical limnology and oceanography, micrometeorology and glaciology. High resolution DTS systems allow for high spatial (<= 0.25 m) and high accuracy (precision to 0.02 oC) observations of river bottom, lake, or estuary bottom, snow pack, soil horizon or atmospheric temperatures over length scales from 0.25 to 10,000 m at high temporal frequency (1 Hz). When placed in a stream or river, fiber optic DTS allows for observation of the location, temperature, and flux of each groundwater inflow, calculation of an exact heat budget to determine hyporheic exchange, and observation of micro-thermal habitats critical to successful larval fish recruitment. CTEMPs DTS systems have been deployed on NSF-funded research projects located on all seven continents and continue to be in demand for hydrologic and earth science field campaigns. Unmanned aircraft support has included photogrammetry, thermal and hyperspectral remote sensing, and future efforts will focus on community training and support. The advent of robust, low-cost sensors, micro-processors, and wireless communication makes possible transformative earth sensing systems, but requires technical expertise that is not common in the earth sciences. Building on a track record of 25 successful projects, OSU will explore the institutionalization of the community infrastructure in the CTEMPs-OPEnS Lab.  CTEMPs-OPEnS will explore how to integrate central technical capabilities and outreach to the earth science communities to accelerate the dissemination and application of transformative measurement systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, linguistic communication takes place in the face of environmental and cognitive constraints. When multiple options are available to express more or less the same meaning, what general principles govern speaker choice? Advancing our understanding of this question can potentially enhance a broad array of human language technologies, such as providing more human-like language generation with better understanding of speaker choice, more accurate machine translation, better resources for language learning and teaching, as well as insights to improve treatment for language disorders. <br/><br/>Within this broader research program, this project focuses on the influence of contextual predictability on the encoding of linguistic content manifested by speaker choice in a classifier language. In English, a numeral modifies a noun directly (e.g., three tables). In classifier languages such as Mandarin Chinese, it is obligatory to use a classifier (CL) with the numeral and the noun (e.g., three CL.flat table, three CL.general table). While different nouns are compatible with different specific classifiers, there is a general classifier 'ge' (CL.general) that can be used with most nouns. This study focuses on the alternating options between using the general classifier versus a specific classifier with the same noun where the options are nearly semantically invariant. The use of a more specific classifier would reduce surprisal at the noun, but the use of that more specific classifier may be dispreferred from a production standpoint if accessing the general classifier requires less effort. This project combines corpus analyses, psycholinguistic behavioral experiments and computational modeling using techniques from statistics, natural language processing, and experimental psychology, examining how language users allocate resources to prepare them to produce and comprehend language, shedding lights on why language is structured in the way it is.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans move, manipulate, and interact with soil on a massive scale for civil construction, mining, and agriculture using machines that have been designed and built primarily through trial and error, without fundamental knowledge of how soils respond under different loading conditions.  Advances in mechatronics and robotics can revolutionize the design of these machines.  Since existing techniques for simulation and design are largely for devices operating on hard surfaces, a major impediment to answering this question and others is the lack of methods to predict how machines operate on deformable terrain.  This project will collect data and launch an integrated research and educational program dedicated specifically to Soil-Machine Interaction (SMI), one that ultimately will examine a wide variety of machine configurations and soil types.  The broader impacts of this project will shape an emerging, interdisciplinary field by stimulating technological advances in the devices used for construction, mining, agriculture, and mobility.  Through integrated educational aims, the project will also attract, excite and educate a diverse group of future civil engineers through inclusive outreach and educational activities that engage learners of all ages, from early childhood onward.<br/><br/>This project will integrate experiments and theory based on fundamental soil mechanics to obtain models for predicting the evolution of forces and reactions as machines come into contact with soils to induce large, permanent (plastic) deformations.  Significant novelty lies in the complete experimental characterization of force-displacement histories and deformation fields over a wide range of possible motions, considering two fundamental soil types and using the 6-axis robotic arm in the Soil-Machine Interaction Laboratory at Northwestern University for actuation.  To overcome the high computational demands of existing numerical methods, the project will formulate an efficient simulation technique based on the Sequential Kinematic Method, an approach that utilizes simplified kinematics and an optimization-based solution scheme to decrease computation times significantly.  Since force-displacement histories obtained experimentally or through numerical simulation are applicable only to a single motion or load path, a significant breakthrough pursued in this project is the formulation of a semi-analytical framework capable of predicting force-displacement histories under arbitrary motions and loading conditions.  Educational and societal impact will be maximized through sustained outreach, training of undergraduate and graduate students, interaction with industry, and dissemination of results internationally across various platforms, including open-source software written in an architecture advised by industry collaborators.  Through collaboration with the Chicago Children's Museum and Chicagoland maker fairs, the project aims to stimulate interest in engineering and SMI across a wide range of demographics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Promotion dropwise condensation on surfaces (instead of a liquid film) can result in significant savings in energy and cost in many applications like those mentioned above. In recent years, hydrophobic, superhydrophobic and liquid infused surfaces have been tested to promote dropwise condensation. However, the performance of such surfaces can get compromised easily by a variety of debilitating mechanisms such as random droplet nucleation within textures (leading to eventual film formation), surface flooding at high humidity, organic contamination, and surface degradation. The goal of this CAREER project is to understand condensation on a class of existing materials that can undergo phase-transition due to condensation itself. Such materials possess several beneficial attributes of solid and liquid surfaces that could be the key to overcome many of the challenges faced by the existing superhydrophobic or liquid infused surfaces. Investigation of condensation on such materials could also clarify the long-standing questions on the fundamentals surrounding phase-change, such as the role of substrate thermal conductivity, condensation rate and relative humidity on the growth of droplets and heat-transfer rates. Results from this research will be integrated with educational activities that seek to increase women/underrepresented-minority student participation in engineering via undergraduate (UG) student recruitment for water harvesting via condensation, and engagement with high-school (HS) students through university outreach program (UIC-CHANCE).<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of this CAREER project is to discover new fundamental knowledge to inform development of coatings for condensation applications based on surfaces that undergo phase-transitions during condensation. This goal will be accomplished by performing comprehensive studies to understand water droplet interactions with phase-transitioning surfaces in absence/presence of condensation to determine the relation between nanoscale transport phenomena (e.g. temperature distribution below/around droplets) and the resulting macroscopic effects (reduced droplet adhesion, delayed droplet freezing on highly subcooled substrate (<<0 oC)) as a function of phase-transition material properties (such as their solid-state surface structure, water miscibility, thermal properties), thermodynamic conditions (the degree of subcooling and relative humidity) and interfacial properties using conventional (optical/IR microscopy) & advanced diagnostic tools (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Phase Contrast Microscopy). As part of such investigations, a new methodology will be developed to measure temperature distribution in the condensing surface beneath droplets with nanoscale spatial resolution. The correlations established from experimental measurements and theoretical models will be supplemented with numerical simulations to elucidate the fundamentals of condensation on the special phase-transitioning surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During migration through tissues, stem cells must crawl through an extracellular matrix with pores that are sometimes 100 to 1,000 times smaller than the cells themselves.  Physiological tissues and their extracellular matrix often exhibit mechanical plasticity, undergoing irreversible deformations in response to mechanical force.  In these tissues, cell generated forces can permanently -- or plastically -- expand pores in the matrix.  Thus, the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, including how mechanically plastic or permanently deformable the matrix is, could play a critical role in regulating stem cell migration. The role of extracellular matrix plasticity in regulating stem cell migration will be investigated in this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) research project.  The research will be integrated with both educational and outreach activities that involve the training of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers. Research results will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate level courses. Teaching modules, including hands-on activities, suitable for high school classrooms and the broader public will be developed on the topics of biomaterials, stiffness, plasticity, and engineering models of living tissues.  This integrated effort will broaden understanding regarding tissue mechanics and stem cell migration.  <br/><br/>This project will investigate how tissue mechanical plasticity regulates stem cell migration.  The researcher hypothesizes that cells, through the generation of forces, can plastically open up pores in the matrix to facilitate migration.  Using biomaterials for 3D culture, 2D culture, and microchannel-based migration assays, this award will test this hypothesis through three research objectives. Objective 1 will examine the impact of matrix mechanical plasticity on stem cell migration in tunable 3D hydrogel matrices developed from both alginate and hyaluronic acid-collagen copolymers.  Cell migration will be tracked and changes to the collagen architecture in the HA-col matrices will be quantified.  Objective 2 will establish the impact of mechanical plasticity on stem cell migration on 2D surfaces and in microchannels using confocal fluorescence microscopy to assess measurements of migration as well as cellular and nuclear morphology.  Objective 3 will elucidate the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that stem cells utilize to migrate through matrices with different levels of mechanical plasticity.  In particular, matrix strains will be measured during migration and correlated with actin dynamics, cell morphologies and volume, and nuclear morphologies.  Finally, 3D migration assays will be repeated while perturbing molecules to determine how they affect migration.  These studies will reveal fundamental new insights into stem cell migration, which will advance knowledge of natural regenerative processes that can then be applied to advance regenerative medicine<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In parallel, automated instruments store massive amounts of measurements. However, computational science will only fulfill its full potential if advances in undergraduate and graduate education accompany the advances in hardware. The 30 undergraduate students participating in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program are engaged with varied computational science projects, learn how to use state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure tools, manage large amounts of data, experience activities that characterize research careers, and work in interdisciplinary research teams. The Center for Computation & Technology (CCT) at Louisiana State University provides an ideal setting for the REU student to become familiar with interdisciplinary research. For ten weeks in the summer, the students work collaboratively with their mentors on a wide variety of computational science projects. With research groups exploring gravitational waves, complex emergent phenomena in material science, or computational music and arts, the participants work on cutting edge research in computational sciences. By preparing the next generation of students in the computational sciences, this project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.<br/><br/><br/>There is a clear need for training the workforce on computing and computational science. But, currently, the majority of students learn little, if any, Computational Science (CSci) in the classroom and are not prepared for CSci research or data science. This proposal provides an evidence-based approach to address these issues and prepare the next generation of students. One of the current barriers in CSci education is that while CSci is intrinsically multidisciplinary, traditional academic departments set rigid boundaries between disciplines. Because LSU Center for Computation & Technology is not an academic unit, it provides an ideal setting for the REU student to become familiar with interdisciplinary research by participating in a multidisciplinary research team. During ten weeks the participants experience activities that characterize research careers, such as presenting their research in scholarly forums, and working on the soft- and hard-skills needed in interdisciplinary research. Faculty mentors work with the students in individual and group meetings, and they provide activities that help students appreciate the nature of multidisciplinary research and the value of working as a team. At the conclusion of the REU, students are encouraged to continue their CSci research and present their work at their home institution, informing others about computational science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest are decompositions into sums of the simple sine and cosine functions.  For functions defined over an interval, or in higher dimensions over a cube, such decompositions are a classical area of study. This project considers functions defined over more complicated sets, and studies the existence of similar decompositions in such settings. The ability to approximate or decompose functions in such a way provides a strong tool for research, which can be applied in various settings. Several applications of this theory will be studied throughout this project. As part of this project, the PI will develop, organize and teach in a new program titled ""Honors level Program in Analysis for Students in the Atlanta Area"". This three-year program, for promising undergraduate students, is expected to increase both the motivation and the potential of its participants to be admitted to leading graduate programs. <br/><br/>It is well known that most measurable sets do not admit an orthogonal basis of exponentials, or of trigonometric functions. Therefore, to use harmonic analysis machinery over such sets, the rigid structure of an orthonormal basis needs to be replaced by the more flexible structure of a Riesz basis, or if this is impossible, by relaxed versions of it such as frames and Riesz sequences. In this project, the PI will continue her study (with collaborators) of such problems. For example, she will analyze questions regarding the existence of Riesz bases of exponentials, and problems related to systems with universal properties. Further, the PI will apply this theory to mathematical problems in several different settings, including sampling and interpolation of band limited signals, extensions and refinements of certain uncertainty principles, and the behavior of Gaussian noise over long intervals of time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second language learning requires significant time to learn material that has not occurred in the individual's prior experience. While this is obvious for foreign language learning, it is less obvious but also true for learning to read. Written and spoken language differ greatly in both their vocabulary and sentence structure, so becoming a fluent reader requires significant reading experience to learn how written language differs from speech. Because poor readers do not engage in this extensive practice, they fall further behind peers who have higher skill. Current instruction methods in both reading and second language learning are inadequate and intervention in both of these areas is in the national interest. Poor literacy is widespread in the US population and is associated with low employment, poor health outcomes, limited participation in society, and higher rates of incarceration. <br/><br/>The project combines memory and learning research to investigate how and why speaking during language learning yields not just better speaking skills but also better written and spoken language comprehension than more traditional reading- and listening-focused curricula. The studies rigorously compare second language learning via speaking vs. listening practice, including whether the learning method influences students' motivation to pay attention, practice, and learn. The studies also examine the link between speaking and short-term or working memory, which is the ability to hold information in mind for short durations. Working memory abilities are thought to be an important component of longer-term learning, including vocabulary learning in a native or foreign language. The same methods will be applied to interventions aimed at improving reading comprehension for poor readers with dyslexia or other sources of low literacy, including inadequate instruction, practice, or barriers from low English skills. The interventions will use spoken language exercises that provide practice with the vocabulary and sentence structure patterns of written language, which are essentially ""foreign"" to a reluctant reader. The aim is to provide key learning opportunities that are crucial to developing reading fluency without always requiring reading practice in which poor readers are reluctant to engage. Both the second language and the reading interventions also investigate students' response to various educational interventions, where students who begin with more knowledge generally get greater benefit from additional instruction, leaving behind those who most need the help. If the speaking interventions provide essential background skills, they could help people with dyslexia and other struggling learners learn from the novel interventions tested in this project and position struggling learners to take advantage of existing instruction in current school curricula.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program, the Science of Learning Program, and the EHR Core Research Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, such dependency provides an opportunity of proactively maneuvering the uncertainty to reinforce the decision making. This CAREER project will evaluate the potential benefit of incorporating decision-dependent uncertainty and investigate new optimization approaches to maneuvering such uncertainty. If successfully implemented in the service industries, the research findings of this project will improve the sustainability of the society and the well-being of the people.

The most recent supercontinent, Pangea, coalesced about 300 million years ago, whereas older supercontinents are hypothesized to have formed around 600 million years ago (Pannotia), 1000 million years ago (Rodinia), and 1800 million years ago (Columbia/Nuna).  Supercontinents have a coincident relationship to some important developments in Earth history including the formation of economic mineral deposits (Columbia), severe climatic fluctuations (Rodinia) and the evolution of modern animal phyla (Pannotia).  Because modern continents hold the dispersed remnants of ancient crust, determining the timing of supercontinent assembly requires paleomagnetic and geochronologic knowledge of the entire globe.   Peninsular India is a fusion of five ancient pieces of continental crust known as the Aravalli, Bundelkhand, Singhbhum, Dharwar, and Bastar cratons.  The research in this proposal is focused on determining the paleogeographic assembly of the five cratonic pieces by an investigation into the magnetic directions in igneous rocks.  The diverse research team, including undergraduate students, graduate students and foreign collaborators, targets three key regions in the Dharwar, Bundelkhand and Singhbhum cratons.  The paleomagnetic data being gathered in this investigation is incorporated into global paleogeographic models that are key to understanding larger scale questions such as: When were all continents assembled into larger supercontinents?, How has the Earth's magnetic field changed through time?, and What were ancient climatic conditions and how might they help us understand future climates?.  Important societal impacts from this study include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in an important STEM discipline, educational outreach activities and collaboration with a 2-year community college, K-12 classroom outreach including predominantly African-American and Hispanic middle schools, and efforts that involve mentorship of university STEM students from underrepresented groups. The project also involves international scientific collaboration with scientists from India.<br/><br/>The investigators outline a series of goals aimed to clarify the geological history of Peninsular India and interpret global tectonic implications.  The work conducted in this proposal is generating that 1) refine the sequence of events that led to India's assembly, and 2) also elucidate India's place in the proposed supercontinents of Columbia/Nuna and Rodinia.  In a review of global tectonic models, it is noted that Peninsular India is treated as a unified block during the entire Proterozoic, but available paleomagnetic and geochronologic data do not support such a conclusion. Additionally, structural and geochronological data from the Central Indian Tectonic Zone suggest that unity was not achieved until ~1100-900 Ma.  Comparing a robust paleomagnetic record from India with results from around the globe will establish the tempo and mode of plate tectonics in the Proterozoic, helping answer the question of when modern style tectonics began.  In reviewing ""traditional"" models of Rodinia and Columbia, it is apparent that the central structure of the supercontinents appears to show little change.  If the Rodinia configuration represents only a slight variation on Columbia/Nuna, this might reflect some underlying difference from modern-style (Phanerozoic) plate tectonics, or perhaps fundamental mode of plate organization regularity throughout geologic time.   These data allow the researchers to evaluate potential ""nearest neighbors"" to the Indian cratons such as North China, East Antarctica, Australia, Baltica, and parts of Africa and Madagascar.	The contributions add an important component to studies of ancient climatic gradients across the Earth, behavior and strength of the magnetic field, the record of true polar wander, and the identification of large igneous provinces in formerly adjacent cratons that may host important metallogenic ore deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In alignment with these goals, the Leech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) project named ""Online, Outside, and in the Community: Making the Case for Science Education Relevance in Native American Communities"" provides a coherent suite of activities that enhance the college's STEM degree program. While the degree was developed to equip current and future generations of American Indian students with the skills necessary to enter a competitive and rapidly evolving STEM workforce, community surveys indicate a disconnect between these careers and the perceived importance and accessibility of STEM education within the community. To address this disconnect, the LLTC project builds the college's capacity to provide relevant, high quality STEM instruction and improved accessibility to STEM education within the Leech Lake communities. The project's activities focus on four main areas: outreach, expanding distance education offerings, improving access to technology, and student recruitment and retention. The multiple components are designed to improve STEM outcomes for Native students including increasing Native representation in the STEM workforce, thereby decreasing economic disparities within the Leech Lake community.<br/><br/>With their ongoing commitment to produce graduates prepared to answer the local and regional workforce demands, LLTC is extending beyond its traditional local student base to provide accessible STEM education through community service-oriented outreach and distance education development. The project utilizes an array of complementary activities including 1) the provision of wifi hotspots around the reservation community, computer skills training, and a computer loan program to increase Internet access for students; 2) the development of additional online STEM courses; 3) the modification of developmental math courses using Backward Design; 4) a series of culturally relevant STEM outreach activities in area high schools; 5) professional development training for their faculty on distance education instructional techniques; 6) the formation of a cohort structure for STEM students; and 7) the development of a formal recruitment strategy aimed at local secondary students. The strengthening of LLTC's educational capacity will result in long-term benefits for the both the college and the community including greater STEM enrollment, increased community engagement with LLTC STEM, higher numbers of Native graduates entering the local STEM workforce, and improved economic stability for Native people and their community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much attention has been given to how this will affect shelled animals like corals, but acidification also affects the algae that form the base of the ocean food chain. It is possible that future algal communities will look very different than they do today, with potentially negative consequences for fisheries, recreation, and climate. Alternatively, it is possible that these algae will be able to adapt rapidly enough to avoid the worst of it.  This study looks at algae adapting to acidification in real time in the lab, focusing on ""marketplace"" interactions between the algae and the bacteria they live alongside. The researchers also go to sea to learn whether adaptations from the lab experiments are beneficial under real-world conditions. Ultimately, this project is helping scientists better understand how the ocean's most important and most overlooked organisms will respond to the changes humans are causing in their habitat. The researchers also use their scientific work to create fun educational opportunities from grade school to college, including agar art classes where students learn about microbial ecology by ""painting"" with freshly-isolated ocean bacteria.<br/><br/>The effect of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms has been well-studied, but less is known about how changing pH will affect phytoplankton. Previous work showed that the mutualistic interaction between the globally abundant cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and its ""helper"" bacterium Alteromonas broke down under projected future CO2 conditions, leading to a strong decrease in the fitness of Prochlorococcus. It is possible that such interspecies interactions between microbes are important for many ecological processes, but a lack of understanding of how these interactions evolve makes it difficult to predict how important they are. This project is using laboratory evolution experiments to discover how evolution shapes the interactions between bacteria and algae like Prochlorococcus, and how these co-evolutionary dynamics might influence the biogeochemical processes that shape Earth's climate. Four research cruises to the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series are also planned to study how natural algal/bacterial communities respond to acidification, and whether evolved microbes from laboratory experiments have a competitive advantage in complex, natural communities exposed to elevated CO2.

One of the reasons for this variable success is prior linguistic experience from different L1s. Moreover, the presence of multilingualism, that many adults will learn several languages over their lifetime, makes it harder to assess prior knowledge. Learning a language means becoming attuned to and developing expectations for systematic linguistic patterns, from sound sequences to grammatical relations. Successfully learning a novel language requires that adults abstract new systematic patterns from the input while using existing ones from their learned language(s). This research will help us understand language prediction and multilingual learning processes.<br/><br/>This dissertation research project employs an artificial grammar learning paradigm to investigate how a particular kind of probabilistic systematic pattern, predictive dependencies, in adults' existing tense-aspect system(s) can promote or prevent adaptation to novel tense-aspect regularities. Adult participants from two L1 backgrounds, English and Thai, will learn a miniature language that expresses temporal meaning involving both English- and Thai-analogous predictive dependencies at different levels: between lexical and sub-lexical items (e.g., walk+ed) for English and between lexical items (e.g., a pair of aspect markers such as sed leew [""already completed""]) for Thai. Because the same meaning in the miniature language is equally likely to appear with both sets of dependencies, this research will investigate (1) whether participants are better able to learn predictive dependencies that are consistent with their L1-analogous dependencies and (2) whether the findings will be true under bilingual learning conditions for the English participants, who have perfect knowledge of one set of dependencies and zero knowledge of the other, and under trilingual learning conditions for the Thai-English participants, who have both sets of dependencies available for use during learning but with varying degrees of statistical precision in their L2, English.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will explore the materials science and physics of electrical contacts to solar cells. In so doing, it will advance the understanding of how these contacts limit the operation of the cells. Every solar cell must perform two processes: convert light into excited electrons and extract those electrons in the form of current. The former process is performed by a semiconductor absorber material; the latter by two electrical contacts between which the absorber is sandwiched. Although solar cells are mass manufactured and now generate 1% of the electricity consumed in the U.S., there are still fundamental questions that are unanswered. The research community does not yet understand which properties determine if a material will make an excellent electrical contact and how to quickly find and make materials with the desired properties. This project will provide answers to these questions with a combination of measurements and simulations applied to existing model systems, as well as experiments to use the resulting understanding to develop new contacts. Success in the project will lay the groundwork for solar cells that are 10-15% more efficient than today's cells, reducing the cost of solar electricity generation to below 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This, in turn, is predicted to accelerate the deployment of solar energy, resulting in 17% of U.S. electricity being generated by solar in 2030 instead of the 5% projected in a business-as-usual scenario. In addition to these scientific, environmental, and societal impacts, this project will also train community college, undergraduate, and graduate students for the 260,000 solar jobs presently in the US through a week-long, hands-on ""Solar Cell 101"" course in which they make cells and modules from start to finish.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>Many photovoltaic (PV) technologies have arrived at absorber materials that have low non-radiative recombination rates and thus could support cell voltages approaching the detailed-balance limit, but no technology has developed comparatively ideal electrical contacts that are transparent, that passivate the absorber surface, and that selectively extract electrons or holes from the absorber. This project targets key questions that inhibit rapid progress in heterojunction contact understanding and technology using (1) a characterization suite that links together the properties of carrier-selective layers, contacts containing those layers, and PV cells containing those contacts, and (2) a new deposition technique using dry-cluster spraying to enable intimate control of the stoichiometry of contact layers without sputter damage. These two platforms will be applied to crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride PV cells as model systems, as these technologies have readily available high-quality absorbers (which makes interpretation of the function of the contacts more apparent), a collection of previously developed contacts for these materials is available for analysis but ideal contacts have yet to be discovered, and any advances in understanding and technology resulting from the project will have large research and commercial impact. After studying the underlying physics of state-of-the-art existing contacts, the project will progress to depositing and testing heretofore unexplored carrier-selective layers, including wide-bandgap, heavily doped, amorphous or polycrystalline III-V materials. This research will address the critical impediment--excellent contacts--to 27%-efficient silicon PV cells and 25%-efficient cadmium telluride cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such ""yield-stress materials"" have a wide variety of uses. These include petrochemical, photovoltaic, pharmaceutical, food, and 3D printing applications. These applications share the need for a material which can retain a desired shape under certain conditions but can be made to flow on demand. Ideally, one would design the characteristics of such materials to match the specific requirements of the relevant process. However, there is no accurate way of determining the precise conditions under which these materials yield. This research will develop experimental methods that link the mechanical changes we observe on human length scales to what happens at a molecular level.  This will enable the design of new materials as well as more efficient industrial processes. The integrated education and outreach component of this project supports broader outreach to school-age children, along with graduate and undergraduate research training and mentorship. Outreach efforts consist of programs designed to teach budding scientists about the complexity of soft matter research through programs that target underrepresented groups. Outreach through these programs, and with Campus Middle School for girls will introduce young students to the concepts of soft matter and 3D printing.  Undergraduate classes will be enhanced by incorporation of higher-level material obtained through this work.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This CAREER award will develop the tools and fundamental science needed to understand and predict the time-dependent structural and rheological transitions observed in thixotropic yield stress fluids. Hybrid experiments in which rheological information is paired with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering and X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy provide ideal tools to simultaneously access the necessary range of length scale features (nm - micron) and time scales (ms - hours). The hierarchical structural complexity of concentrated colloidal suspensions known to be thixotropic yield stress fluids poses a challenge due to a wide physical parameter space. Processing flows that take the materials far from equilibrium expand this parameter space further. We will establish a rheo-scattering-based methodology to guide measurements and ultimately design of structural and rheological dynamics. Transient molecular-level structural dynamics obtained from two-time correlations from rheo-XPCS will be paired and compared with novel transient rheological analysis methods pioneered by the PI. The PI will develop new structure-property-processing relationships to capture the complexity of destruction and restructuring under applied deformation. The researchers will design, develop, and implement rheological protocols that tease out information regarding the transient recoverable elastic strain in thixotropic materials. Prior work from the PI has developed rheological analysis tools for out-of-equilibrium processing that are perfectly suited to determining the transient rheological nature of thixotropic materials. This program will build on the established equivalence between yielding and thixotropy, shedding light on the underlying physical causes of yielding and restructuring under flow, expediting their controlled design in real systems by combining rheological characterization, microscopic structural probes, and model development. Each of these aspects will address fundamental topics (the rheology of yielding and restructuring, thixotropy as anti-yielding, new models) in a mutually beneficial, synergistic fashion that provides a unique and rational approach to materials discovery and design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early work emphasized the importance of geographic isolation to limit gene flow among populations. Without gene flow, populations might then evolve into new species over long periods of time. More recent work has focused on the role of natural selection in accelerating the evolution of species, with or without gene flow among populations. This project tests a new idea, that the rapid evolution of new allosomes can accelerate the rate of speciation in some lineages. The researchers will focus on the exceptionally diverse lineage of cichlid fishes found in tropical areas around the world. More than 2,000 species of cichlid fishes are known, making them the most rapidly speciating lineage of extant vertebrates. Recent work has revealed unexpected diversity in the allosomes of these fishes. This diversity may be due to a unique behavior in which females mouthbrood eggs and larvae for periods of up to three weeks. The associated differences in behavior and physiology between males and females causes different genetic changes to be favored in males and females. This pattern is known as genetic conflict. This project will test the hypothesis that these genetic conflicts are responsible for the rapid evolution of new allosomes. In turn, this rapid evolution is thought to be important in the rapid rate of speciation in this group. The project will promote scientific exchange between the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil.  It will also provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students at University of Maryland. <br/><br/>The researchers will use genomic techniques to characterize allosomes in cichlid fishes from Africa and South America. Regions of genetic differentiation between males and females will be identified using whole-genome DNA sequencing. Long-read sequencing technology will be used to characterize changes in the sequence and structure of chromosomes during the early stages of allosome evolution. Comparative phylogenetic analysis will be used to determine whether high rates of allosome turnover are associated with life history traits. The specific focal trait is female mouthbrooding, which correlates with antagonistic selection between males and females. To determine whether evolutionary changes in allosomes create genetic incompatibilities the researchers will measure the fitness of hybrids between species with different allosomes. These data will allow theoretical predictions about the mechanisms of allosome evolution to be tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well known that cells within organisms respond to stimuli, such as light, gravity, hormones or any number of environmental triggers; however, when and how cells respond remains a mystery in part because it is technologically challenging to identify which cells are responding. Often responsive cells are not easily distinguished from non-responsive cells. In this high-risk, high reward project, the research team solves this problem by developing a molecular tool to identify and capture when and where cells respond to a stimulus, such as a hormone signal, in plant roots. The method will be broadly useful to detect other responses, and in many different plants and plant organs, due to its universal and modular design. The new technology will allow scientists to test new environments or treatments and identify how plant cells respond rapidly and precisely. The outcomes will impact researchers' ability to understand growth responses of diverse plants ranging from crops to model systems. Undergraduate students will have in-depth research training by contributing to the project during a summer research intensive. <br/><br/><br/>Recent advances in molecular profiling of specific plant cell types have generated important breakthroughs in understanding cell differentiation and cell type-specific stress responses. The research team has played a key role in this through the development and application of our INTACT (Isolation of Nuclei TAgged specific Cell Types) and TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) and TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) methods in crop plants. Despite the utility of INTACT and TRAP, there remains a pressing need to be able to capture the subsets of cells of a given cell type as they respond to a stimulus. Cells undergoing a response to such a stimulus are a subset of a population and cannot be easily captured by available methods. This limited resolution hinders the ability to address the molecular details of plant-microbe interactions, responses to hormone signaling, and spatially non-uniform abiotic stresses. The research team will address this problem by developing a system for selective purification of nuclei and translating ribosomes from cell subpopulations that are actively undergoing a specific response, such as drought sensing or interaction with a microbe. This will be achieved by producing two-component INTACT and TRAP systems in which one component (the biotinylatable nuclear envelope- or ribosomal-tagging protein) is expressed from a cell type-specific promoter, while Biotin ligase is driven from a stimulus-inducible promoter. In this way, the entire population of a cell type can be analyzed by purification of organelles using anti-GFP beads, while the subset of responsive cells can be analyzed by Streptavidin bead purification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in the decades since most water infrastructure was constructed in the western U.S., the burned area, frequency, and severity of wildfires has increased considerably. While wildfires can have short-term impacts on the quantity and quality of water supply, the erosion that occurs after severe burns can also deliver significant amounts of sediment to rivers and downstream reservoirs, reducing the long-term storage capacity of water supplies. Further, with projected future increases in wildfire, there will be increases in river sediment. Thus, in this project the researchers will develop new computer-based modeling tools capable of identifying and quantifying the risk that post-wildfire erosion poses to downstream water infrastructure. The first application of this modeling framework will be the water supply reservoirs throughout Utah, one of the driest states in the U.S., where the vulnerability of each reservoir will be quantified as to the erosion and sedimentation risk posed by wildfire. Similar to dammed reservoirs across the nation, sedimentation in Utah reservoirs is a growing concern for aging water infrastructure, even before accounting for the projected increases in future wildfire. Finally, the researchers will integrate their model into online, open-source programs, making these resources available to any person or agency interested in applying the model to other states or regions. The deliverables of this project will provide critical information and tools for improved and more targeted forest management, help identify and protect vulnerable water resources, and address crucial knowledge gaps for predicting downstream impacts from post-wildfire erosion. Collaborating across two universities, this project will provide support for one post-doctoral researcher (PI Murphy), two PhD students, and a minimum of six undergraduate students to train and develop their skills in hydrology, geomorphology, data analysis and management, and science communication. <br/><br/>This project will advance fundamental knowledge critical for predicting the locations and timing of post-wildfire sediment delivery to downstream water infrastructure. The researchers will link new and existing models that: 1) predict the locations and magnitudes of post-wildfire erosion, 2) route post-wildfire sediment inputs downstream through river networks in a physics-based and hydro-geomorphically sensitive manner, and 3) determine a range of potential volumetric sediment inputs to downstream reservoirs under a range of wildfire conditions. Applying this new modeling framework to the 133 major reservoirs throughout Utah, this project will answer four key research questions: 1) Which water supply reservoirs in Utah are most vulnerable to post-wildfire erosion? 2) What is the time lag between occurrence of a wildfire and loss of reservoir storage downstream? 3) Which landscape, fire, hydrologic, and vegetation characteristics exert the strongest control on the upstream storage vs. delivery of post-fire sediment to reservoirs? 4) What landscape, fire and river network attributes control the relative increase in post-wildfire sediment yields above background yields? Through this analysis, the researchers will specifically assess the influence of sediment connectivity on reservoir vulnerability, as well as the contribution of coarse sediment inputs to the reductions in reservoir storage over longer transport timescales. Given the complex ownership and management of dams, they will engage a stakeholder advisory group that spans the diverse range of ownership and includes public utilities departments, state and federal forest management agencies, and dam operators. Further, they will work with the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) to integrate their models into open-source platforms, and create a public platform to host the project datasets, educational materials, technical reports, and publications. This project represents research at the frontier of integrated geosciences, and this new modeling framework fills a critical gap regarding the tools needed to assess urgent societal concerns regarding wildfire and water security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The circulation of seawater through deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems results in the extensive transformation of both inorganic and organic carbon compounds and may have a significant impact on the deep ocean carbon cycle. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on methane and light hydrocarbons. The distribution and abundance of other types of organic compounds, however, remains poorly known. As a result, the contribution of hydrothermal systems to organic carbon in the deep ocean and the biogeochemical processes responsible for this input, remain highly uncertain. This research conducts a comprehensive study of the composition and abundance of carbon compounds from fluids discharging from two very different, but closely located, hydrothermal vents on the ultraslow spreading mid-Cayman rise in the Caribbean Sea. The two vent sites are located in substantially different host rocks and occur at very different water depths. They also have very different vent fluid temperatures.  Fluids will be collected using multiple, complementary sampling systems and analyzed by various mass spectrometric and other analytical techniques. Comparison between these two sites allows carbon fluxes and chemical transformations to be determined over a range of physical and chemical conditions. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art geochemical methods and provide them with an opportunity to gain experience and training in sea-going research in a strongly interdisciplinary subject. A graduate and several undergraduate students from the University of South Carolina, an EPSCoR state (i.e., a state that does not receive significant federal dollars); Bridgewater State University, which serves economically disadvantaged communities in Massachusetts; and the University of Colorado at Boulder will be involved in the research and play key roles in both the scientific cruise and supporting laboratory activities.<br/><br/>In ocean crust, extensive transformations occur to the carbon compounds present in both the fluids and solids on and below the seafloor due to processes such as heating, precipitation of minerals, injections of magma, and the activity of microorganisms. These processes have consequences for global elemental cycling in the present day and over geologic time. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on small, volatile organic molecules such as methane. However, the abundance and fate of other types of organic compounds remains poorly known. To better understand these transformations and the amount of carbon in seafloor hydrothermal systems and their potential impact on deep sea microbes and ecology, samples of hydrothermal fluids emanating from two compositionally and thermally different seafloor vent systems on the mid-Cayman rise (Piccard and von Damm) will be collected on a 16-day oceanographic cruise using a robotic vehicle. Samples will be analyzed for their carbon content and carbon compounds using mass spectrometric and other analytical tools. Goals of the project are to addresses issues such as: (1) the relative contribution of abiotic synthesis, thermal alteration of biomass, fluid-rock interaction, and microbial activity to the inventory of carbon compounds in ridge-crest hydrothermal fluids, (2) how host rock, style of venting, and temperature influence the generation and stability of reduced carbon compounds in axial hot-springs, (3) the fate of seawater-derived dissolved organic carbon during circulation through the oceanic lithosphere, and (4) which organic compounds and signatures are the best geochemical indicators of fluid reaction history. Three different sampling devices will be employed to ensure the full range of carbon containing compounds is captured. Collected samples will be analyzed for bulk characteristics (dissolved organic carbon concentrations and isotopes) and for the composition and isotope characteristics of individual compounds, ranging from volatile (e.g. methane and light hydrocarbons) to non-volatile (e.g. fatty acids), and from labile (e.g. amino acids) to refractory (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). These data will permit the calculation of carbon and isotope mass balances at each location. From this, a comparison of the fate of carbon in both systems will be carried out to evaluate the importance of rock type, temperature, and style of venting on the carbon-bearing compounds present in seafloor hydrothermal vents. Additional measurements will be made with non-targeted, broad spectrum organic compound analyses to identify alteration trends and carbon compound evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Power electronics play critical roles in renewable energy integration, computing and telecommunication, grid-scale energy storage, and transportation electrification, all at the edge of the future smart grid. These emerging energy systems are usually modular and granular. This research project targets a generalized design method that will enable a new family of power electronics that can achieve high performance and perform new functions at the grid edge for a variety of applications. ``Granular power electronics'' represents a systematic design approach that pushes the intelligence and capability of power electronics to a granular level that has not been demonstrated before. The PI will leverage the recent advances in wide-band-gap devices, circuit architectures, and control methodologies to address the challenges of controlling sophisticated power flow, modeling magnetics with granular structures, and addressing the inverter-to-inverter oscillation problem in nano-grids with many smart inverters. The results of this project will be incorporated into the efforts that the PI is currently leading as a part of the ""Campus-as-a-Lab"" program to create research opportunities for undergraduate students. The outreach program for K-12 students, involving them in the development of experimental demos, will expose them to the role of power electronics in improving the quality and sustainability of our daily lives and attract them to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The PI will perform a systematic investigation on the fundamental principles of granular and modular power electronics. The PI will (1) develop design toolkits (modules, schematics, and layout patterns) comprising switched-inductor cells, switched-capacitor cells, bridge structures, and magnetic-couplers which may serve as the basis of granular power conversion architectures, (2) establish systematic methods to evaluate the topology, select the components, control the power flow, model the magnetics, estimate the grid impedance, and perform stability analysis of granular power electronics and systems with sophisticated power flow; (3) develop open-source computer-aided-design tools for the design and control of granular power conversion architectures; and (4) build small-scale experimental systems to verify the developed methods and benefit education. The PI will use three emerging and important energy systems at the grid edge as examples - smart inverters (distributed energy generation), large scale energy systems (data center power delivery), and a nano-grid test platform for multidisciplinary energy systems research. High performance grid-interface power electronics topologies will be studied, and model-based multi-agent control strategies will be developed to enable a future smart grid with many granular power electronics at the edge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although new sources of fossil fuels are being found and cleaner extraction techniques are being developed, alternatives to fossil fuels are needed that produce fewer greenhouse gases. The overarching goal of the REU's research projects is to advance knowledge and understanding of alternative technologies while reducing dependence on fossil fuels for the production of energy, fuel, clean water, and/or materials. This REU supports the education of students from institutions with few research opportunities, particularly for under-represented groups and first-generation college students. Students will be actively recruited from 2- and 4-year regional institutions in the EPSCOR states Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, as well as through the national networks of the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and American Indian Science and Engineering Society chapters. The students will be mentored throughout their summer research to encourage them to continue their studies in graduate work, with a goal of broadening their representation in academic research.<br/><br/>The Solar and Alternative Technologies Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site will involve undergraduate students in summer research projects for 10 weeks developing fuel, catalysts, power, clean water, and plastics from renewable sources or using renewable energy. The projects include water desalination and the production of microalgal biofuel, biocatalysts, and nanoellipsoids. More than half of the projects focus on solar energy, ranging from a new way to produce silicon, to the effects of fluid flow patterns on energy production, to the matching of energy resources and needs to create a micro-grid for local energy needs. The undergraduate students will learn about responsible conduct of research, environmental ethics, technical communication through journal articles and oral presentations, and posting about research on social media. Students will give two progress presentations and a final oral report and prepare a final written formal report, similar to a journal article. Tours will include local hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, and waste-to-energy facilities.

As the same organ mediates these two, mutually exclusive behaviors, understanding how females decide when and where to perform each behavior is critical for animal fertility and survival. Work in numerous systems has shown that mating and reproductive behaviors are controlled by diverse chemical signals that shape activity in neural circuits, but the function of physical contact and mechanosensory feedback is less explored. The goal of this research and education program is to identify how such mechanosensory signals regulate reproduction using the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model organism. The principal investigator and his student trainees have shown using cutting-edge imaging techniques that defined cells of the C. elegans female reproductive neural circuit are mechanically activated in sequence during specific steps of mating and egg-laying behaviors. The goal of this project is to determine how each of these cells is mechanically activated and how they signal to drive subsequent behavior steps. The rationale for this work is that understanding the regulation of key signaling events in simple neural circuits will reveal conserved mechanisms in other animals and people. This work will be paired with a new, innovative education program that teaches molecular genetic laboratory techniques through the development of new tools to regulate gene expression and through authentic research projects to study how animals respond to acute changes in pressure and stretch.<br/><br/>This work will identify how mechanosensory feedback modulates cellular signaling events to regulate animal reproductive behaviors. This project will use the roundworm, C. elegans, to test a model that mating and reproductive behaviors proceed via an ordered series of sequential motor steps regulated by three different types of mechanosensory feedback. This feedback activates unique cells which signal through distinct neurotransmitters and receptors to inhibit the prior motor step while activating the next. Objective 1 will determine how the female uv1 neuroendocrine cells are mechanically activated in response to male mating spicule insertion and during egg release. Objective 2 will determine whether the female VC motor neurons are mechanically activated in response to male sperm transfer through the vulva and by muscle contractile activity during vulval opening. Objective 3 will uncover how mechanical stretch of the uterus in response to sperm deposition or egg accumulation re-activates the vulval muscles to terminate mating or to initiate egg release. In each case, the experiments will identify the mechanosensory molecules that mediate cell activation and will determine how the activated cells signal to report the completion of each behavior step. The research is integrated with a new authentic research Molecular Genetics laboratory course where undergraduate students will develop and characterize new Gal4/UAS enhancer trap lines that will facilitate gene and behavior discovery. Together, this work will provide the most detailed model yet for how mechanosensory feedback shapes activity and neurotransmitter signaling in a neural circuit as it executes two mutually exclusive behavior states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include oil spill mitigation, air entrained in bow waves in ships and submarines, and ocean-atmosphere interactions associated with breaking waves.  The bubble interface may deform and break violently under the action of turbulent flows, and the newly formed interfaces dramatically increase transfer of heat and mass between the gas and liquid phases.  This award describes a series of state-of-the-art numerical and experimental studies of the fragmentation of bubbles in turbulent flow. The goal is to produce a general model that describes the roles of turbulent flow and the interface properties on the rupture of bubbles.  This will result in a major step forward and a valuable tool in designing engineering solutions and ocean and climate modeling.  The award will also support educational activities for elementary school students, undergraduates, and graduate students.  Software developed through this work will be open source and widely available to the public and other researchers interested in modeling multiphase flows.<br/><br/><br/>This work will develop an understanding of the multi-scale nature of bubble break-up phenomena under realistic conditions in terms of turbulent flow and the physico-chemical complexity of the interfaces. The break-up of bubbles far from the critical break-up size exhibits dramatic behavior, with the formation of multiple tiny satellite bubbles. The presence of surfactants at the bubble interface, ubiquitous in nature and industry, lowers the interfacial tension and affects the break-up processes.  However, this latter aspect remains largely unexplored. Systematic experiments and direct numerical simulations for various turbulence configurations will probe these multi-scale regimes. The researchers will also characterize experimentally the role of the physico-chemical properties of the interface by working with controlled surfactant and salinity conditions. In the absence of surfactant, researchers will determine how the break-up dynamics and child bubble statistics are controlled by the ratio between the bubble size and the turbulent Taylor microscale, which controls the excitation range scale, and the ratio between the bubble size and the critical Hinze scale, which controls the break-up mode and the local or non-local range of child bubble size production. In the presence of surfactants, researchers will characterize the filamentary structures that arise due to the extended stability of interfaces, leading to the generation of much smaller bubble fragments. From these extensive data sets, a mathematical framework that can be implemented in multi-phase simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations will be developed. This will allow the modeling of fragmentation in turbulent flow with complex surface rheology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As these types of disturbances become more frequent, the interactions between them can greatly amplify the impacts on forest health and sustainability. This project will study an unprecedented, ongoing forest mortality event that affects oak-dominated forests in southern New England. Tree mortaility appears to be related to the interaction of both drought and multiple canopy defoliations by non-native Gypsy Moth caterpillars. This project will evaluate how the timing and interactions of those disturbances matters in forest health. The research will assess if areas that have greater tree mortality are those that experienced the most intense initial drought or if they underwent defoliation closer in time to the drought. The results of the project will be very valuable to forest stakeholders, helping them understand the underlying causes of the tree mortality event and potentially allowing prediction of future impacts. The investigators are highly engaged with the regional forest management community and the results of the project will be used in planning forest management strategies including tree removals related to this mortality event. The project is important as it will communicate the potential ramifications for wood products markets, forestry and arboriculture practices, and general forest use by the public. <br/><br/>Interactions between climate-mediated disturbances, such as droughts, and biotic disturbances, such as defoliating insect pests, are increasingly driving continental-scale forest structure and function. However, the temporal lags associated with drought effects on biotic disturbance are not well understood and empirical data to address this topic are lacking. The central hypothesis of this project is that the effect of interacting drought and defoliation disturbance will be mediated by temporal proximity between disturbances and initial drought severity. The project will combine high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing analysis with dendrochronological reconstruction of forest growth patterns to assess how the timing and severity of interacting disturbances affects patterns of disturbance resistance, forest productivity, and tree mortality in temperate forest ecosystems. The study will be conducted in a network of forest stands, identified through the remote sensing analysis, which will be replicated across categories of defoliation timing in relation to the initial drought disturbance. The results of the project will support hypothesis generation, model parameterization, and general conceptual frameworks for future experimental and modeling studies that can evaluate the mechanistic basis for, and consequences of, disturbance interactions in terrestrial ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.<br/><br/>For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of New Jersey.  The eight public and private institutions that make up the GSLSAMP are diverse and include one community college and seven four-year institutions, including one private institution.  The institutions are Essex County College, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Kean University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University New Brunswick and Newark, and William Paterson University.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 60% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by integrating GSLSAMP efforts and proven best practices into institutional, local and regional efforts that encourage success in STEM including learning communities, research experiences, academic bootcamps, collaboration with the community colleges of the Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate, research conferences and advisement. It will also increase the number of urban minority students from GSLSAMP institutions pursuing graduate education and international experiences by 20% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to ""cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.""<br/><br/>The knowledge generating research study seeks to understand the factors and mechanisms related to the GSLSAMP's successes in increasing the participation of URM students in STEM from several common and uncommon sources and their subsequent graduation with an undergraduate STEM degree.  The studies will potentially reveal the factors and mechanisms in the STEM academic pipeline that increase URM students' interests and efforts in pursuing graduate training and a career in STEM, which will lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These features will require an optimal and distributed coordination of a cluster of buildings, distributed energy resources, and a smart grid, while considering human behavior and mobility. The development and engagement of smart meters and social media have opened a new paradigm for community energy planning and underscore the need for a holistic engineering framework to model a new energy infrastructure of a community. This project aims to bridge this gap between smart building technologies, social interactions, energy trading and grid operation through an integrated research and education program.<br/><br/>In the project, an approach will be developed that advances current state-of-the-art community energy planning and management technology through use of large-scale heterogeneous data sets, including smart meter, occupant behavior and social media data, an urban scale energy and behavior co-simulation platform, and an advanced integrated building, grid and distributed energy resources control framework. The research aims to will bridge the gap between data science and smart building technologies. To address the challenges involved, the following research tasks will be pursued: (1) Develop a new mathematical framework to learn community connections. Occupant behavior from heterogeneous data sets will be learned, classifies and clustered. A new Markov modeling of occupant movement and presence will be developed; (2) Develop an innovative co-simulation platform to integrate a new occupant behavior model with community level energy modeling. A new spatiotemporal occupant model linking presence and behavior will be developed, and physical models of community urban energy infrastructure will be integrated and coupled with a new behavior model; and (3) Develop a hierarchical control framework to evaluate and quantify energy savings from individual buildings to a whole community based on community connections and an integrated co-simulation platform. A multilayer model with predictive control architecture will be designed to address the time-discrepancy issuesof various energy systems. This approach sets it sights on a systematic understanding of how a set of diverse occupant behavior impacts operation decisions and energy efficiency as a whole in a future smart city. If successful, the approach may transform current sustainable community design and operation to actively involve macro-level occupant behavior and human mobility modeling. The PI will work with existing minority engineering programs, student organizations, and honors programs at UTSA designed to recruit and graduate minority students, such as the NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), the Ronald McNair Scholars programs, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. The principal investigator will also maintain a website to make the research results and online games available to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2018, the eruption of Kilauea captured the attention of the world as lava poured over vast areas of the Big Island of Hawaii and created brand new, barren land as it cooled. The first organisms to colonize new habitats are often able to disperse long distances and breed quickly. However, the first organism to colonize after a lava flow in Hawaii is the poorly studied lava cricket, Caconemobius fori. This cricket is an unlikely first colonist for several reasons. First, these crickets don't have wings, which means that they cannot fly to travel long distances but instead walk. This also means that they cannot sing to find mates like most other cricket species. Second, little is known about the mating behavior of the lava cricket, but in its close relatives, the female chews on the leg of the male and consumes his blood. In a hot, dry environment like a lava field, this loss of fluid could be very costly for males. The recent eruption of the Kilauea volcano provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the potentially unusual behaviors of these crickets, and how, or if, they overcome these challenges to succeed as first colonists. The investigators will conduct behavioral studies to understand how the crickets find each other despite not being able to sing, and will characterize the mating behaviors and reproductive success of the crickets.  Investigators will interact with visitors and personnel at Volcanoes National Park, develop materials for the visitors center at the park, and develop a short film about the focal species to share findings about this unique species with the general public.  <br/><br/>Volcanic eruptions are dramatic and environmentally devastating.  The 2018 eruption of Kilauea on the Island of Hawaii covered almost 14 square miles of land and left continuous areas of barren lava in its wake. Despite the desolation of the habitat, it is colonized within several months following lava cooling. Surprisingly, the first multicellular colonist of lava flows in Hawaii is not a plant or generalist invertebrate, but is the cricket, Caconemobius forii, a potentially highly specialized species. Generally, first colonizers of new habitat are thought to be 'weedy' species capable of dispersing long distances and breeding profusely. Yet the lava cricket, C. fori, challenges these assumptions. These crickets lack wings, rendering them dispersal limited and unable to call to locate mates like most other cricket species. Furthermore, closely related species show high levels of mating failure and male investment - while mating, females chew on the tibial spur of males and drink the hemolymph. Given the extreme heat and dry condition of lava flows, this should be very costly for males. The aims of this study are to (1) conduct field surveys to clarify C. fori habitat use of lava flows of different ages; (2) test whether C. fori uses olfactory cues for mate localization, and (3) characterize their reproductive behavior and success. The results of this study will provide insight to the characteristics of first colonists, and advance our understanding of animal communication and reproduction in extreme environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many undergraduates attend institutions that do not afford them the opportunity to participate in research. This project establishes a Research Experience for Undergraduates at Occidental College in Los Angeles. The site will host nine undergraduates each summer, split into teams of three, to work on research problems in data science, game theory, and number theory. An emphasis will be placed on recruiting a diverse group of participants in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, as well as type of undergraduate institution being attended. In addition to the research conducted, the mentors will work with the students to improve their public speaking skills and their technical writing skills.  The mentors will conduct panels on ethics, graduate school, and career opportunities in mathematics. <br/><br/>The program offers a blend of computational investigation with theoretical pursuit of open research problems in data science, number theory and positional game theory. The problems to be investigated in this REU fit into the faculty's own research programs and are at the cutting edge of these fields. As such, the results will be of interest to others in the field and often lead to peer reviewed journal publications. The goal of the program is to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by having them take part in significant and interesting research projects. The participants will learn what it is like to be a professional mathematician. They will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from data science, number theory, and game theory and will work on important and often difficult problems that are suitable for undergraduate work. The faculty have a history of interest in working with undergraduates and success in choosing problems at an appropriate level for undergraduate work. The participants will be able to begin investigations almost immediately on computational aspects of the project, giving them an opportunity to spend the entire time at Occidental working on meaningful research. Students will produce reports summarizing their research for the summer; these reports will be posted on an REU website that is to be developed. Upon departing the REU, they will continue to work with their faculty mentors to produce journal publications when appropriate as well as to attend conferences to present their results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach is to explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies, where systems are rewarded when behaving correctly, for interacting physical systems when the systems with which they interact may react in inconsistent ways. The results are expected to contribute to a new self-learning intelligent control framework, where the systems under design can decide how to interact with their inconsistent neighbors in a way that will improve how they learn.  This will advance reinforcement learning for networked cyber-physical systems (CPS) which can have emergent behaviors when they interact (for example, unmanned aerial systems) and are frequently inconsistent due to uncertainties in their distributed nature (for example, the smart grid).<br/><br/>Three major fundamental contributions to the scientific field are expected. First, a new distributed RL algorithm will learn suitable reward functions automatically without requiring external supervisions. This work will relax human efforts and scale RL algorithms to more complex environment. Second, novel transfer learning-based RL architectures will be designed by reusing past knowledge from multiple sources. This design will further accelerate learning process in networked CPS. Third, this proposed method will be implemented on a multi-robot testbed to advance the learning in robot applications. Outreach and dissemination plans cultivate the scientific curiosity of K-12 students, and students from underrepresented groups, and motivate their interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs.

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ""black box"". This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. <br/><br/>This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies can now be conducted for realistic systems, as opposed to idealized models. In particular, it has become possible to describe very complex targets, such as transition metals and other open-shell systems. Examples include the excited states of the inert gases beyond helium, as well as neutral and lowly-ionized iron.  These systems are of significant importance for plasma diagnostics and astrophysics, respectively.  The source code will be made publicly available. The project will support a post-doctoral researcher. A website devoted to user-developer interaction will be developed and maintained together with the neccessary code documentation and training materials.<br/><br/>The numerical calculations will be based upon the non-perturbative R-matrix (close-coupling) method.  A particular strength of the implementation pursued in this project is the use of a highly flexible B-spline basis with non-orthogonal orbital sets.  The major advantage of the approach compared to traditional methods is the fact that an accurate target description can be achieved with a much-reduced configuration-interaction (CI) expansion if the orthogonality requirements on the individual orbitals are relaxed.  This is critical for complex targets, where the valence orbitals in particular are known to be strongly term-dependent. Using a sufficiently small but still accurate enough CI expansion for the target states is essential for the feasibility and quality of the subsequent collision calculation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urban development and agricultural expansion have resulted in the depletion of resources for many species, thus intensifying human-wildlife conflicts and increasing concerns of higher risks of disease infecting humans in proximity to wildlife. When a crisis emerges in an acute fashion (e.g., focusing event), there is an intensification of risk communicated in narrative form. This research measures changes in stakeholders risk narratives, information use, and policy preferences over space and time. To study the dynamic nature of risk narratives over space and time, this project examines a sudden human-wildlife conflict in northern Queensland, Australia, where unprecedented heat events have resulted in mass mortality of spectacled flying foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus). Inadequate state and local resources to deal with this record event have led to a crisis, whereby state and local concerns have flared over bat welfare, potential risks of disease being passed to humans (e.g., Lyssavirus), and illness from rotting bat corpses and maggot infestation. This crisis is a focusing event for flying fox management, whereby groups are mobilizing countervailing efforts: to list the spectacled flying fox as endangered and to remove flying fox habitat (e.g., large old fig trees) from urban areas. There is a coupled feature in this bat-human system that has created a new dynamic: the scale of the bat deaths coupled with a paralysis of governmental action leaving residents to take immediate action (i.e., round up and bag carcasses). The result of this new dynamic is an intensification of risk narratives as stakeholders make meaning of these events for flying foxes in high density urban communities. Given the immediate emergence of this crisis, this project seeks to understand urban-wildlife conflict through a temporal and spatial relationship between risk narratives and focusing events.   <br/><br/>To understand temporal and spatial effects on risk narratives, the research team conducts panel interviews and a panel survey. The present crisis event serves as T1 for baseline risk narrative data (i) to understand how stakeholders' risk narratives change (or remain stable) over time (T2 = 6 months and T3 = 12 months) as new information, policy decisions, and events emerge, and (ii) to capture the spatial variation of risk narratives as a function of distance from mass mortality roost sites. A longitudinal study of panel interviews of residents, wildlife carers, health care workers, and local council members in Cairns is conducted to analyze changes in narrative construct and sentiment. Panel interviews provide critical data to enable the researchers to probe for causal indicators of change in narrative construct and sentiment (e.g., new information, new exogenous shocks to the system). A longitudinal study using a panel survey of residents is conducted to analyze changes in narrative construct, risk perception, preferred solutions for flying fox management, and affect. These panel survey data measure changes in the response variables over time as well distance from the mortality event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The immediate impact of these events often grabs global attention and response due to the associated natural hazards. Recent advances in monitoring techniques, such as ground-based instrumentation and remotely sensed satellite data, has allowed quantification of the landscape, biogeochemical and hydrologic response to such events with unprecedented accuracy and precision. Such studies document the initial catastrophic consequences and ensuing process cascades. Modeling efforts have shed light on the potential long-term consequences of extreme perturbations, and suggest that in many cases these rare high-magnitude events are more important than slow and steady ""background"" processes when integrated over time. Scientific interest in improving understanding of extreme events on landscape dynamics on short to long timescales has grown in the past decade. However, despite recent progress, significant knowledge gaps exist, particularly with respect to the complex response to perturbations and potential feedbacks between various systems that operate in the Earth's near-surface environment. In addition to bringing together a wide range of scientists with the aim of identifying knowledge gaps and future research directions in the role of extreme events on earth surface dynamics, this conference will set forth guidelines for how to best approach such studies in the aftermath of an event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, at a time when worker organizations generally are on the decline, this sector has seen an increase. However, preliminary research suggests these new organizations are unlike those of the past. They appear to be focused on broad array of social programs for their membership while simultaneously loosening, or even severing, their ties to formal political parties. The research supported by this award will undertake an ethnographic and archival analysis of this new phenomenon. Findings from this research are important for rethinking the relationship between worker wellbeing and formal worker organizations. Findings will contribute to new theoretical understandings of the contemporary global economy and provide information useful for policy makers and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>This research will take place on the coast of Mexico, a tourism dependent region that has witnessed tremendous growth in worker organizations over the past two decades. The researcher will conduct a comparative institutional and archival analysis of two organizations, tracing political, economic, and social factors that produce their structures; relationships between the organizations and other social actors in the region; and their historical development. Data will be collected with a mix of ethnographic methods including participant observation in organizational headquarters and organization sponsored social programs; interviews with workers and leadership; discourse analysis; archival research; and focus groups. Findings from this research will provide insight into the social factors that promote and sustain worker organizations, the social and political effects this has on regions that rely on international tourism, and the significance of such organizations for workers lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the most pervasive PNT technology is Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, GNSS exhibits major vulnerabilities and limitations under certain conditions such as indoor navigation, malicious attacks like jamming or spoofing, and other GNSS-denied scenarios. This five-year career-development plan is a comprehensive research, education, and outreach program that will address GNSS limitations and form the next generation of PNT engineers. The combination of both elements will unlock the potential of secure and precise PNT using GNSS technology for indoor, as well as outdoor use. The objectives of the proposed research and education plan are: 1) to forge a novel, overarching signal processing paradigm to design advanced GNSS receivers. The PI will adopt direct-positioning to yield unprecedented ultra-high-sensitivity performance, enabling GNSS indoors; 2) to further reinforce of the theory of direct-positioning by incorporating security guarantees and mechanisms by using robust statistics; and 3) to implement an ambitious educational plan that includes multifaceted activities involving the use of the open source GNSS software-defined radio (GNSS-SDR) project. In turn, the GNSS-SDR will be deeply integrated with the research endeavors as a testbed, which naturally intertwines both research and education aspects of this project following the PI's ongoing efforts. The success of the proposed research will impact many applications where PNT is provided by GNSS, for which current limitations prevent faster adoption. This includes critical infrastructures, such as the power grid, first-responder squads, unmanned and autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, precision surveying, agriculture, or mass-market applications involving hand-held devices. <br/><br/>The project addresses a fundamental question in secure and ubiquitous PNT: what are the real limits of GNSS-denied scenarios. The research deepens around the direct-positioning paradigm, which is recognized by the GNSS community as a breakthrough in the design and understanding of GNSS technology. The main intuition is that synchronization parameters of all satellites are intimately related among them through the receiver position and velocity. The fact that all those signals are received at the same location and time instant is a strong constraint that is not exploited in current PNT schemes. In contrast, direct position estimation (DPE) jointly processes those signals, increasing its sensitivity and robustness to common propagation challenges such as weak signal, amplitude fading, multipath, jamming, spoofing, or ionospheric scintillation, therefore yielding to superior resilience in currently GNSS-denied environments. The research goals are structured in three thrusts: 1) to establish a DPE framework that allows for ultra-high-sensitivity receivers to operate in extreme environments, such as indoors. Tasks include derivation of the fundamental estimation bounds as well as investigation of the signal processing and sensor fusion methods that enable to efficiently attain those limits. The project will investigate the integration of DPE with real-time kinematics, extending the availability of high-precision PNT; 2) to secure GNSS receivers against malicious attacks, and ionospheric scintillation. DPE schemes will be leveraged to combat such interferences in combination with robust statistics, machine learning, and Bayesian inference tools. As a result, a transformative, unified framework will be conceived for sub-decimetric precision GNSS receivers that are both secure and can operate in denied scenarios but are not possible using current technology; and 3) to implement and validate the developed techniques on an end-to-end GNSS-SDR receiver, around which a research and educational plan is conceived to boost and consolidate the area of secure and ubiquitous PNT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efficiently processing large graphs has attracted significant attention due to its applications in various domains, such as biology, chemistry, and social network analysis.  With the explosion in the volume of data, graphs have become very large and can contain hundreds of billions of vertices and trillions of edges. Various applications also benefit from modeling the underlying data as a hypergraph, which enables relationships among multiple entities to be represented better than a graph.  In addition, many of these data sets are changing rapidly in real-time and applications require computing results on the latest data.  It is crucial to design high-performance parallel algorithms to enable analysis to be done on graphs and hypergraphs in a timely fashion.  However, writing efficient parallel code is notoriously difficult. Furthermore, many parallel algorithms used in practice today do not have strong theoretical guarantees, causing them to perform extremely poorly on certain inputs. To address these challenges, this project involves creating high-level programming frameworks with highly-optimized backends to make it easier for non-experts to write high-performance parallel programs for graphs and hypergraphs dealing with static and streaming data. This project also involves designing parallel algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in practice, so that they can perform well under all possible inputs and across many machine parameters, and scale gracefully to larger data sets.  Using the resulting algorithms and frameworks, scientists will be able to use high-level tools to perform graph and hypergraph analytics on massive inputs much more efficiently than before, both in theory and in practice.<br/><br/>This project involves designing new parallel primitives and algorithms for many fundamental graph and hypergraph problems that are fast and memory-efficient, both in theory and in practice.  The new algorithms are being evaluated on the largest publicly-available data sets using large-scale multicore machines. The project also involves creating high-level abstractions and programming frameworks to support the implementation of theoretically-efficient algorithms on both static and streaming data. First, a domain specific language for graph computations that generates efficient and highly-optimized code from high-level specifications of algorithms and optimizations will be designed.  Second, a unified framework for streaming graph analytics that can efficiently support parallel updates to the graph (simultaneously running algorithms and updates), incremental algorithms, and temporal analysis will be developed.  Finally, a novel abstraction and framework for hypergraph processing that will support theoretically-efficient implementations of hypergraph algorithms will be designed.  The results will lead to fundamental advances in parallel algorithm design and programming frameworks for graph and hypergraph analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluorescence is exhibited by many compounds and materials and provides information about the objects' molecular makeup and microstructure. While not usually directly visible to the eye, it can be made visible using controlled illumination and optical filters. The fast response of fluorescence to illumination is visible only to special ultrafast cameras. Interpretation of these signals significantly enhances conventional imaging capabilities, for example to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue, detect blood and other bodily fluids, assess plant health, match gunshot residue to a gun and gunpowder manufacturer, identify the paints used in paintings, and classify minerals. However, capturing the fluorescence spectra for all different possible illumination wavelengths along with their fast temporal behavior for each pixel in an image would lead to a high dimensional dataset involving immense amounts of data and is therefore impractical. To enable the use of fluorescence, this project therefore will design a flexible computational imaging system that is able to selectively and adaptively capture individual pieces of the multidimensional fluorescence signal.<br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit The high resolution information available in the optical light field along<br/>multiple dimensions presents a fundamental challenge to all imaging systems. The amount of<br/>data available for sampling far exceeds the collection, processing and storage capacities of even<br/>the most advanced computing equipment. Capturing it ultimately is limited not only by technical capabilities, but also by the total number of photons available to the imaging system.

Imaging systems are designed where a joint optimization is performed over computational feature space and available hardware components to perform selective sensing.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts This project will educate laymen and students about the prevalence of fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime and other ""hidden"" spectral phenomena in everyday scenes.

Recent development to optical tomography focuses on pushing the imaging depth, as motivated by many important needs including deep tissue imaging and brain photostimulations. However, existing optical tomography devices can only provide high-resolution imaging up to ~100 microns, limited by the single-scattering approximation. The goal of this CAREER program is to overcome this limitation by advancing both fundamental theory and practical devices. This program will establish novel multiple-scattering based tomography models that allow efficiently utilizing the information contained in the multiply scattered light.  A new type of optical devices based on the intensity diffraction tomography will be developed with simple experimental setups to facilitate easy adoption to existing microscope systems. The outcome of this program can enable scientific and biomedical discoveries by providing means to study biological samples and phenomena that would be otherwise not accessible, in areas such as histology, cytometry, brain mapping, and drug discovery.

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers, such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. This research project involves a coalition of investigators dedicated to advancing sustainable ecosystem services and maintaining essential biodiversity in agricultural landscapes with a focus on issues in vinicultural systems. Drivers such as soil fertility, pest regulation, biodiversity conservation, and crop production as a function of climate change that influence land use, economics, and policy decisions at the local, landscape, and regional level will be examined. The interdisciplinary research team, which includes members from the US academic sector, will develop and test predictive models that examine and integrate different land use and biodiversity scenarios across spatial scales for future farm management in viticultural regions across Europe.  Members of the team have extensive and well-documented collaborations with key stakeholders in the targeted regions including wine growers, non-governmental organizations, regional and national authorities, and extension service personnel. This research involves the iterative collection of input from stakeholders to help develop and test predictive models and to translate their results into a user-driven, decision-support tool that will provide wine-region vineyard farmers and regional authorities with better information and approaches on how to manage vinyards more sustainably and economically. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US, Austria, Germany, France, Spain, Romania, and The Netherlands. This large international collaboration will help build bridges collaboration and cooperation between countries and communities; engage stakeholders, ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, in the process; and develop a far-reaching and rich, publicly accessible data resource that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines.  In addition to its scientific impact, this project has societal impacts in terms of the economies of an important cash crop which will likely also impacts on US winegrowing regions. Additional impacts include the integration of research and education and the training of a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in the larger international consortium are dedicated to synthesizing pest-control data using government-sponsored databases from Spain, France, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, and Romania. The data will be used to develop statistical models that predict variation in pest and predator abundances across European vineyards. These models will be validated against independent field measurements, collected by European colleagues, of arthropod biodiversity, pest control, and economic performance along gradients of landscape complexity and management options across five case-study regions.  Results of the study will advance understanding of the consequences of various ecosystem services that try to address pressing challenges such as climate change, decline in worldwide biodiversity, invasive species, and unsustainable land use. Essential information from those intimately involved in vinicultural processes and land management will be collected via local focus groups which will generate stakeholder-driven scenarios. These case studies will be used to drive models that will be created and used to examine the most effective way of providing sustainable use. The validated models will be used to explore the biodiversity, ecosystem service, and crop production consequences of alternative land-use decisions under a range of social, economic and ecological restrictions.

Seed companies spend many years developing elite, inbred parental lines that are used to produce the hybrid seed that farmers plant each season. A major bottleneck in the plant breeding cycle is caused by the fact that it takes many years to produce these inbred parental lines.  The aim of this project is to develop a shortcut that allows inbred parental lines to be produced in a single year.  To accomplish this goal, the investigators plan to use gene editing techniques to generate novel onion plants that greatly accelerate the process of inbred line development.  The strategy deployed in this work should also be broadly applicable to other crops, making it of general use to the plant breeding community. This work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Jackson at the University of Warwick.<br/><br/>The investigators will use CRISPR/Cas9 methods to introduce genetic variation into the CENH3 gene of onion in order to produce haploid-inducer lines. A haploid-inducer line is a plant from which a significant fraction of the seed produced by cross-pollination is haploid.  Upon chemically-induced chromosome doubling, these haploid progeny become ""instant inbred"" lines that can be immediately used for hybrid seed production.  The research team at the University of Wisconsin will use T-DNA transformation and particle bombardment methods to deliver the gene editing reagents into onion somatic embryos, while the group at the University of Warwick will use tobacco rattle virus (TRV) expression vectors.  Deploying a variety of gene-editing strategies in parallel should allow the investigators to quickly determine which approach is the most effective for efficiently producing modified CENH3 alleles.  In order for doubled haploid technology to be commercially useful for hybrid seed production, it is essential that the strategies for producing doubled haploids are compatible with cytoplasmic male sterile breeding systems. For this reason, this project will integrate the production of haploid inducer lines within a cytoplasmic male sterile breeding framework in order to maximize the practical benefit and applicability to breeders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Material can be concentrated from the water, from sediments, and from the atmosphere into ice as it forms near shore, and as it is transported by currents into the open ocean. The processes by which many elements are incorporated into sea ice as it forms are poorly understood, however, in part because it requires being on site and sampling as the ice forms. The recent occurrence of very cold weather in the midwestern U.S. provided an opportunity to study these processes in large lakes, that can then be used to advance our understanding of sea ice. The RAPID funding mechanism allows a quick response to this unique weather event, at much lower cost than would be required to mount a similar study of Arctic sea ice. This study will take place in Lake St. Clair and surrounding rivers near Detroit, between Lakes Huron and Erie. The project will involve several undergraduate students and a graduate student. <br/><br/>To investigate the mechanism of incorporation of particle-reactive species into ice, the investigators will collect and analyze a suite of lake ice samples (ice thickness > 12 inches) from Lake St. Clair and rivers that discharge into Lake St. Clair as well as precipitation (both snow and rain) for 210Pb, 210Po and 7Be in southeast Michigan. The objective is to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of the activities of these isotopes in different sediment grain-sizes trapped in ice collected from different sites. The results from this study are anticipated to provide insights in answering two fundamental questions: i) what is the mechanism that leads to the enrichment (>100 times in some cases) of 210Pb and 7Be in sediments incorporated in ice (both in fresh water and seawater); and ii) how does the 210Po/210Pb activity ratio vary in sediment-depleted ice compared to sediment-laden ice? Since 7Be is completely derived from atmospheric deposition and ice-rafted sediment is highly enriched in 7Be, how much of the 210Po (210Po/210Pb < 0.1 in precipitation and in aerosol) in sediment- laden ice is derived from atmospheric deposition and from surface water? In addition, the study will involve collection of snow and atmospheric aerosols through the remainder of the winter, to understand atmospheric deposition of isotopes to ice and the lake surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER award will address this need through training the next generation of Earth analysts in data and compute-intensive science, cutting-edge ecosystem carbon measuring techniques, and large-team collaboration. <br/><br/>This award will advance fundamental understanding of how aboveground biomass recovery trajectories vary as a function of fire size and severity, drought, and conifer forest type (1984-present) across the western U.S. This research will: 1) apply emerging UAS technologies and methods to estimate tree-level aboveground biomass to then explore carbon recovery post-fire in the NEON southern Rockies domain; 2) explore fundamental drivers of carbon recovery post-disturbance across a chronosequence of fire history in conifer forests of the western U.S. using space-based observations; and 3) build a national network of over 100 ecosystem scientists, predominantly graduate students, who will be enabled to conduct data-intensive exploration of forest carbon dynamics in response to disturbance within NEON domains. Education efforts include a distributed graduate seminar taught simultaneously at five universities, open education modules delivered on Earth Lab's learning portal for Earth data science that currently reaches tens of thousands of users, and a Forest Carbon Codefest that will build collaborative efforts around key methodological advances, data coding challenges, and cloud-compute workflows. Overall this CAREER award will lead to better understanding of when forests shift from carbon sinks to carbon sources under changing fire regimes and help to train the next generation of data-capable Earth scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To combat these attacks, rapid and effective investigation is critical to understand attack paths and measure the damages. Unfortunately, forensic logging infrastructures are not efficient and effective enough. Many devices completely lack forensic logging systems and others rely on ineffective logging schemes, delaying or often completely preventing forensic investigation. This research aims to combat advanced cyber-attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that actively leverage emerging devices. It would design and develop fundamental security primitives that improve state-of-the-art forensic logging in terms of accuracy, efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and applicability. This research directly contributes to national security by advancing research in and developing techniques for the forensic investigation of advanced cyber-attacks exploiting emerging devices which have recently become a new major attack vector. The investigator is committed to the open and timely dissemination of the outcomes of the proposed research in order to encourage future research in this area. Also, the research will be integrated into new curriculum materials that the investigator will develop, including dedicated lab sessions on Internet of Things forensic analysis and associated APT investigation.<br/><br/>This research aims to design and develop fundamental security primitives for forensic logging: (1) Improving the current ineffective forensic logging systems that generate confusing forensic logs which hinder the forensic investigation significantly. (2) Reducing the space overhead of forensic logging systems to increase its applicability. (3) Enabling forensic analysis on unmodifiable devices (e.g., proprietary devices) that cannot be modified and instrumented via a novel forensic causality inference technique. This research provides the following unique set of capabilities that were not previously possible. First is the design and implementation of a novel event-execution path encoding scheme that can precisely capture event execution context information. This will allow forensic analysts to disambiguate confusing event logs. Second is a technique for instrumentation-free forensic analysis via causality inference.  Devices that do not allow any modification and instrumentation will be traced and analyzed via other devices that are connected to them leveraging a novel causality inference technique.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before there is 100% adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), we will have a mixed transportation system in which AVs share the roads with human-driven vehicles (HV).  This project investigates how driving styles of autonomous vehicles impact decision-making, trust, and acceptance of AVs both for the human operator and for human drivers in other vehicles. This project will benefit the design of AVs to promote drivers' trust of AVs in mixed traffic conditions, mitigate driver aggressiveness to improve driver safety, address public acceptance of autonomous vehicles, and smooth the transition into a future where autonomous driving is prevalent. It provides researchers and urban policy-makers knowledge and methods to evaluate the effects of AV technology on mixed transportation systems. This research will support the development of graduate-level curricula integrating research and practical design issues in human-vehicle interaction, providing an interdisciplinary education for students from Industrial Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.<br/>    <br/>This project addresses the transitional period of mixed driving systems that are expected to grow in the coming years by targeting three fundamental questions: (1) how to quantify the relationship between individual differences, trust, and decision-making in the interaction between an AV and the human operator; (2) how to investigate driver behavior and performance in the interaction between AV and human-driven vehicles; and (3) how to design driving styles of autonomous vehicles that can improve driver trust and acceptance of AV technology while mitigating the potential for offsetting behavior (e.g. drivers' tendency of additional risk taking when they feel safer).  Throughout the project, the effects of individual differences in driving style (aggressive vs conservative), the propensity to trust technology, and age, gender, and driving experience are explored empirically.  Corresponding design guidelines of AV driving styles will also be proposed to improve driver safety and promote driver trust of AVs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sea spray drops created by bubble bursting affect the exchange between the ocean and atmosphere by transporting water, heat, dissolved gases, salts, surfactants, and biological materials, and are major players in weather prediction and hurricane intensification. Large uncertainties in sea spray production predictions remain despite long standing efforts; this is attributed to the lack of knowledge in the original distribution of sea spray drop sizes and velocities. The research will span all scales relevant to the problem, from individual bubbles to wave statistics at the ocean surface; it will include detailed studies of the impact of key variables such as the concentration of surfactants, temperature, turbulence within a single experimental and numerical framework. A better understanding and improved parameterizations of sea spray production are necessary to improve the exchange between ocean-atmosphere of heat, moisture and aerosols, key elements of climate and weather models and forecast. Sea spray aerosols serve as cloud condensation nuclei and a better understanding of clouds generation and growth is seen by many as one of the biggest challenges in climate sciences. Sea spray is also related to health issues in coastal environments. When red tides are present, such as the Gulf of Mexico, blooms of harmful algae release toxins that can be transported as aerosols up to urban communities. The upscaling approach used in this study to connect the small scale, detailed processes to the larger scales of the ocean is general and could be used to improve the modeling of other ocean-atmosphere interactions as well. Through this project, undergraduate and graduate students at Princeton will be exposed to critical environmental challenges that require research on fundamental multi-phase flows. The project will also promote the use of open source methods through workshops and teaching activities.<br/><br/>The complex droplet formation process by collective bursting depends on multiple variables: the size and density of the bubbles rising in the turbulent upper ocean, the coalescence and foam formation at the surface and the physical-chemical properties of water. This project will fill gaps in our knowledge by conducting a comprehensive study that integrates high quality laboratory and numerical data to build models for the distribution of sizes and velocities of sea spray drops. Single bubble bursting will be studied with state of the art numerical simulations, developing a fundamental understanding at the bubble scale. The role physical and chemical variables, such as salinity, temperature and surfactant on the collective bubble bursting, foam aging and droplet formation will be investigated with laboratory experiments. Finally, an upscaling approach will be employed, going from one bubble plume entrained by a single breaking wave to the ocean scale by integrating the results over the breaking statistics, leading to a better parameterization of sea spray fluxes for numerical models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, written communications, whether public signage, billboards, books, instruction manuals, or even consumer electronics interfaces, depend on the purposeful deployment of typefaces and fonts. The typeface or font chosen in each case carries its own meaning, which influences the message received and resonates with readers through these shared cultural forms, even if readers are unaware. Surprisingly, considering typeface's ubiquity and importance, this area of social life has been little studied. Social scientists have examined typeface primarily in narrow, cognitive terms, such as by studying relative readability. But much wider research is needed to understand how the many different typefaces that populate societies are created, selected, and used, and how they ultimately build and influence communication.<br/><br/>Dr. Keith M. Murphy, an anthropologist at the University of California at Irvine, will undertake an ethnographic and discourse analytic investigation of how varieties of printed language mediate communication. The research will focus on typographic design and pedagogy; decision making around the use of typeface for public communication; and the curation and cultivation of typographic knowledge. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, video-recorded activity analyses, and archival research, in studios, classrooms, and archives, primarily in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. Data analysis will include an innovative use of techniques from archaeology to examine relations between typographic specimen categories and contexts of use. Findings from this research will elucidate how typeface influences the messages people send and receive.

Engineers working in these areas must currently rely on simplistic models and incomplete data to estimate transport in metals following laser excitation. This project seeks to replace such guess work with a concrete framework for modelling transport. The new framework will be extensively tested though experimentation. Using a combination of short optical and electrical pulses to heat nanoscale metal systems, this project will measure heat transfer over the time- and length-scales that cannot be predicted by existing theory. This research will be integrated with outreach to middle and high school students in the predominantly Hispanic local community surrounding UCR. The research will also be integrated with a mentoring program designed to get promising community college students involved in research and encourage them to transfer to UCR to pursue science and engineering degrees.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to identify, quantify, and ultimately control the electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes that govern heat flow in nanoscale metal multilayers. On time-scales shorter than electronic scattering processes, heat transfer can either be ballistic, superdiffusive, or diffusive. To identify the time- and length-scales over which various heat transfer regimes apply, and to quantify the governing electronic scattering processes, this project uses a combination of ultrafast thermometry methods such as wavelength-dependent time-domain thermoreflectance measurements, time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements, and temperature dependent electrical conductivity at THz frequencies.  These methods measure the evolution of heat in metal multilayers on sub-picosecond time-scales. Experimental data on the spatial and temporal evolution of heat in nanoscale metal layers are used to test first-principles based models for hot electron transport. The results of this project significantly advance the basic science of nanoscale heat transfer, and therefore allow improvements in technologies where thermal management is of critical importance, e.g. nanoelectronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this lack of oxygen, microbes living in these regions live in ways that differ from those in oxygenated waters consuming nitrate ions instead of oxygen for respiration.  Use of nitrate for microbial respiration results in the production of nitrogen gas which is called denitrification.  The resulting removal of nitrate has consequences for the whole ocean as nitrogen is an important nutrient controlling plant growth; however, whereas plants can use nitrogen in the form of nitrate, they cannot, with a few exceptions, use nitrogen gas. There remains a number of uncertainties regarding how much denitrification occurs in the ocean, what controls it, and how it varies in time and space.  Traditional studies of ocean denitrification have been limited by the time ships can be at sea and the relatively small proportion of the ocean they can observe.  Our project plans to remedy this problem by using vehicles called floats that can operate autonomously in the ocean for three years or more as they drift with currents over hundreds of kilometers.  We will outfit ten floats with sensors to measure oxygen and nitrogen gas which will be placed throughout the oxygen-depleted region of the Pacific Ocean to the west of Mexico.  This is the largest such region in the ocean from which we have two years of results from a prototype float which validated our approach.  This study may well transform our understanding of ocean denitrification and ultimately benefit society as a whole through greater confidence in predictions of the ocean's nitrogen cycle and capacity to fix carbon dioxide under current and future conditions.  Application and further development of float systems using commercially available technology will directly benefit successor studies, and more broadly showcase the use of water-following platforms to tackle difficult oceanographic problems. Advances from this study are expected to carry over to other disciplines including ocean biogeochemical modeling.  Outreach activities, support for an early career scientist, and student training are included in the project.  For the outreach activities, the investigators plan to tie into well-established after-school programs serving underrepresented populations in Massachusetts and established opportunities for public presentations using float related display materials at the University of Washington.  <br/><br/>Oxygen deficient zones (ODZs), despite constituting a small fraction of total oceanic volume, play important roles in regulating global ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles including hosting 30 to 50% of the global loss of fixed nitrogen. Unfortunately, current uncertainty in ODZ nitrogen loss derives from substantial temporal and spatial variability in rates that remain under-sampled by ship-based measurements. While local regulation of nitrogen loss by oxygen and organic matter availability are well accepted, temporal/spatial variability in the nitrogen flux is likely a result of the influence of physical forcings such as remote ventilation, seasonal variability, and mesoscale eddies. Understanding how the impact of physical forcings on nitrogen loss as mediated through oxygen and organic flux will be required to fully understand the causes and consequences of any future ODZ expansion. To improve our understanding of ODZ nitrogen loss, we will carry out a multiyear, autonomous float-based observational program to address outstanding questions regarding bioavailable nitrogen loss in ODZs.  As the largest ODZ and region of our pilot deployments, our operation area will be the Eastern Tropical N. Pacific (ETNP) where our study will determine over a multi-year period, in-situ nM-level oxygen and biogenic nitrogen on float profiles spanning geographic gradients in oxygen and surface productivity. For the first time, our study will also determine in situ nitrogen loss rates from changes in nitrogen concentration during 1 to 2 week Lagrangian float drifts along a constant density surface. A pilot 2 yr float deployment in the ETNP documents our ability to do so. Critically, our float-based approach more closely matches the frequency and distribution of observations to the expected variability in biogenic nitrogen production as compared to prior work and will dramatically increase the data density for this region by acquiring >500 profiles/drifts for nitrogen and >1000 profiles for nM oxygen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a decreasing stroke mortality and increase in the aging population, the number of people requiring rehabilitation after a stroke is projected to increase, creating a critical need to improve the effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation services. To address this challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project introduces a new robot-aided rehabilitation framework, namely Transparent Robot-Aided Rehabilitation (TRAIN). This framework builds upon ""enhanced transparency"" in two distinct aspects: (1) transparency in terms of understanding altered biomechanics following stroke and (2) transparency in physical human-robot interaction, i.e., the concept of a robot being physically imperceptible to a human during motor tasks. The project focuses on developing the TRAIN framework for shoulder rehabilitation and testing the effectiveness for stroke survivors. Shoulder dysfunction is one of the most common complications following stroke, but robot-aided shoulder rehabilitation has not yet been fully explored. Successful application of the TRAIN framework to robotic shoulder exercise therapy will directly benefit the overall motor function of the upper extremity including improved range of motion, strength, and stability. In addition, successful application will lead to secondary benefits of improving the quality of life, such as reduced fatigue during motor tasks and improved independence in daily activities. Research activities and outcomes of this project will be seamlessly integrated into various education and outreach programs in order to excite and attract a diverse group of students, inspire them to pursue careers in STEM, and train next-generation scientists and engineers in robotics and human movement science. A unique ""Outreach on Demand"" program will promote outreach opportunities for underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to advance robot-aided rehabilitation through integrated innovations in robot design, controller design, and refined quantification (system identification) of the neuromuscular system. Toward this goal, this project will produce a transformative framework for shoulder rehabilitation using integrated innovations in robot design (a lightweight, parallel-actuated shoulder exoskeleton robot), system identification (refined quantification of 3D shoulder impedance), and controller design (a biomechanics-based active impedance controller). Integration of a novel lightweight, parallel-actuated shoulder exoskeleton robot that minimally impacts natural arm dynamics, in combination with a fast and robust system identification algorithm, will advance understanding of how brain injury due to stroke alters 3D shoulder impedance.  The Research Plan is organized under 4 thrusts.  The FIRST THRUST is to develop a 5-DOF lightweight, parallel, actuated shoulder exoskeleton Robot.  The robot will consist of a fully-actuated/motor driven 3-DOF spherical parallel manipulator (SPM) and a 2-DOF passive slip interface.  The SPM consists of three parallel actuators connected to a shoulder piece coupled to the user; the slip interface is a cuff placed on the user's upper arm and is also coupled to the shoulder piece.  The actuators are coupled to provide access to a spherical workspace.  The optimal configuration of the robot will be determined and its ability to apply precise perturbations and simulate a wide range of impedances at the shoulder joint will be evaluated.  The SECOND THRUST is to quantify 3D shoulder impedance during dynamic motor Tasks.  Using the optimized robot, a robust system identification algorithm well be developed to quantify 3D shoulder impedances (stiffness, damping and inertia) in the direction of arm movements in young subjects with no history of neuromuscular disorders.  The robot and algorithms developed will then be used to determine how shoulder impedance during normal shoulder functions is altered in stroke patients with chronic hemiparesis. The THIRD THRUST is to develop a biomechanics-based active impedance controller. An active impedance controller will further enhance transparency by altering the damping resistance from the robot in response to the user's intent of motion, e. g., to lower damping to reduce the experience of undesired resistance when the user intends to move in a direction.  The effectiveness of the controller, i.e. its ability to increase transparency by lowering muscle activity/effort, will then be assessed in the Thrust 2 stroke patients.  The FOURTH THRUST is to develop and evaluate patient-specific, adaptive exercise therapy based on the TRAIN Framework.  Based on quantification of altered shoulder impedance in each stroke patient participating in earlier Thrusts, robotic exercise therapy that aims to correct altered shoulder impedance towards the unimpaired baseline (as determined from age-matched unaffected controls) will be developed.  A 6-week (12 sessions) patient specific robotic training program that provides a unique set of strengthening and stretching exercises will be designed to adjust robotic impedance based on assessment of the patient's motor performance. Finally, the exercise program will be evaluated in the patients for whom they were designed and the effects on improvement of shoulder motor function will be assessed post training and at a 3-month follow-up.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those fortunate enough to avoid the scrutiny of the justice system never need exercise these rights. Those who do find themselves entangled in the criminal justice system also rarely exercise these rights. Today's accused frequently forgo their right to a trial, and all related rights, by entering a guilty plea. Guilty pleas have been increasing over the last 40 years and now account for over 95% of criminal convictions. The shift away from trials and toward pleas has unquestionably increased judicial efficiency, allowing defendants faster case resolutions. Consequently, it is not the increase in pleas, but the increase in false guilty pleas--cases in which a defendant subsequently proven innocent pleads guilty--that is particularly worrying. The National Registry of Exonerations has reported that guilty pleas were a factor in approximately 15% of wrongful conviction cases, but believes that many more false guilty pleas have never, and will never be discovered. Juvenile defendants are especially vulnerable to pleading guilty falsely. Given the transformation of our criminal justice system to one of pleas, it is of critical importance that we increase our understanding of what factors might lead one to plead guilty, especially when factually innocent.<br/><br/>Our current understanding of the ""deals"" that lead so many to plead guilty is often tied to the shadow-of-the-trial (SoT) model, which posits that plea outcomes rely solely on the discrepancy in penalties from a plea deal versus a trial conviction, factoring in the probability of conviction at trial. Yet, research has shown that both the actual guilt status and age of the accused can significantly and systematically impact plea outcomes. Thus, the research will be conducted with two broad objectives: 1) testing the predictive validity of the SoT model against an updated model, which incorporates an interactive effect of guilt status and age on plea outcomes; and 2) expanding, testing, and disseminating novel plea-simulation software designed for both research and educational purposes. The research will employ a 2 (innocent or guilty) x 3 (conviction probability: 20%, 50%, or 80%) x 3 (plea penalty/offer: 6 months, 12 months, or 18 months) between-participants design. We will recruit a sample of college students, an adult sample, and a juvenile sample. The results of the proposed research could have important policy implications regarding current plea procedures. If, for instance, significant penalty discrepancies are shown to impact the innocent more than the guilty, it would provide justification for reining in the discounts prosecutors can offer during plea negotiations.

Such observations have motivated laboratory experiments to replicate astrophysical phenomena. Concurrently, there has been development of computational modeling capabilities aimed at reproducing results from both observations and experiments. The goal of this project is to conclusively address the existing discrepancies between numerical simulations and real world measurements in regimes of relevance to astrophysics. Novel numerical tools to be developed as part of this study will have broad applicability to fundamental science questions, national security, energy, and spacecraft engineering.  The strongly integrated education plan will engage students from K-12 through graduate school in research and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through an online user experience. The education and outreach activities will also strive to encourage women and under-represented groups to pursue STEM careers through collaborations with the Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity at Virginia Tech and minority-serving community colleges in Virginia.<br/><br/>In high-energy-density regimes, numerical simulations have been unable to reproduce the results from experiments and observations for decades. The state-of-the-art in numerical simulations of high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory plasmas uses fluid models, specifically radiation-hydrodynamic and radiation-magnetohydrodynamic models. Significant deficiencies in these single-fluid models include the inability to capture physics effects included in more advanced high-fidelity multi-fluid models.  The missing physics can notably impact plasma transport, which may have significant anisotropies. Furthermore, the effect of non-thermal particle population on plasma transport may be missed even by most advanced fluid models. The key to matching experimental data has been to include ad hoc tunable parameters in fluid simulations. What is necessary, but has been impractical until recently due to computational limitations, are first-principles high-dimensional kinetic calculations that can address conclusively whether the discrepancies between experiments and hydrodynamic codes could be explained using kinetic physics. The present study will include first-principles kinetic calculations using a novel, continuum-kinetic, high-order accurate, and computationally efficient algorithm to study plasma dynamics and transport in the presence of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in high-energy-density plasmas. This project will address long-standing discrepancies between high-energy-density experiments and simulations and, as a result, could significantly advance our understanding of plasma transport with implications in a number of research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The area of application for TTS technology that motivates this research is its use for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). According to the American Speech-Language and Hearing Association (ASHA), more than two million people in the United States have severe communication disorders that impair their ability to talk. AAC devices that use TTS to create spoken output are used by many of these people to support communication. Historically, AAC users have had access to a relatively small family of generic TTS voices that are neither unique to them nor typically age- or dialect-appropriate. However, advances in TTS technology make it possible to create personalized synthetic voices that capture the unique vocal identity of AAC device users if they are able to record enough speech. This allows patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS to ""bank"" their voice - that is, to record examples of their speech that can later be used to create a personal TTS voice - before the disease progresses to a point that they can no longer speak. Unfortunately, one major barrier to voice banking, especially for patients who may already be experiencing some difficulty speaking, is the amount of speech needed to create a natural sounding TTS voice that fully captures the vocal identity of the voice banker. To reduce this barrier, this research will combine a type of speech synthesis called parallel formant synthesis that was developed several decades ago, with deep learning computational techniques that allow a computer to learn how to control the parameters of the parallel formant synthesizer to reproduce the speech of a target speaker given examples of the target speaker's speech. A parallel formant synthesizer will be implemented and trained to model speech recorded by voice bankers, and its output will be compared with that of other synthesizers that have been trained with the same speech data. Objective measures of similarity between synthetic and natural utterances, and subjective measures of voice quality and similarity using human listeners, will be used. This will be the first step toward building a parallel formant synthesis-based voice conversion system capable of creating TTS voices from a small number of natural speech samples, and also better able to model the expressive nature of natural speech.<br/><br/>Despite advances in TTS technology, there are multiple challenges to the application of this technology for voice banking. Specifically: (a) the amount of speech required (several hours) to create the most natural sounding TTS voices using unit selection or hybrid DNN/unit selection is prohibitive for most voice bankers; (b) existing voice conversion techniques that do not require large amounts of parallel speech from the target talker generally produce speech sounding less natural and less like the target speaker when compared to concatenative synthesis; and (c) both concatenative and statistical parametric techniques produce speech that is only as expressive as the data within the speech corpus from which they have been constructed or trained. Parallel formant synthesis, because it is based explicitly on the perceptually most salient features of natural speech and lends itself to independently modeling laryngeal, suprasegmental, and segmental features should be better able to address all three of these challenges. As proof of concept, a parallel formant synthesis (PFS) vocoder with DNN-based parameter estimation will be implemented. The vocoder will be implemented within the Merlin DNN synthesis framework so that speech output of the PFS system can be directly compared to output generated by the World and MagPhase vocoders. Training will be based on corpora drawn from the same set of 1600 utterances recorded by multiple individuals who have contributed their recordings to the ModelTalker project. The selected target talkers will be balanced for gender and span a wide range of English dialects, but use of speakers with noticeable levels of dysarthria will be avoided. Objective comparisons will be based on Mel-Cepstral Difference (MCD) between synthetic and natural sentence tokens that were not used in training the synthesizers. Subjective measures (Mean Opinion Scores) will be obtained from human listeners via Amazon Mechanical Turk.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, an image classification service would take an image as a query and respond with a prediction of whether there is a car in the image. Prediction-serving systems are increasingly important for a wide variety of applications today. These systems are typically run in large-scale computing infrastructures, where failures and slowdowns are common. Such unavailability results in significant increase in the query-response latency, thereby degrading the quality-of-service. The research project designs and implements a resource-efficient solution for robustness in prediction-serving systems using a tool from the domain of coding theory called ""erasure-coded computation"".<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to design and implement a solution for reducing the potential long latency in prediction-serving systems using erasure-coded computations. The project overcomes critical limitations in existing coded-computation solutions by employing machine learning in a novel way. Specifically, the project involves the following key tasks: (1) Designing a low-overhead coded-computation solution that efficiently supports complex non-linear functions by employing a learning-based approach; (2) Designing an efficient training methodology conforming to the constraints of real-world prediction-serving systems; and (3) System design and implementation.<br/><br/>The software resulting from the project will be integrated into open-source prediction-serving systems for use in both research and education.

Although they are traditionally operated independently, they are interconnected and interdependent. The interdependency is manifested through the electricity consumption of water services facilities, such as pumping, treatment, and wastewater management. It is becoming recognized by various stakeholders that socio-economic benefits can be reaped from the coordinated operation of coupled infrastructure components and services in an urban district. The objective of this project is thus to put forth a framework that addresses challenges in resource management for coupled electricity distribution networks and water distribution systems. The potential benefits include more reliable and economic delivery of electricity and water to the end-user. Furthermore, this project supports education through enhancement of the power engineering curriculum at the University of Texas at San Antonio as well as outreach to high school students and local community colleges.<br/><br/>This project puts forth novel multi-period optimization methods for optimal asset utilization and resource scheduling in electricity distribution grids and water distribution systems. Specifically, the multi-phase operation of electricity distribution grids with wye and delta connection variants is explicitly modeled. Tight polyhedral relaxations for optimal power flow in distribution grids with step-voltage regulators are developed and are extended to account for other utility or end-user assets. Novel optimization schemes building on contraction mappings and penalty methods overcome the nonconvex and nondifferentiable nature of the hydraulic equations that govern water distribution systems. Comprehensive models for energy-optimal joint management of electricity and water distribution systems are developed. The physical coupling between the two networks is explicitly accounted for, while optimized multi-period pump and water tank operation takes advantage of the inherent time flexibility and can provide a form of energy storage. The developed models can also be incorporated in distribution service restoration sequences. The research is validated with a real-time power network simulator at the University of Texas at San Antonio.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in the decades since most water infrastructure was constructed in the western U.S., the burned area, frequency, and severity of wildfires has increased considerably. While wildfires can have short-term impacts on the quantity and quality of water supply, the erosion that occurs after severe burns can also deliver significant amounts of sediment to rivers and downstream reservoirs, reducing the long-term storage capacity of water supplies. Further, with projected future increases in wildfire, there will be increases in river sediment. Thus, in this project the researchers will develop new computer-based modeling tools capable of identifying and quantifying the risk that post-wildfire erosion poses to downstream water infrastructure. The first application of this modeling framework will be the water supply reservoirs throughout Utah, one of the driest states in the U.S., where the vulnerability of each reservoir will be quantified as to the erosion and sedimentation risk posed by wildfire. Similar to dammed reservoirs across the nation, sedimentation in Utah reservoirs is a growing concern for aging water infrastructure, even before accounting for the projected increases in future wildfire. Finally, the researchers will integrate their model into online, open-source programs, making these resources available to any person or agency interested in applying the model to other states or regions. The deliverables of this project will provide critical information and tools for improved and more targeted forest management, help identify and protect vulnerable water resources, and address crucial knowledge gaps for predicting downstream impacts from post-wildfire erosion. Collaborating across two universities, this project will provide support for one post-doctoral researcher (PI Murphy), two PhD students, and a minimum of six undergraduate students to train and develop their skills in hydrology, geomorphology, data analysis and management, and science communication. <br/><br/>This project will advance fundamental knowledge critical for predicting the locations and timing of post-wildfire sediment delivery to downstream water infrastructure. The researchers will link new and existing models that: 1) predict the locations and magnitudes of post-wildfire erosion, 2) route post-wildfire sediment inputs downstream through river networks in a physics-based and hydro-geomorphically sensitive manner, and 3) determine a range of potential volumetric sediment inputs to downstream reservoirs under a range of wildfire conditions. Applying this new modeling framework to the 133 major reservoirs throughout Utah, this project will answer four key research questions: 1) Which water supply reservoirs in Utah are most vulnerable to post-wildfire erosion? 2) What is the time lag between occurrence of a wildfire and loss of reservoir storage downstream? 3) Which landscape, fire, hydrologic, and vegetation characteristics exert the strongest control on the upstream storage vs. delivery of post-fire sediment to reservoirs? 4) What landscape, fire and river network attributes control the relative increase in post-wildfire sediment yields above background yields? Through this analysis, the researchers will specifically assess the influence of sediment connectivity on reservoir vulnerability, as well as the contribution of coarse sediment inputs to the reductions in reservoir storage over longer transport timescales. Given the complex ownership and management of dams, they will engage a stakeholder advisory group that spans the diverse range of ownership and includes public utilities departments, state and federal forest management agencies, and dam operators. Further, they will work with the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) to integrate their models into open-source platforms, and create a public platform to host the project datasets, educational materials, technical reports, and publications. This project represents research at the frontier of integrated geosciences, and this new modeling framework fills a critical gap regarding the tools needed to assess urgent societal concerns regarding wildfire and water security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human-ignited fires, drought, large fuel loads, and non-native vegetation have made urban streams and rivers into avenues for fire movement. Very little is known about these new urban fires and the impacts on local ecosystems. The goal of this research is to understand and predict changes in vegetation, soil, and stream processes that occur after fires. Areas adjacent to streams, called riparian zones, are important in controlling the impacts of fires by regulating the release of pollutants and the erosion of soil into streams. Yet these riparian processes are poorly understood in urban stream corridors. Remote sensing methods provide detailed images of the Earth's surface from satellites and airplanes. Examining repeated images through time can allow researchers to document changes in erosion and to relate those changes to differences in riparian vegetation and stream conditions. The data collected from this project can be incorporated into mathematical models to make predictions about erosion and sediment following fires that can lead to poor water quality. The proposed research will include educational and outreach activities with San Diego State University and local community college students. Students from community colleges in San Diego County will be invited to participate in this research and will be encouraged to pursue higher education in science and engineering. This work will also increase community education opportunities and interactions through public seminars and outreach events. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Human-ignited fires, drought, large fuel loads, and non-native vegetation have made urban streams and rivers into corridors for fire movement. The increase in human interactions in fire-prone areas can significantly alter hydrologic and sediment yield processes, which can transport contaminants to urban waterways. This research will contribute new fundamental knowledge on short- and long-term post-fire recovery processes in urban Mediterranean stream systems. The goal of this work is to understand coupled sediment and riparian zone interactions using a combination of field, remote sensing, statistical, and modeling approaches to describe and predict post-fire changes. Specific research objectives include: 1) establishing non-linear spatial and temporal relations between vegetation patterns and sediment volume within the upland and riparian zones after fire; 2) coupling the recovery trajectory of in situ volumetric sedimentation and hydrologic response after fires with satellite-based imagery of upland and riparian vegetation; and 3) developing a mass balance model to predict sediment flux following fires due to the evacuation of sediment stored behind vegetation. Light detection and ranging will provide detailed images of the landscape, allowing documentation of the storage and supply of sediment as a function of non-native and native vegetation and hydrologic conditions. Satellite imagery will augment these relationships and document interactions at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. This information will be incorporated into a mass balance model to predict sediment contributions, which can be a source for degraded water quality following fires.

Effective control of the heat transport remains a technological challenge because major heat carriers in solid materials are typically less sensitive to external influence. This CAREER project examines the theoretical basis and practical feasibility of a novel means to control heat transport in solids: using external electromagnetic fields to significantly alter the heat transfer processes. This project not only advances our fundamental understanding of energy transport in state-of-the-art materials and devices, but also benefits the society by providing new practical strategies to design more efficient and sustainable energy systems. This CAREER project also focuses on raising the workforce readiness for next-generation renewable energy technologies by exposing K-12 and undergraduate students to hands-on renewable energy harvesting projects, and promoting the diversity of the renewable energy field by providing research opportunities to undergraduate researchers from underrepresented minority communities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how the interaction between phonons and electrons can modify the thermal transport properties of solid-state materials. This project is motivated by our recent finding that phonon-electron scattering can become the dominant phonon scattering mechanism in semiconductors with high electron concentrations at room temperature. Theoretically, state-of-the-art first-principles phonon-electron scattering calculation with coupled Boltzmann transport equations will be employed to understand phonon damping and amplification by phonon-electron scattering, reveal key factors that determine the strength of phonon-electron scattering and identify materials with strong phonon-electron scattering for potential thermal switching applications. Experimentally, ultrafast optical and electron spectroscopic methods will be developed and applied to characterize the phonon-electron scattering strength for phonon modes with different frequencies, momenta and polarizations and demonstrate solid-state thermal switching by modifying phonon-electron scattering via external photoexcitation and electrostatic gating. This CAREER project not only generates new insights for energy transfer processes in devices with high electron concentrations, but also provides transformative opportunities to develop novel functional energy materials and devices based on the interaction of microscopic energy carriers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While both fields have enjoyed spectacular successes, their algorithms can be brittle and can drive applications to unexpected failures. The cause of many failures in both machine-learning and PBE systems can be traced back to their shared task of inductive reasoning: learning some artifact in a hypothesis space from a set of examples. Since examples are inherently incomplete specifications, there can be a large number of artifacts that fit a set of examples but fail to generalize to an unseen example. This project advocates for a more principled approach to constructing such inductive reasoning engines based on a formal characterization of their reliability.<br/> <br/>The project casts the problem of reliability of these systems as one of robustness: is the change in the artifact learnt acceptable, or, at least predictable, in the presence of small changes to the set of examples?

The goal of this study is to examine whether such selective advantages hold for Mandarin, one of the hardest languages for English speakers to acquire. This study investigates whether, when both Mandarin proficiency and the dominant language (English) are held constant, early age of acquisition confers an advantage to heritage speakers over second language learners, and whether this depends on the linguistic domain (phonology, morpho-semantics, syntax, and syntax-semantics interface). Three groups (native speakers, heritage speakers and second language learners) will complete three psycholinguistic tasks testing four Mandarin linguistic phenomena: tone sandhi, aspect marking, relative clauses, and long-distance reflexives. These are chosen because (i) they represent different subdomains in linguistics, (ii) they differ regarding the age of acquisition in monolingual children, and (iii) English and Mandarin differ on these phenomena, which is important for both pedagogical and linguistic reasons. The results will contribute to the fields of Chinese linguistics and language acquisition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The circulation of seawater through deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems results in the extensive transformation of both inorganic and organic carbon compounds and may have a significant impact on the deep ocean carbon cycle. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on methane and light hydrocarbons. The distribution and abundance of other types of organic compounds, however, remains poorly known. As a result, the contribution of hydrothermal systems to organic carbon in the deep ocean and the biogeochemical processes responsible for this input, remain highly uncertain. This research conducts a comprehensive study of the composition and abundance of carbon compounds from fluids discharging from two very different, but closely located, hydrothermal vents on the ultraslow spreading mid-Cayman rise in the Caribbean Sea. The two vent sites are located in substantially different host rocks and occur at very different water depths. They also have very different vent fluid temperatures.  Fluids will be collected using multiple, complementary sampling systems and analyzed by various mass spectrometric and other analytical techniques. Comparison between these two sites allows carbon fluxes and chemical transformations to be determined over a range of physical and chemical conditions. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art geochemical methods and provide them with an opportunity to gain experience and training in sea-going research in a strongly interdisciplinary subject. A graduate and several undergraduate students from the University of South Carolina, an EPSCoR state (i.e., a state that does not receive significant federal dollars); Bridgewater State University, which serves economically disadvantaged communities in Massachusetts; and the University of Colorado at Boulder will be involved in the research and play key roles in both the scientific cruise and supporting laboratory activities.<br/><br/>In ocean crust, extensive transformations occur to the carbon compounds present in both the fluids and solids on and below the seafloor due to processes such as heating, precipitation of minerals, injections of magma, and the activity of microorganisms. These processes have consequences for global elemental cycling in the present day and over geologic time. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on small, volatile organic molecules such as methane. However, the abundance and fate of other types of organic compounds remains poorly known. To better understand these transformations and the amount of carbon in seafloor hydrothermal systems and their potential impact on deep sea microbes and ecology, samples of hydrothermal fluids emanating from two compositionally and thermally different seafloor vent systems on the mid-Cayman rise (Piccard and von Damm) will be collected on a 16-day oceanographic cruise using a robotic vehicle. Samples will be analyzed for their carbon content and carbon compounds using mass spectrometric and other analytical tools. Goals of the project are to addresses issues such as: (1) the relative contribution of abiotic synthesis, thermal alteration of biomass, fluid-rock interaction, and microbial activity to the inventory of carbon compounds in ridge-crest hydrothermal fluids, (2) how host rock, style of venting, and temperature influence the generation and stability of reduced carbon compounds in axial hot-springs, (3) the fate of seawater-derived dissolved organic carbon during circulation through the oceanic lithosphere, and (4) which organic compounds and signatures are the best geochemical indicators of fluid reaction history. Three different sampling devices will be employed to ensure the full range of carbon containing compounds is captured. Collected samples will be analyzed for bulk characteristics (dissolved organic carbon concentrations and isotopes) and for the composition and isotope characteristics of individual compounds, ranging from volatile (e.g. methane and light hydrocarbons) to non-volatile (e.g. fatty acids), and from labile (e.g. amino acids) to refractory (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). These data will permit the calculation of carbon and isotope mass balances at each location. From this, a comparison of the fate of carbon in both systems will be carried out to evaluate the importance of rock type, temperature, and style of venting on the carbon-bearing compounds present in seafloor hydrothermal vents. Additional measurements will be made with non-targeted, broad spectrum organic compound analyses to identify alteration trends and carbon compound evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important objectives of this modernization is to achieve a high degree of supply autonomy of electricity consumers from their local electric power utilities, which is motivated by the need to ensure a higher level of reliability and energy efficiency. In practice, this supply autonomy is achieved by rolling out customer-end distributed energy resources (DERs), which include, but not limited<br/>to, photovoltaic panels, battery energy storage, and demand-side management solutions. If these DERs are appropriately sized and operated, electricity consumers are shown to significantly reduce, if not completely eliminate, their dependency on the electricity supply from their utilities. While this supply autonomy offers significant reliability and economic benefits, it also reduces revenues streams of utilities and undermines their financial viability. As a response to these reductions, utilities in many US regions have already started increasing electricity tariffs, thus further incentivizing remaining consumers to adopt DERs. This self-fueling process (colloquially known as the utility's death spiral) calls for urgent changes to the current US power grid architecture to integrate DERs in societally acceptable and socially responsible manner. The goal of this project is to design a peer-to-peer energy exchange platform that will manage customer-end DERs using the utility's network infrastructure.  Broader impact activities of this project include (a) graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, (b) summer research opportunities for undergraduate and high-school minority students via NYU's Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering program, (c) collaborative work with St. Anthony's High School in Melville, NY on new computer science course.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to fundamentally re-think and re-engineer the current US power grid architecture to accommodate a massive penetration level of customer-end DERs, while improving the overall reliability, resiliency, and energy efficiency of the power sector. The proposed solution rests on the following two ideas. First, we will design a peer-to-peer platform that will manage customer-end DERs using the utility's network infrastructure and decentralized, continuous-time control policies, which account for network physics and operating limits. Second, the proposed peer-to-peer platform will be coupled with an AC-power-flow-based energy management system typical for US utilities. This coupling will make it possible to design and compute appropriate network usage charges that peers will pay for using utilities' infrastructure. These network charges will generate an additional revenue stream intended to offset the<br/>drop in the utility's revenue caused by the roll-out of customer-end DERs. Based on these two key ideas, we will develop a multi-year planning model that will optimize the nation-wide transition to a peer-centric power grid architecture and fully harvest techno-economic benefits of smart grid technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The environmental cues or genes that initiate this male/female-determination differ across species, and they can even be variable within a species. It is not well understood how ecological factors contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in male/female-determination within species. To address this shortcoming, this research uses the house fly as a model system because this species has substantial variation in how the male/female decision is made. Notably, there are two common ways that male development can be initiated, and they differ in their geographical distributions. One male-determining variant predominates at northern latitudes, and the other is more common in the south. The researchers are investigating if the two different variants are both maintained because they are beneficial at different temperatures. In addition, female development can be initiated independently from the male-determining variants in house fly. The researchers are also investigating if the variants that initiate male development have deleterious effects in females. These antagonistic effects could further explain why variation in male/female-determination is maintained in house fly populations. Undergraduate students training to be high school teachers will contribute to this research. Those students will work with the researchers to provide continuing education training to current teachers. They will also lead middle and high school classrooms in exercises that use house flies to illustrate core concepts in genetics and evolution. These activities will impact students from under-served communities that are under-represented in the sciences.<br/><br/>To determine how natural selection can maintain variation in male/female-determination, the researchers are combining laboratory experiments, surveys of natural populations, and genomic techniques. Specifically, the research tests the hypothesis that male/female-specific genotype-by-environment interactions affect selection pressures acting on Y chromosomes to maintain variation in male/female-determination in house fly. The environment-dependent phenotypic effects of very young Y chromosomes will be assessed using laboratory experiments and high throughput gene expression profiling. Predictions about allele frequencies in laboratory populations and over seasons in the wild will be tested, and fitness effects will be modeled. The hypothesis that suppressed recombination maintains linkage between male-determining genes and other genetic variation with male/female-antagonistic or environment-specific effects will be evaluated using recombination mapping, genome sequencing, and population genetic data to test for X-Y differentiation. This research connects ecologically relevant selection pressures and male-female conflict with the evolution of an essential developmental pathway, joining population genetics and the evolution of development in a single framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. U.S. families are changing, reflecting the rapid economic, political, demographic, and technological transformation of society and forecasting the future. These changes can be seen in how adults partner and have children as well as evolving norms of gender relations, children's experiences, and extended networks of support and obligation. Changes in family life is, in turn, intricately related to the diversification of the U.S. population as a result of increased immigration over many decades coupled with differential fertility across racial/ethnic groups. In many ways, changes in family behaviors are adaptive for all Americans. The implications of these changes, however, play out differently across racial/ethnic groups. To understand how family change is differentially experienced across diverse segments of the U.S. population, how racial/ethnic diversity accelerates or slows family change, and how racialized family change reflects, reinforces, and reduces broader patterns of inequality and discrimination, the field of family demography needs to train and support a new generation of scholars who can produce theoretically grounded and methodologically rigorous knowledge and use it to inform policy and practice. The Race, Ethnicity, and Demography of U.S. Families Program at the University of Texas at Austin aims to explore these questions. <br/><br/>This REU site is an eight-week summer program designed to help students develop research skills and technical abilities in family demography and quantitative analysis, and to prepare them for graduate study or employment following graduation. Using a team-based pedagogical approach based at the Population Research Center (PRC) of the University of Texas Austin, this site will select top students and expose them to the scientific study of demography, race/ethnicity, and families, and train them in data analysis, including working with large data sets, estimating regressions and population forecasts, and guide them in report writing. Students will be taught and mentored by top scholars at the PRC, assisting them as they develop their specific research interests. Students will also work with scholars at Child-Family Research Partnership (CFRP) and the Texas Demographic Center, local- and state-level research institutes that conduct demographic research used to create effective and targeted public policy. By the end of the summer, students will complete an independent research product, either a research paper, which can be presented at a national academic conference or a policy brief, which can be presented to local stakeholders. Students will also participate in workshops designed to prepare them for graduate school and/or professional employment in the data analytics field. Taken together, this program will help develop and support research on family change and diversify the next generation of scholars conducting basic and applied research in an array of professional settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most striking Arctic observations in the 21st century has been a reduction in both sea-ice extent and thickness, and an increase of freshwater content in the BG region. At present, there are insufficient observations or theories to reach a consensus among the different opinions about these changes and their impact on climate. The BG summer freshwater content has increased by 6,600 km3 since 2003. Not only does this have important consequences for Arctic sea-ice, ocean thermodynamics, and ecosystems, but a possible fresh water release from the Arctic of this magnitude is enough to cause a salinity anomaly in the North Atlantic with a magnitude comparable to the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s, which could influence global climate by reducing the ocean meridional overturning circulation and result in cooling. Thus, the BG system is a potential source to force significant climate changes, likely at decadal time scales. Data returned from this project and distributed freely via the project website and archived with the NSF Arctic Data Center will continue to advance our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological drivers of environmental change in the Arctic, their relationship to the climate system, and linkages to global processes. Long-term time series of project data will facilitate numerical model initialization and validation and stimulate general interest in Arctic science issues. The knowledge gained under this project will continue to be vital to a wide variety of Arctic processes and climate studies, to operational forecasting and other Arctic research programs, and will spur further valuable investigations of the Arctic Ocean. This project will continue to expand international cooperation and promote widespread access to Arctic for both researchers and the general public. Educational activities will include training of graduate students providing them the opportunity to participate in BG cruises and advising them in BG data analysis. The project data will continue to be used by the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project and Arctic community to validate and improve Arctic regional and global models, test hypotheses, and answer scientific questions.<br/><br/>The Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) will be continued throughout 2019-2020 to observe a set of environmental parameters using bottom-anchored moorings and shipboard measurements to continue the long-term time-series at standard locations. Ship-based synoptic sampling covering the entire BG will continue to be performed each summer in collaboration with Canadian scientists to observe reversal of the climatic circulation regime that has been persistent in one sense over the observation period. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, barium, CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, alkalinity, total CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, tritium/3-He and delta-O-18 will continue to be measured and analyzed along sections at 140W, 150W, ~75N and ~78N using a shipboard CTD/rosette. Between CTD/rosette casts, expendable CTDs that profile to 1100m depth will continue to be used to increase spatial resolution of the temperature and salinity fields. Three BGOS moorings redeployed in 2018 will acquire precise data on the variations of the vertical distribution of seawater properties, bottom pressures, and sea ice draft at the same scientifically important sites within the BG system and will be retrieved in 2020.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The full-day event will take place on Sunday, March 17, immediately preceding and in conjunction with the 13th Association of Computing Machinery International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI), to be held in Tempe, Arizona.  Launched in 2007, the annual TEI conference is about creating compelling experiences that bridge bits and atoms through research in human-computer interaction, design, interactive arts, tools and technologies. TEI brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on physical/digital interaction design and technological innovation. The intimate size of this single-track conference (about 250 participants in recent years) provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances. The theme of this year's conference is Hybrid Materials in light of the fact that over the past few years TEI research has increasingly embraced hybridity, whether through material explorations of composites such as bioelectronic, on-body, or active materials, or theoretical inquiries into socio-technical systems as hybrid assemblies.  <br/><br/>The 2019 TEI  Graduate Student Consortium will immediately precede the conference, with follow-up activities during the conference's main technical program. Students will present their early stage research to their peers and the faculty mentors, who will constructively critique the students' work from diverse viewpoints. The students will also get to show their work in posters at the conference, and their short papers will be included in the conference proceedings. The day will end with general discussion, reflection, and career advice. The organizing committee has made a special effort to recruit a diverse set of student participants, particularly seeking persons with disabilities and members of underrepresented groups, or at institutions not historically represented at the TEI conferences.  The GSC will sharpen the research skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape human-centered computing as it takes place in physical things and places. Already we are observing the impact of this field in our daily lives, as computing becomes embedded in our phones, our bus stops, and soon even our clothing. Now is a critical moment in the field, as a wave of early exploratory prototypes gives way to disciplined investigations, the development of toolkits, and more rigorous evaluation methods. Mentoring the next generation of TEI researchers is crucial if the field is to retain its vigor and openness in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project intends to address this need by educating scientists  and  mathematicians with computational skills needed to use large datasets to solve complex problems.  Over five years, this project will provide four-year scholarships to fifteen low-income, high-achieving STEM undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need.  The selected Scholars will be majors in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, environmental science, mathematics, physics, or statistics and data science.  The project will develop four new courses to help students develop strong computational thinking and data visualization skills. Three new courses will introduce students early in their college career to interesting scientific problems that require analysis of complex data.  A fourth new course will pair local businesses or non-profit clients with teams of third-year students and their faculty mentors.  The teams will work to solve a client problem that requires computational approaches. Although only some students will receive scholarships, all math and science majors will have access to the new courses and support activities, including a career colloquium, undergraduate research, and a new Math and Science Problem Solving Lab.  This access broadens the potential impact of this work to all STEM undergraduates at the University of Evansville. <br/><br/>The project's research goal is to assess the impact of an interdisciplinary, computation-focused learning community on low-income students.  Data will be collected from formative and summative assessments of Scholars' academic performance, retention in STEM, and progression to STEM careers.

The main theme of the conference is Geometry; one of the cornerstones of modern Mathematics with broad applications, ranging from String Theory to Cryptography.  Through newly discovered, deep connections between various active areas of research in Geometry, including Arithmetic, Algebraic and Complex Differential Geometry, each subject has witnessed unexpected and groundbreaking advances. The conference aims to facilitate interactions among researchers in these diverse fields to further these developments. Such activities have proved to be of unparalleled importance for geometers in these interconnected areas, specially for those in early stages of their careers.<br/><br/><br/>The event supported by this award is composed of a master class (1 week long) and 4 international conferences, each one week long: Singular Metrics in Kaehler Geometry (week 2), Birational Geometry and Hodge Theory (week 3), Entire Curves, Rational Curves and Foliations (week 4), and Ball Quotient Surfaces and Lattices (week 5). The last couple of years have been witness to important progress in our understanding of the geometry of complex algebraic varieties, and more generally Kaehler varieties. The aim of this conference is to facilitate the gathering of experts of international stature in various active areas of research. The aim of the Master Class is  the introduction of techniques and theories that will be used throughout the conference. This will mainly consist of three courses: Hodge theory, K3 surfaces and special metrics on manifolds. During the second week, the goal is to study various geometric problems where the theory of singular metrics play an important role. This includes the following topics: Singular Kaehler-Einstein varieties and their moduli, Positivity in Complex Geometry and Generalized Yau-Tian-Donaldson Conjecture. The aim of the third week is to investigate various methods in Algebraic Geometry with a view towards applications in Birational Geometry and Moduli spaces. The following  topics will be of particular importance: Hodge theory and Moduli of higher dimensional varieties. The goal of the fourth week is to gather specialists in different fields working on the geometry of algebraic and transcendental curves in complex varieties. Topics include: jet spaces and foliations, Special Varieties and Nevanlinna theory. Despite an intensive search for finding a geometric construction for ball quotient surfaces, very few examples have been obtained with explicit equations. Recently Cartwright and Steger have introduced new algorithms for such constructions, leading to the completion of the classification of fake projective planes. The focus of the final week will be a detailed analysis of this fundamental work and its applications.

There is evidence that the number of symbols in the written form of a sound can influence how long that sound is produced, even when a written form is not explicitly present. For example, the final /k/ sounds in the English words ""tic"", ""click"", and ""clique"" are represented by 1, 2, and 3 letters, respectively. When people produce these words, the final /k/ of ""click"" is produced longer than than the final /k/ of ""tic"". And the final /k/ of ""clique"" is produced longer still. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that as the complexity of a written form increases, so too does the speech duration of the associated sound, all else being equal. This phenomenon is inconsistent with some models of language production which argue that written information should not influence speech, especially when written information is not explicitly present. Additionally, it remains unclear exactly which types of written information can influence speech duration as there is disagreement about the mechanisms that drive this effect. Some argue the relationship between sounds and written symbols underlie this effect. Others argue the amount of visual information itself regardless of any connection to sounds is driving these duration differences. This study examines the relationship between sounds, symbols, and speech duration to develop our understanding of what types of written information can alter speech patterns. Addressing this question will inform theoretical models of human speech production. Additionally, data collected through this research can be incorporated into computational speech synthesis and speech recognition systems for more accurate, robust, and natural models of human speech. <br/><br/>A challenge of previous research in this area was that it relied upon natural speech data which includes many external factors across individuals that can influence speech duration outside of written forms (e.g. word frequency). To gain greater control of these variables, the current study will employ a three-day novel-word-learning experiment in which participants learn sets of novel non-word homophones along with one of several novel writing systems. Novel homophones in a set are learned as the same word phonologically but are written distinctly. Written complexity for homophones may vary by: a) number of whole characters; b) number of pen strokes; c) number of components with phonological associations; d) number of components without phonological associations. Participants will produce learned words in a picture-naming task without written forms explicitly present. Participants' production will be recorded and speech duration will be measured. Duration among homophones in a set and across writing systems will be compared to determine: a) if increased written complexity influences duration even when written forms are not explicitly present; b) which types of written information may influence duration and whether written complexity must have a phonological association to influence speech; and c) at which point in the training process speech patterns change and whether these patterns persist through the end of the experimental period. This data will comprise a portion of the doctoral dissertation. An earlier portion of the dissertation investigated similar durational phenomenon in Japanese speakers in regards to written character complexity. To remain consistent with previous data set, retain the ability to compare results from the current study with earlier data in the dissertation, and provide the opportunity to replicate previous findings in the current study, participants for the current study will be native Japanese speakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diversity, equity, and inclusion is a topic area that RAE recognizes as not receiving enough attention or resources within this sector but that is critically important for the effectiveness and sustainability of coastal science and application for management, conservation, and restoration efforts. In order to achieve success in these efforts, environmental institutions must be able to effectively communicate and engage with coastal communities and to attract new talent to the coastal workforce. Both of these endeavors will benefit from intentional actions that serve to identify and eliminate implicit bias within recruitment, retention, and promotion of new staff and in developing an inclusive work environment in which professionals from diverse backgrounds feel welcome. Among the ways that diversity in the workforce can have a positive impact on productivity and success are through competitive advantages, innovation, and new knowledge, skills, and perspectives involving the use and management of natural resources.<br/><br/>RAE proposes to conduct a DEI workshop during its National Summit. The workshop will focus on adding a DEI lens to recruitment and hiring in the coastal sector, including tips to cast a wider net in recruitment efforts, mitigate bias in hiring, and support retention and advancement in an inclusive work environment. The workshop will help participants grapple with bias through three lenses: 1) individual bias that manifests in our personal thoughts and interactions; 2) institutional bias that pervades agency and organizational practices and policies (and in particular, recruitment and hiring), and 3) bias that impacts the entire environmental sector based on the history and legacy of conservation and environmentalist.

In response to the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense, the Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Research 4 Social Change REU project is actively engaging ten undergraduate students each summer for nine-weeks in solving real-world problems of national relevance, teaching them to not only be critical thinkers, but to be creative and reflective as well. The REU project is preparing the future scientific workforce to use advanced CI resources, thus building capacity in research areas that support major advances in understanding across a broad range of societal challenges. Students have a strong desire to have an impact in their communities, a strong desire to have a sense of belonging, and a strong desire to be materially part of something larger than themselves. Connecting social change principals to real-world problem solving is key to long-term success for recruiting and retaining underrepresented communities to computational fields and for preparing students to leverage the national CI.<br/> <br/>The REU aims to meet three objectives: (1) train students to use the national CI by integrating learning of computational science, data-enabled science and multi-disciplinary science in preparation for graduate programs and the workforce; (2) train students to apply advanced computational skills, critical thinking, and creativity to address problems relevant to society; and (3) increase the number of diverse and computationally competent students in the STEM pipeline. The enriching and transformative experience at a world-class supercomputing center includes: training in High Performance Computing (HPC), visualization, and data intensive computing; mentoring by The University of Texas (UT) at Austin researchers; social and team-building activities on the UT Austin campus; professional development and graduate school preparation; and leadership development and opportunities to develop and enhance communication skills. Research projects emphasize advanced computing as a tool to power discoveries that will impact social change for future generations. Using the CI, students conduct cutting-edge research in engineering,  science, and computational medicine: helping automate processes in support of cleaner energy sources for production of biofuel; enhancing research resources for modeling/prediction of porous material properties in fields of petroleum, civil and environmental engineering as well as geology; using data science and visualization to illustrate interfaces between science, traditional culture, and pressing societal problems in the Pacific region; developing and analyzing numerical algorithms for multiphysics, multiscale flow and transport problems in storm surge, tides, and coastal circulation; and developing and analyzing machine learning algorithms for individualized medicine.

Recombination is a major force behind species evolution and genetic variation, and is the basis of nearly all plant and animal breeding. These crucial events are not evenly distributed along chromosomes. In particular, in many plant species with large genomes, including most crops, recombination tends to take place near chromosome ends. In contrast, central portions of chromosomes largely lack recombination, causing a major obstacle to crop breeding. The goal of this project is to better understand how modifying DNA in the cell affects meiotic recombination in crops. Recent advances in understanding recombination suggest that the distribution of recombination events on chromosomes can be altered by reducing DNA methylation, a special, naturally occurring type of modification of DNA molecules. This project will elucidate how exactly DNA methylation affects recombination. It will also examine whether DNA methylation can be artificially controlled during reproduction to change recombination patterns, which will be very useful for plant breeding. Gaining the ability to increase recombination in low-recombination regions of chromosomes will allow breeders to create novel combinations of genes that are located in these regions, and help them produce superior crop varieties. This project is conducted in collaboration with Drs. Chris Franklin and Eugenio Sanchez-Moran at the University of Birmingham, UK, as part of the Breakthrough Technologies to Advance Crop Breeding and Functional Genomics (BTT) initiative.<br/><br/>Recombination is initiated by the formation of numerous programmed double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA, a small proportion of which are processed to form crossovers. Thus, the genetic variation generated by a single round of meiotic recombination is limited. Furthermore, the distribution of crossovers in plants with large genomes, which include most crops, is highly biased towards chromosomes ends. Extensive interstitial and centromere-proximal chromosome regions rarely recombine. Yet, these large genome areas contain roughly one-fifth of the genes in maize and even larger gene fractions in some other crops, which presents a serious impediment to plant breeding. Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation is a critical factor controlling which double-strand breaks become the sites of crossovers, thus shaping crossover landscape. However, the exact relationship between recombination and DNA methylation is not understood. This project seeks to elucidate how DNA methylation affects recombination patterns at the mechanistic level and lay foundations for methods to control crossover landscapes in crops by altering DNA methylation. To elucidate the effect of DNA methylation on meiotic recombination, a protocol to transiently alter DNA methylation patterns in meiosis using DNA methylation inhibitors will be developed. Chemically demethylated plants and selected mutants defective in DNA methylation will be used to determine which steps and processes of meiosis are altered by DNA methylation. The study will be conducted in maize and Brassica rapa, to explore the behavior of both monocot and dicot genomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The circulation of seawater through deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems results in the extensive transformation of both inorganic and organic carbon compounds and may have a significant impact on the deep ocean carbon cycle. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on methane and light hydrocarbons. The distribution and abundance of other types of organic compounds, however, remains poorly known. As a result, the contribution of hydrothermal systems to organic carbon in the deep ocean and the biogeochemical processes responsible for this input, remain highly uncertain. This research conducts a comprehensive study of the composition and abundance of carbon compounds from fluids discharging from two very different, but closely located, hydrothermal vents on the ultraslow spreading mid-Cayman rise in the Caribbean Sea. The two vent sites are located in substantially different host rocks and occur at very different water depths. They also have very different vent fluid temperatures.  Fluids will be collected using multiple, complementary sampling systems and analyzed by various mass spectrometric and other analytical techniques. Comparison between these two sites allows carbon fluxes and chemical transformations to be determined over a range of physical and chemical conditions. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art geochemical methods and provide them with an opportunity to gain experience and training in sea-going research in a strongly interdisciplinary subject. A graduate and several undergraduate students from the University of South Carolina, an EPSCoR state (i.e., a state that does not receive significant federal dollars); Bridgewater State University, which serves economically disadvantaged communities in Massachusetts; and the University of Colorado at Boulder will be involved in the research and play key roles in both the scientific cruise and supporting laboratory activities.<br/><br/>In ocean crust, extensive transformations occur to the carbon compounds present in both the fluids and solids on and below the seafloor due to processes such as heating, precipitation of minerals, injections of magma, and the activity of microorganisms. These processes have consequences for global elemental cycling in the present day and over geologic time. To date, most reports of organic compounds in deep-sea hydrothermal fluids have focused on small, volatile organic molecules such as methane. However, the abundance and fate of other types of organic compounds remains poorly known. To better understand these transformations and the amount of carbon in seafloor hydrothermal systems and their potential impact on deep sea microbes and ecology, samples of hydrothermal fluids emanating from two compositionally and thermally different seafloor vent systems on the mid-Cayman rise (Piccard and von Damm) will be collected on a 16-day oceanographic cruise using a robotic vehicle. Samples will be analyzed for their carbon content and carbon compounds using mass spectrometric and other analytical tools. Goals of the project are to addresses issues such as: (1) the relative contribution of abiotic synthesis, thermal alteration of biomass, fluid-rock interaction, and microbial activity to the inventory of carbon compounds in ridge-crest hydrothermal fluids, (2) how host rock, style of venting, and temperature influence the generation and stability of reduced carbon compounds in axial hot-springs, (3) the fate of seawater-derived dissolved organic carbon during circulation through the oceanic lithosphere, and (4) which organic compounds and signatures are the best geochemical indicators of fluid reaction history. Three different sampling devices will be employed to ensure the full range of carbon containing compounds is captured. Collected samples will be analyzed for bulk characteristics (dissolved organic carbon concentrations and isotopes) and for the composition and isotope characteristics of individual compounds, ranging from volatile (e.g. methane and light hydrocarbons) to non-volatile (e.g. fatty acids), and from labile (e.g. amino acids) to refractory (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). These data will permit the calculation of carbon and isotope mass balances at each location. From this, a comparison of the fate of carbon in both systems will be carried out to evaluate the importance of rock type, temperature, and style of venting on the carbon-bearing compounds present in seafloor hydrothermal vents. Additional measurements will be made with non-targeted, broad spectrum organic compound analyses to identify alteration trends and carbon compound evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called ""G protein-coupled receptors"" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The slow progress on addressing these challenges has led to increasing emphasis on the need to go beyond the study and encouragement of incremental change. Conventional knowledge and capacity building to tackle the challenges associated with sustainability have had limited positive impacts; consequently, there is growing need for more fundamental knowledge on how transformations in the way societies interact both with each other and with the natural environment.  Societal transformations refer to profound and enduring systemic changes that typically involve social, cultural, technological, political, economic and environmental processes. A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability and catalyze new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 19-country initiative through the Belmont Forum- NORFACE-ISSC.  Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research.  Co-production of knowledge and research problem formulation is considered to be critical to the process of societal transformation and each project engages stakeholders or community-based partners.  The initiative seeks to develop the fundamental knowledge societies require to help develop transformations to sustainability which are of significant social concern throughout the world and of great relevance to both academics and stakeholders.  The T2S program aims to build capacity, overcome fragmentation and have a lasting impact on both society and the research landscape by cultivating durable research collaboration across multiple borders, disciplinary boundaries, and with practitioners and societal partners. This includes facilitating the development of new research collaborations with parts of the world which are not often involved in large-scale international research efforts, notably low- and middle-income countries.  The funds provided in this award will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>This project seeks to integrate comprehensive insights on migration into theories of transformation to sustainability. Both domestic and international migration has enormous transformative potential for individuals, societies and landscapes. Transformation theories assume static populations and fail to recognize both positive and negative impacts of the movement of people on societies and ecosystems.  The objective is to expand knowledge of transformations to sustainability and develop a comprehensive migration-sustainability model, and develop insights on sustainability strategies at local, national and international scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Building on theories of small scale turbulence along with established spatial analytical methods from geography and the spatial sciences, this research will develop the spatial sampling strategies needed for efficient and effective sampling of scaler variables in the ABL and develop analytical methods for uncovering the processes impacting weather development. Specifically, this research will (1) determine the optimal sampling scales for thermodynamic variables captured with sUAS in the ABL using variogram analysis; (2) investigate the universality of parameters commonly used to identify the size and shape of turbulent structures across a variety of landscape types and atmospheric conditions; (3) share real time data and research findings with meteorologists at the NWS Tulsa office to aid in forecasting and numerical weather prediction.

In particular, the use of solar, wind, and biomass technologies to provide electricity both on and off national grids is escalating worldwide. Energy access and use is not just a technological issue but also a social one, creating opportunities and risks related to connection and production. While there has been significant research on the social effects of carbon-based energy production and use, we know less about the specific ways alternative forms of energy transform peoples' lives, create new opportunities or risk, and affect relationships between individuals and communities. Understanding how alternative forms of energy are perceived and used at the household level, especially by those who may not have access to traditional forms of electrification, is a crucial part of assessing whether and how alternative energy sources can contribute to a more comprehensive and secure portfolio of energy options. Findings from this research will illuminate the ways alternative energy technologies are incorporated into daily life and to what effect, and will inform national and international energy policies that can be targeted toward meeting the needs of the most marginalized members of society. The project also provides training for students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis; broadens participation in the sciences through the training of students and researchers from underrepresented groups; and it improves scientific infrastructure through international scientific collaboration.<br/><br/>Dr. Kristin Phillips of Emory University and Dr. Erin Dean of the New College of Florida will explore the question of whether the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of new energy technologies are socioeconomically differentiated. This research will examine the impact of solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies on the everyday lives of people in the East African nation of Tanzania. Tanzania is a particularly appropriate place for such a study because the state's pursuit of traditional carbon energy development has been coupled with a notable rise in alternative, renewable energy investment by public and private sources. It provides an appropriate laboratory for investigating energy consumption at the household level, where 90% of energy consumption takes place). The researchers have each worked for over a decade in Tanzania, and their in-country research background is geographically diverse, providing the opportunity to consider different approaches to energy use in rural, urban, peri-urban, and island contexts. Because the existing literature tends to overlook the role of women in energy production and consumption, gendered energy labor and use is an important focus of this research. With gender and geographic range in mind, the core of the research for this project will be conducted through critical case studies in domestic settings in three diverse sites. The researchers will use purposive sampling to identify socioeconomically diverse households who are using a range of energy technologies. Using the methods of observation, interviews, and focus groups, they will investigate the socioeconomic dimensions of renewable energy development. The researchers will also conduct interviews with energy experts, advocates, suppliers, policymakers, investors, and technicians in the public and private sector. Findings from the project will make important contributions to scientific discussions about the optimization of energy extraction, theories of inequality, and debates about infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, DR programs can incentivize price-responsive customers to consume more electric energy when supply is abundant and less when supply is scarce, hence increasing the customers' ability to opportunistically consume wind and solar energy and relieve sources of grid stress. However, two main challenges of balancing demand and supply in the grid under such scenarios is the unpredictability of renewable energy outputs, as well as the need to know customers' price response behavior, i.e., how they change their electricity consumption patterns given different prices. Such information is not available to electricity retailers and cannot be easily solicited from the customers either. The goal of this project is to advance scientific knowledge on the design of DR mechanisms that operate in the absence of reliable generation forecasts and customer price response models. To demonstrate the value of our proposed algorithms for a specific type of price responsive electricity demand, we will highlight the application of our methods for electric vehicle smart charging in public parking lots and fast charging stations. The proposed CAREER plan integrates research with teaching and training activities that provide exposure to exciting opportunities in power systems engineering to students at University of California - Santa Barbara, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our outreach efforts will introduce smart grid concepts to local middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is to build on algorithmic techniques for online learning and control of stochastic systems with unknown parameters in order to generate novel systematic tools for demand response and retail market operation in the presence of high levels of uncertainty. Due to the direct involvement of humans in the DR control loop and high levels of renewable integration, a principal challenge we now face is how we can optimize system operations and dispatch resources in the absence of: 1) algebraic models of the system, e.g., due to unknown price response of customers; 2) a characterization of the uncertainty faced by the system in the future, e.g., due to renewables. We will develop real-time dispatch and pricing solutions that provide optimality guarantees in the face of uncertainty about users demand flexibility as well as grid conditions. Our proposed learning and optimization techniques will be integrated with grid reliability and cyber-security constraints. Furthermore, to study the practical impact of this proposal for an important application, we study online learning and dispatch methods for the mobility-aware real-time electric vehicle (EV) demand management problem, which suffers from both of the challenges highlighted above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viscous streaming is a phenomenon where an oscillating body generates stable, predictable and robust fluid flows that can be used to manipulate the body's local surroundings. Viscous streaming is being proposed for transport, mixing, and particle assembly, and it may be suitable for transport of mini-bots intended for applications in biomedicine. One limitation is that while streaming phenomena are well understood for simple bodies, little is known in the case of complex geometries. This proposal combines modeling and experiments to tackle the knowledge gap that relates viscous streaming to body shape. This knowledge will connect biology and robotics to enhance current capabilities of mini-bots and enables new ones. This research will pave the way to transformative applications such as localized drug delivery, precision manipulation, and fabrication. This is in line with the national need to increase medicine effectiveness as well as competitiveness in manufacturing via advanced computational methods. The proposed research has broad educational impact at the cross-section of fluid mechanics, simulations, robotics, and bioengineering. A set of outreach activities and intuitive learning modules will be designed to spark interest in fluid mechanics and engineering. A broad and diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students from different disciplines will be engaged. <br/><br/>This proposed research delineates a roadmap to understand streaming beyond classic cases.

Key events in Earth history, including the rise of life and the creation of continents, took place during this time, yet fundamental questions remain unanswered.  Did the early Earth exhibit the familiar patterns of continental drift as we see today?  When did the first oxygen-producing organisms evolve?  Did a global magnetic field similar to that of the present-day isolate the atmosphere from loss to the solar wind?  This project will use a new generation magnetic field imaging device, recently developed from advances in quantum sensing, to examine the magnetic properties of rock samples between 2.7 and 4.2 billion years in age.  These experiments are expected to yield new insights into the initiation of plate tectonics, the evolution of the early atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen-producing life.  In parallel with these measurements this project will develop a series of lessons with Boston-area middle school teachers involving student-led observations of the sun through solar telescopes distributed to the schools.  These observations will serve as an introduction to changes in the sun's properties through time and its impact on surface conditions on the early Earth.<br/><br/>The fundamental challenge to understanding conditions on Earth during the Archean Eon (4.0-2.5 billion years ago, or Ga) is the lack of well-preserved rocks dating from that time.  Consequently, attempts to recover information about ancient magnetic fields have been severely hampered by pervasive remagnetization through metamorphism and chemical alteration of ferromagnetic phases.  This project will apply a recently developed technology for micrometer-scale magnetic imaging, known as the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), to address major outstanding questions in Archean Earth history.  The high spatial resolution of the QDM permits direct imaging of remanent magnetization carriers in complex, altered rocks, which aids the identification of primary paleomagnetic signals.  In Task 1, the QDM will be used to infer the existence of the geodynamo before 3.5 Ga by recovering magnetic signals from a newly discovered population of 3.3-4.2 Ga zircons from the Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) of South Africa.  As part of Task 2, the project team will apply both QDM and traditional paleomagnetic techniques on carefully selected igneous rock units to quantify the mobility of lithospheric plate at 3.45 Ga.  Finally, Task 3 of the project will use the QDM to infer the origin of ferromagnetic iron oxides preserved in 2.78 Ga micrometeorites, thereby testing the controversial hypothesis that the upper atmosphere of the Earth was oxygen-rich several hundred million years before the Great Oxidation Event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers will build laboratory scale deltas subject to controlled environmental conditions that will interact with a newly developed marsh proxy that mimics key marsh properties at a reduced scale. These experiments will help reveal how river deltas and marshes interact over hundred to thousand year timescales under simple conditions, and provide insight into the land loss and subsidence problems that are currently affecting the Mississippi and other global river deltas. The project will broadcast experiments into K-12 classrooms in Louisiana, train a diverse group of researchers at University of Arkansas and Tulane University, and translate results into articles designed for public consumption through social media platforms.<br/><br/>The researchers will study how river deltas and marshes interact using physical laboratory experiments that will incorporate a novel marsh proxy. This marsh proxy will be added to deltaic experiments following a rule-based model of sedimentation based on the local elevation of the evolving deposit. For the first time, this will allow them to document how the internal dynamics of deltas are augmented by marshes that cover vast swaths of many delta plains. Through comparison to prior experiments that evolved in the absence of marshes, they will isolate surface dynamics, compactional subsidence patterns, and stratigraphic products of marsh-delta coupling. Quantitative theory developed in this study will aid prediction of marsh and deltas sustainability in the coming decades and enhance ability to interpret their strata for paleo-environmental records.  Research will be conducted by a diverse team (in gender, ethnicity, and career stage) including undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to K-12 students. This project is jointly funded by the Geomorphology and Land-Use Dynamics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The growing prospect of machine learning approaches such as deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) being used in CPSs (e.g., self-driving cars) has raised concerns around safety and robustness of autonomous agents. Recent work on generating adversarial attacks have shown that it is computationally feasible for a bad actor to fool a deep learning (DL) model dramatically. Apart from adversarial attacks, such DL models can also succumb to the so-called 'edge-cases' where the real-life operational situation presents data that are not well-represented in the training data set. Such cases have been the primary reason for quite a few self-driving car accidents recently. Although initial research has begun to address scenarios with specific attack models, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding detection and adaptation of ML models to 'edge-cases' and adversarial attacks in the context of CPS.<br/><br/>With this motivation, this project builds a meta-learning-based supervisory framework and associated algorithms to detect and mitigate ML system vulnerabilities which will substantially reduce the risk in using ML for safety and time-critical systems. The science driver applications are self-driving cars and robotics. The algorithm validation and evaluation use experimental self-driving cars and robotics test beds at Iowa State in collaboration with the Institution of Transportation and NVIDIA.<br/><br/>Research is integrated with education to support the goal of training students in the critical interdisciplinary area of system theory and data science, which is in dire need of rapid and quality workforce development for sustained economic and social growth of the United States. Education plans also include curriculum development at graduate and undergraduate level, undergraduate research experience, academic competitions and outreach activities involving both high school students and teachers. Outcomes of this project will support NSF's mission of ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" for many critical CPSs that currently involve ML or will involve it in future, such as manufacturing processes, power grid, smart cities and transportation systems, to make them safer, more efficient and cost effective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emotions result from making evaluations about the world while considering our future goals, past experiences, and current states. For example, humans have a basic need to connect with others, and emotions such as guilt can provide signals that help guide our behavior to meet these broader social goals by minimizing the negative impact of our actions on others. However, these internal experiences can currently only be subjectively assessed via introspection, which has limited our ability to understand how our brain generates these unique feelings and the overall consistency of these experiences across individuals. Through a series of studies, we will: (a) elicit feelings of guilt in participants tasked with making choices to reduce another person's suffering; (b) develop objective measures of these guilt experiences using computational models of facial expressions and brain activity; and (c) evaluate how these guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes such as perceiving guilt in others, remembering past experiences of guilt, and making decisions to harm others. This work has important implications for a number of consequential, emotional, and costly decisions that might impact others in a multitude of domains such as healthcare, politics, and business.<br/><br/>This proposal leverages computational techniques to identify objective measures of guilt experiences using brain patterns and facial expressions. In Aim 1, we will elucidate how guilt-aversion is a central motivation in making decisions to minimize harm to others and can be objectively measured by modelling patterns of brain activity. In Aim 2, we use these objective measures to better understand how guilt experiences relate to other types of psychological processes (perceiving, remembering, and imagining guilt). In Aim 3, we will examine if brain signals are uniquely able to capture signatures of guilt, or if these experiences can also be measured using patterns of facial expressions. This work provides a unique interdisciplinary approach to improve our understanding of guilt. First, we demonstrate our ability to successfully elicit guilt using a naturalistic social interaction and identify a common representation in a pattern of brain activity. This will allow us to perform construct validation on this measure to characterize how the experience of guilt relates to other related psychological experiences such as observing others in pain, recalling a previous guilty experience, or making decisions to harm others. Third, this proposal will evaluate whether guilt is uniquely encoded in brain signals, or if it might be manifested in other downstream signals such as patterns of facial expressions. If successful, this work might have a transformative impact on the field of emotion by overcoming the limitations of self-report in studying emotional experiences. This proposal can also provide important insight into evaluating the utility of alternative low-cost measurements to neuroimaging in capturing psychological experiences via facial expressions. Finally, this work could have implications for decision-making more broadly; our preferences for minimizing guilt may be so strong that they overwhelm the other costs associated with decision outcomes.  This proposal also incorporates synergistic educational training and outreach to broaden the work, including a new intensive summer training program; outreach to community service organizations; and new curriculum for undergraduate and medical students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The major characteristics include deficits in social, sensory, and emotional processing. Boys have about four times higher rate of diagnosis than girls. General interventions such as behavior and speech/language therapies have been developed, and socially assistive robots have shown effective and positive outcomes in communicating with and delivering interactive interventions to individuals with ASD.  However, a major obstacle to broadening the impact of robotic assistance and intervention in real-world settings is the lack of a robotic framework that can adaptively learn diverse interaction skills over time and associate with new social contexts as the human counterpart develops. Furthermore, recent studies are showing that girls are under-diagnosed and thus under-served due to their higher sensitivity in social cues resulting in social camouflage that often causes their symptoms to go undetected. Thus, there is a demonstrated need for intelligent socially-assistive robotic systems that can cope with the developmental processes and gender-specific characteristics of children with ASD. To address this need, the project aims to develop a novel socio-emotional human-robot interaction framework to provide interactive emotional regulation and guidance through robot-initiated conversation and gestures in response to the individual's unique socio-emotional cues.  These cues can be recognized through analysis of voice signals, facial expressions, gestures and conversation. The successfully developed framework, which will be implemented on virtual and physical robotic platforms, will promote healthier and emotionally-balanced living for individuals with socio-emotional processing disorders or deficits. The knowledge gained through this project will be directly fused into educational activities for the future generation and students from underrepresented groups to develop creative mindsets and analytic skills in science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM). Collaborative outreach activities include: applying the technology developed in the George Washington Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute (ANDI) facility; working with the Kennedy Krieger Institute through Robotic Design workshops, Summer Robotics camps and providing Robotic interactions in school environments; and participating in the Take2 Summer Camp program that offers a 4-week therapeutic camp for children who have difficultly functioning in the social world.<br/><br/>The PI's long-term career research goal is to understand the fundamental principles of human interactions and behaviors and translate these mechanisms into computational modeling and algorithms for a novel assistive robotic framework.  Toward this goal, this project will develop a socially assistive robotic framework with contextual ambidexterity that is perceptive of personal socio-emotional states, capable of learning social skills, emotionally interactive, and gender-smart for long-term human-robot interaction and intervention (LT-HRI). Contextual ambidexterity, which investigates the key metrics for synchronizing two strategies--how to best exploit given functionality and resources in performing a task and how to efficiently explore new skills and knowledge to gain social intelligence over time--is very applicable to the robotic agent that needs to be able to determine best selections from programmed skills (exploitation) when faced with well-perceived situations but needs to also be able to learn new skills and contexts (exploration) when faced with unknown situations.  To evaluate the efficacy of the framework in the real world, an active learning robotic agent will be developed to assist in socio-emotional LT-HRI for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The Research Plan is organized under four tasks.  The FIRST TASK is to achieve advanced emotional perception tailored to an individual's unique socio-emotional cues.  A voice-based-emotion-estimation module will be developed and combined with a widely used facial expression analysis module to control an interactive communication module that can interact with the user to acquire more accurate emotional characteristics if needed.  The SECOND TASK is to learn social gestures and contexts from personal interactions and communications. Algorithms have been developed to capture the real-time sequence of a human gesture and to generate ""gesture-features"" that will be passed to a module that will check to see if the feature is already learned or, if not, will be registered as a new gesture.  Once the gesture is learned, the robot will practice the learned behavior and observe the user's response to learn/update the social context of the gesture. The THIRD TASK is to develop an efficient framework for modeling emotional interaction and regulation between a human user and a robotic agent and to develop controllable algorithms for effective rapport formation.  Emotional agents include human emotion, robotic emotion and a target emotional goal for emotional regulation and therapy.  In the ""rapport forming"" phase, the robot's emotional goal is designed to approach the human's emotional goal and establish a common bond of empathy.  In the ""emotional guidance"" phase, if the ""rapport phase"" is failing, the robot will take a proactive role in moving the human's emotional state toward the target emotion.  The FOURTH TASK is to develop a gender-smart robotic intervention system, i.e., an optimal interaction policy for gender-specific social environments. Once the robot has perceived the user's emotional state, the robot can select subsequent actions to increase the user's engagement/participation level.  Gender-smart behavior planning will be based on Partial Observable Markov Decision Process(POMDP) models of each user's interaction patterns/preferences, which can be used to maximize the total expected reward and determine the next action to be taken by the robot.  POMDP models results can be incorporated into gender-specific representations (e.g. heatmaps) that can be used to anticipate gender differences. A set of experiments with human participants (neurotypical adolescents and adolescents with ASD, ages 10-19) will be designed to validate algorithms and assess the overall effectiveness of the robotic framework. The specifications, training data, and algorithm outcomes produced by the project will be openly disseminated for researchers as open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) packages and repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions. Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent),the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture (for which Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Bianchi, elliptic, Jacobi, Hilbert, and Siegel modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.

All these systems face similar decision-making challenges due to uncertainty, complex state-spaces, combinatorial constraints, and strategic agent behavior. The aim of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to develop a unified framework for real-time decision-making for smart systems, built around the use of data-driven prediction oracles and non-monetary market mechanisms. Such an approach leads to policies that are simple, easy to interpret and implement in practice; understanding their performance however requires new theoretical and methodological ideas. The research will be complemented by collaborations with partners in on-demand transportation, cloud computing, online payment processing and the local food-bank, which will provide a portfolio of examples for pedagogical purposes. These collaborations tie in with outreach plans, which center on the development of a public library of societal systems simulators. These will provide research projects for undergraduate students, experiential problems for courses, and public demonstrations for attracting K-12 students to STEM fields. <br/><br/>From a technical perspective, this research will develop rigorous frameworks for: (i) harnessing prediction oracles as inputs to real-time control policies, and (ii) designing non-monetary allocation policies based on emulating monetary mechanism. An exemplar of the paradigm is the idea of simulation-as-a-service (SaaS), wherein complex data-driven simulators will be used as inputs for control policies and mechanisms. Such an approach leverages historical and real-time data, incorporates the unique constraints of the underlying system, and results in simple and practical policies. The cost of this simplicity is that it is harder to prove rigorous guarantees. To overcome this, the research will couple advances in machine learning and mechanism design theory with the underlying philosophy of model-predictive control. In particular, new theoretical techniques, using ideas from stochastic coupling, convex optimization, martingale duality, and measure concentration, will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since these algorithms are being developed at a time when AI can determine matters ranging from bank loan eligibility to criminal sentencing, there is a growing call for AI decision-making transparency. This project asks how mental health technology companies in the US and Japan (two major, interconnected centers of AI development) are addressing this concern, and how that impacts the ways in which they use AI to provide care. Research will take place at three AI companies (two in the U.S. and one in Japan) in the understudied startup technology sector. Data collection includes interviews and participant observation with innovators and investors, psychological service leads, and engineers and developers. Data will be analyzed to ascertain what objectives, ethical and practical considerations, and relationships inform the mental health care algorithms. This ethnographic investigation aims to further scientific understanding of how different configurations of and approaches to AI make possible an array of different (and sometimes clashing) objectives, strategies, and core beliefs about what constitutes optimal ways of caring for mental health. The project will advance theoretical understanding at the intersections of anthropology, psychology, and STS around datafication in health care and how mental care, as experienced across different cultural terrains, is translated into algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these evolutionary histories is fascinating, but more importantly, is a crucial precursor to many biological analyses. Some evolutionary relationships are obvious (e.g., a cat is closer to a lion than a chicken) but other consequential relationships are hard to discern. Luckily, evolution operates on the genomes of organisms, and the sequence of genetic changes leaves a trace of the evolutionary histories. Following these traces and reconstructing the evolutionary past, however, is a computational problem, and as it turns out, is a difficult problem. Sophisticated methods are needed to infer a phylogeny: a tree, called tree-of-life, that shows the historical relationships between species. When sequencing whole genomes became possible in the mid-2000s, many believed the sheer amount of data would result in robust reconstructions of phylogenies. While genome sequencing has fulfilled some of its promises, other challenges remain. Large-scale data are hard to adequately model and are hard to screen for errors. As a result, different analyses do not always agree, and also, inference algorithms are pushed to their limits of scalability. Thus, an improved understanding of the tree-of-life requires not just more data but also better algorithms. Interestingly, as data sciences permeate many areas of science, issues of robustness to error and scalability faced in phylogenetics will confront many disciplines. Thus, the next generation of data scientists needs to be trained to consider these concerns when developing algorithms for data analysis.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address current limitations in phylogenomics (phylogeny inference from whole genomes) and to integrate issues of robustness and scalability into teaching. The main challenge in phylogenomics is data heterogeneity, and there are two sources of data heterogeneity: real biological processes driving genome evolution that lead to discordant histories across the genome, and artefactual heterogeneity that results from complex pipelines used to prepare the data for inference. Models of real heterogeneity exist. However, current methods often require knowing the source of heterogeneity in advance, are often not scalable, are not always robust to artefactual heterogeneity. The approach taken here is to combine unsupervised learning and discrete optimization to build methods for identifying errors. These techniques will strive to minimize assumptions and will use both parametric and non-parametric statistics. The project will draw on machine learning, multi-criteria optimization, and high-performance computing. If successful, it will dramatically improve the accuracy and scalability of genome-wide phylogeny reconstruction and will help researchers understand intricate patterns in genome evolution. To integrate research and education, this project will enable yearly hackathons that bring together students with computational and biological expertise with the goal of developing robust and scalable methods. The project will also seek to improve the understanding of data science for undergrad and K-12 students, emphasizing for them both the excitement and challenges of analyzing large error-prone datasets. The tools developed here will be publicly available and well-documented. Yearly workshops will be held to help biologists learn and use the tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the most exciting advancements in our understanding of the universe can come from joint observations of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals, as was evident from the detection of merging neutron stars in August of 2017 by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations as well as electromagnetic telescopes around the world.  This project will enable prompt follow-up of detected gravitational-wave signals with electromagnetic telescopes by increasing the speed and accuracy with which gravitational-wave data from the LIGO detectors can be calibrated and disseminated to astrophysical analyses.  In addition to enabling the advancements in science that will be obtained from prompt multi-messenger astronomy, this project will also shepherd the next generation of scientists into this exciting field.  The project funds the development and expansion of a Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group that serves as a no-barrier-to-entry research opportunity for high school and early-career undergraduate students at Kenyon College and in the surrounding community.  This group has already launched several undergraduates into LIGO-related research projects, and this project will allow that pipeline to expand and improve access to a wide range of students.<br/><br/>The first step in gravitational-wave data analysis is the accurate and prompt reconstruction, or calibration, of the detector strain h(t). Currently the calibrated strain data is available to quick-response gravitational-wave searches in approximately 10 seconds with minimal information about the quality of the detector data. This project will propel LIGO data production into the future with very low-latency calibrated strain data, subtraction of noise in the calibrated strain data, and robust information about the quality of the strain data. This transformed data product would then be at the fingertips of quick-response gravitational-wave searches, thereby improving the ability of these searches to both find and quantify gravitational waves in the data.  The project incorporates undergraduates and high school students into this cutting-edge field.  Undergraduate students will be involved in implementing low-latency methods for removing noise from the strain data and using machine learning algorithms to provide predictions about the probability of loud, transient noise events being present in the data.  High school students and early undergraduate students will be initiated into the fields of astronomy and gravitational-wave physics through the Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group at Kenyon College.  ROAR students will perform astronomy observations and pulsar candidate identification that will contribute to the field of pulsar timing.  This program thereby establishes a research pipeline through which students can engage early in research opportunities and transition into advanced research areas.  The ROAR program brings scientific research and education opportunities to high school students in a rural area who would otherwise have little exposure to modern scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electron has another property, its spin (i.e., rotational momentum). In most magnetic materials these spins are neatly arranged on a repeating pattern of atomic nuclei. In ferromagnets, the kind of magnets that decorate fridges, all these spins are aligned in the same direction, making the material magnetic with a well-defined north and south pole. The research team works on exotic magnets with atomic nuclei arranged in triangular patterns in which the spins cannot make up their minds about where to point. This allows the system to not adopt just one state but rather fluctuate between many available states. The ""spin flips"" associated with these fluctuations can be regarded as particles that have only a single magnetic pole. One of the major themes of this project is to investigate whether these spin flips can be used as information carriers in future generations of information technology, such as quantum computing. The research team synthesizes these exotic magnets in thin film form at Florida State University and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). By straining the thin film material the principal investigator tweaks the atomic positions, and the magnetic properties, which are studied using state-of-the-art facilities at the NHMFL and at national laboratories. This work is paramount in paving the way to a future in which devices based on exotic magnetic materials make use of spins, rather than charges, as information carriers. These research goals are integrated with undergraduate level curriculum development in materials synthesis to provide students at Florida State University with an education that will prepare them for the emerging advanced materials workforce. Outreach efforts include public lectures and middle school classroom activities that aim to increase (materials) science capital within the community. With these activities the principal investigator works to increase science awareness and interest in students and to empower them to make more informed decisions about their future career paths. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>This project seeks to study ground state selection, emergent properties, and concomitant exotic excitations in geometrically frustrated systems as they are exposed to degeneracy breaking perturbations.  Strong spin/lattice coupling is expected to lead to emergent ground states in structurally engineered films and heterostructures of frustrated antiferromagnets. The initial focus is on pyrochlore titanates, geometrically frustrated systems in which the Ising anisotropy leads to formation of a spin ice state showing only short range correlations. The spin ice state has been shown to host topological excitations that behave like magnetic monopoles. There is an enticing potential of harnessing topological excitations, such as monopoles, as novel types of information carriers. The project is aimed at characterizing how the spin ice physics, and the formation and dynamics of the monopoles, respond to external perturbations such as epitaxial strain. Furthermore, the application of strain in thin film samples unavoidably leads to a reduction in dimensionality, and the effect of such confinement on spin ice physics, which is predicted to be significant, is being investigated. Spin ice physics is also observed in spinel vanadates, poster materials for orbital physics in frustrated antiferromagnets. The PI utilizes epitaxial strain to tune noncollinear spin textures and stabilize a d-electron analogue of the spin ice state on the pyrochlore V sublattice in spinel vanadate thin films. The general approach for activities associated with this project can be described as, 1) systematic synthesis and structural characterization of strained thin films of frustrated antiferromagnets, 2) characterization of the magnetic properties, and associated noncollinear spin textures, using capacitive torque magnetometry measurements and elastic neutron scattering studies, and 3) development of the torque technique to include the ability to probe spin flip dynamics in spinel and pyrochlore thin films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These improvements will enhance comfort and reliability when used by individuals with disorders within the autism spectrum. The benefits of these improvements will advance the effectiveness of treatments for emotion regulation and behavioral interventions.  There is a growing interest in complementing such behavioral clinical treatments with various low-cost and easy-to-access technology-based tools to improve therapy efficacy. However, it was shown that training through existing technology-based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) intervention tools does not usually generalize to real-life activities for many reasons. The investigator will develop an intervention for ASD to reinforce emotion regulation strategies based on real-time monitoring and analysis. Specifically, the planned electroencephalography (EEG)-guided brain-computer interface (BCI) technology could be used to complement all clinical treatments that focus on emotion regulation to decrease clinician time spent with each patient. The novel scientific discoveries and engineering enhancements will have overreaching contributions to develop ASD intervention techniques for (i) decreased depression and anxiety; (ii) decreased problematic behaviors including aggression in social interactions; and (iii) decreased functional impairment across different settings including school, work, home and community. Research and education goals will include: (i) course development; (ii) inclusion of researchers from K-12 to graduate level in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research environment to promote STEM careers; and (iii) establishing new outreach activities to inform the broader public about the proposed research outcomes and the latest technological advancements in research for technology-based ASD intervention.  <br/><br/>The research objective of this specific project is to introduce a framework that will enable EEG-guided closed-loop: (i) monitoring of the brain responses of individuals during technology-based ASD intervention, and (ii) control of the presentation of clinical treatment strategy cues for emotion regulation in individuals with ASD.

These propositions of real-time probabilistic analysis of EEG are unique, and present a potentially game-changing opportunity to advance the generalization effect of existing technology-based ASD intervention for emotion regulation.  This project will also contribute to developing new machine learning algorithms and neuroscience methods to identify EEG features associated with emotion regulation to classify between distress and non-distress conditions, and to distinguish among different distress levels.  The developed models will be based on a solid mathematical framework based on variational autoencoders and Bayesian optimal statistical inference, information theoretic measures of feature selection for efficient learning, and computationally efficient optimization of modular and submodular monotonic or non-monotonic functions.  Optimization algorithms will provide computationally efficient solutions that generate(sub)optimal feature selection strategies with performance guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeology is well-placed to answer these questions due to its deep temporal view, allowing researchers to trace long-term changes in both human society and the environment. This project will explore the ways in which humans interact with their environments by examining the varied usages of birds by prehistoric peoples in the Aleutian Islands. Throughout history, humans have used birds in a variety of ways, from food, to raw materials for tools, to clothing. In addition to their more practical usages, birds often play a significant role in Indigenous cultural systems, making them valuable indicators of the ways in which human society is shaped by the environment in which they live. However, due to poor preservation and excavation bias bird remains have only recently begun to be studied in depth. The archaeological sites of the Aleutian Islands have very large avian bone assemblages due to excellent taphonomic conditions. The large size and excellent preservation of these assemblages allows rigorous study from which we can study not only local relationships with birds but also develop models for other times and places.<br/><br/>This project will compare the patterns of skeletal bird remains found at archaeological sites in the Rat Islands to oral histories and ethnographies to reveal the interplay of the symbolic and 'material' aspects of the relationship between birds and the residents of the Aleutian Islands. The relationship between the prehistoric inhabitants of the Rat Islands, the Unangan, and birds was maintained by a suite of continual and often daily practices, from hunting, to storytelling, to subsistence. The resulting artifacts of these day-to-day activities, in this case the avian bone assemblage, play a significant role in the reproduction of social and cultural values. By studying the technological choices that the Unangan made regarding birds we can begin to examine the more social and symbolic aspects of the Unangan-bird relationship. Patterns will be examined over a 4000-year time span allowing for an examination of the impact of climatic events on bird exploitation by the Unangan. This project will examine how material practices are shaped by the culture in which they developed and, in turn, by the environment in which they were created. The project team will generate new methodologies for examining how bird remains are deposited by humans within archaeological sites which will allow for not only a better understanding of the interplay between humans and environment in the Aleutians, but which will be applicable to archaeological sites globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many practical applications, especially in biology and medicine, data-driven reasoning has been based on probabilistic graphical models, that are preferred because of the accuracy in data representation and ease of interpretation. In probabilistic graphical modeling, the modeled objects, for example, the attributes of a patient stored in electronic health records, are represented as random variables, and the goal is to learn dependencies between these variables. However, the methods to learn high-quality probabilistic graphical models from the data are computationally challenging, and do not scale to datasets emerging in modern applications. Therefore, this project aims to enable high-quality probabilistic graphical modeling of large datasets by using high performance computing techniques. To this end, the project introduces a framework of fundamental operations underlying probabilistic graphical modeling, including for managing data and coordinating computations, together with their software fulfillment, that can efficiently leverage large-scale parallel computers. The framework is designed to benefit both practitioners interested in the analysis of large-scale data, and researchers interested in the development of new learning algorithms. The validation and evaluation of the framework is based on the analysis of electronic health records with the goal of early prognosis and diagnosis of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - problems vital for improving quality and reducing the cost of healthcare. Furthermore, the framework provides the foundation to train the next generation of biomedical professionals in the use of data analytics on advanced cyberinfrastructure. Thus, the project is aligned with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science, and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>This project responds to the recognized and growing demand for scalable machine learning methods that could capitalize on parallel architectures such as large clusters of multi-core processors. The research focus is on exact structure learning of probabilistic graphical models, for example Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, in the context of biomedical data analytics. The project is based on the two main components: a new high performance abstraction for managing data in machine learning applications, including memory efficient strategies for answering counting queries on multi-core processors, and a new programming model for distributed memory systems to facilitate efficient exploration of large-scale combinatorial search spaces, such as those described by tress, lattices or graphs. These abstractions are used to realize a set of new parallel, exact algorithms for structure search, and the related problems, for example Markov blankets identification, that accelerate learning by exploiting various properties of the input data and the underlying search spaces. The research component is driven by the timely and socially relevant application in personalized and preventive medicine, enabled by a massive collection of the actual electronic health records. The project aims to delivers multiple artifacts, including MPI and OpenMP-based software, benchmark data and educational materials, all released as open source for use, further development, enhancement, and incorporation by the community. The research activities are tightly coupled with multiple educational efforts, spanning development of an interdisciplinary course for medical professionals to train them in the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure, engagement of undergraduate students and underrepresented minorities in research, and outreach to middle and high school students to attract them to STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both flow and jamming can create problems - clogging within a production line can be catastrophic, and flow from a rockslide can cause a state of emergency. Additionally many other systems are particulate in nature, such as cars and blood cells, and insights from the study of granular materials can give us insight into solving problems like traffic and blood clots. Part of the issue is that granular materials are difficult to image, and there is interesting physics happening at a wide range of time and length scales. This project will study the flow and jamming of granular materials with extremely fast video capture and high-definition resolution. The particles themselves are made of material that can appear to light up when they experience force. Thus the research team can not only detect the motion of every particle in the system, they can also measure the force on each individual particle. The acquisition and analysis of this data is critical for a more complete understanding of granular materials. The project is highly integrated with the broader educational goals of training future scientists and increasing science literacy in the public. Specifically, the principal investigator will provide training and mentorship to women undergraduate students involved in the research, and the project will support the training and mentorship of a postdoctoral researcher. The principal investigator will facilitate an immersive pre-college program for underrepresented groups interested in the physical sciences and engineering. Lastly, the principal investigator will continue to support and grow a monthly public science lecture series. <br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>The overarching objective of this project is to advance the understanding of the dynamics of granular material flow and jamming with state-of-the-art time and spatial resolution, in addition to grain-scale force measurements. The long-term goal is to understand the structural and dynamical signatures at the mesoscale that control the clogging and flow of granular materials. The research team performs this work in the context of one particular flow geometry, though the methods are transferrable to other granular systems. In this system, the flowing state has been found to be described by the empirical Beverloo equation, but a sound theoretical footing for this behavior has not been established. Theoretical models of granular materials often use a continuum approach or a microscale ""bottom-up"" approach. However, it has become exceedingly clear that the behavior of granular materials depends on multiple length scales, and a functional predictive model must take various mesoscales into account. There has also been recent interest in the transition from flow to clogging in this system, and whether it is similar to (or different from) the jamming or glass transitions. This work will directly probe the nature of the clogging transition, and will contribute to forming better theoretical models of granular flow. The research team directly measures the microscopic particle motions, and mesoscale features such as the force network and rearranging clusters of particles, all with extremely high time and spatial resolution. The force network is measured by the use of photoelastic grains. In addition to experiments, the research team performs complementary molecular dynamics simulations for comparison. The data is analyzed for mesoscale features such as cooperative rearrangments, shear transformation zones, and particle segregation, and the initial packing structure of the system is modified as a control parameter. Network analysis techniques such as community detection algorithms are used to further analyze the evolution of the contact and force networks during flow and clogging events. In tandem, the research team is building a public library of collective motion metrics and documenting their use in disparate fields, with the goal of spawning more efficient implementation and cross-disciplinary collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That feat will be replicated by this project through the development of both artificial neurons and synapses on the same materials platform.  This will allow us to create systems that can emulate the capacity and speed of the human brain for pattern matching, beating current systems that are bulkier, slower and more power hungry. This will revolutionize the field of machine learning and create devices where the machine-learning hardware is close to the sensor, giving rise to systems that are currently impossible to create. Neuromorphic circuits based on these devices include smart wearables that can monitor health biometrics and issue first level triage for elderly people alone at home. They can improve autonomous driving for terrestrial vehicles. These circuits will be especially useful for spacecrafts and space rovers because these ultra-light circuits will not be a bottleneck to the rocket's payload. Fast pattern recognition abilities through these deep neural networks will enhance speech recognition in portable electronics and improve traffic analysis and control systems. In collaboration with Central Florida STEM Alliance (CFSA) program, underrepresented minorities from local community colleges will be provided hands-on research opportunities in the lab of the PI. Regular video lab tours to underrepresented K-12 students and week-long lab experience for two selected K-12 students annually will foster their interest in STEM education.

In these heterostructures graphene acts as the electrodes and MoS2 as the switching medium. Volatile resistive switching observed in vertically-standing sheets of MoS2 will be harnessed to realize integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons, and the stochastic nature of their firing will be investigated. Artificial synapses with sub-picojoules of energy requirement per switching event will be developed using the multi-level non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets. The mechanisms behind this intriguing phenomenon of volatile resistive switching in vertical MoS2 sheets versus non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets will be investigated using electrical and materials characterization techniques. The necessity of graphene electrodes in the heterostructure will be justified. Through engineering of the heterostructure design, the performance of the artificial neurons and synapses will be optimized to create stochastic resistive-switching IF neurons and low-power synapses which will be integrated monolithically. The advantage of mechanical flexibility of graphene and MoS2 will be exploited to fabricate and test these neuromorphic devices on a flexible platform. The proposed research program aims at bringing together two emerging research areas cohesively into a cutting edge technology. While 2D materials have immense prospects in succeeding silicon within the von Neumann paradigm, non-von Neumann approaches have always dealt with conventional materials. This transformative research would bring together the best of both these worlds. The use of large-area 2D materials will enhance the practical realization of these exotic devices. Ultra-low power operation of graphene/MoS2/graphene artificial synapses with sparse firing graphene/MoS2/graphene artificial neurons will provide for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All of this previous work, however, is incomplete because they require humans to make the final decisions about any changes and they are reactionary measures that fix problems after they occur. What is needed for a truly ""self-driving"" DBMS is a new software architecture that is explicitly designed for autonomous operation. With this, the DBMS will remove the need for humans to oversee and maintain the software. It also enables new optimizations that are important for modern high-performance DBMSs, but which are not possible today because the complexity of managing these systems has surpassed the abilities of human experts. Such a system will remove the human capital impediments of deploying databases and allow organizations in all facets of society (e.g., business, science, government) to more easily derive the benefits of data-driven decision-making applications. The techniques developed as part of this research are also applicable to other problem domains where autonomous operation could improve a software system's performance and efficiency, including both larger systems (e.g., distributed DBMSs, data centers) and smaller devices (e.g., mobile devices, IoT sensors).<br/><br/>This project investigates techniques for self-driving DBMSs that combines state-of-the-art methods from database systems, machine learning (ML), and control theory. Achieving autonomous operation in a DBMS is now possible due to algorithmic advancements in ML, as well as improvements to storage and computation hardware. What makes this different than earlier attempts is that all aspects of the system are controlled by an integrated planning component that not only optimizes the system for the current workload but also predicts future workload trends before they occur so that the system can prepare itself accordingly. This work will produce on-line methods for discovering relevant optimization actions based on these workload forecast models, thereby enabling the planning component to converge to a better configuration with less training data. In addition to this, this research will study how to deploy these actions without hindering the DBMS's performance (e.g., downtime due to restarts) or causing incorrect behavior. The outcome will be a set of first principles for efficient self-driving DBMS architectures that can deploy these modifications and provide the necessary feedback for their integrated models. Such principles are timely in identifying issues that inhibit automation of existing systems and influencing the design of future DBMS architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new approach can evaluate the orientations and crystallinity of systems which cannot be studied with conventional tools, enabling deeper understanding of important processes in chemistry, food science, catalysis, environmental science, forensics, and biology.  The team is also generating educational materials to communicate the concepts and relevance of its research activities through a series of workshops offering hands-on and project-based activities. A diverse group of students is engaged in the conception and execution of the workshops, with an aim of inspiring participants (including women and underrepresented minority students) to pursue careers in STEM. <br/><br/>Living systems and their components, such as nucleic and amino acids, can present complex structural arrangements, such as chirality.

Dr. Tetard is developing and evaluating a new approach to nanoscale polarized infrared spectroscopy to enable identification of molecular chirality in complex systems, and to further establish means to monitor specific dynamic structure-activity relationships associated with these systems.  The approach utilizes light polarization and field enhancement for nanomechanical AFM detection. The performance of the platform is being tested on several molecules of importance in life sciences. Additional efforts target time-resolved monitoring of changes in molecular twists.

The perception of time is fundamental to our conscious experience and critical to virtually all of our activities.  However, despite being a focus of research in experimental psychology since the 19th century, time perception is still incompletely understood. Previous work has suggested that the brain controls the timing of our actions and the motor system simply produces an output in response to these timed brain commands. That is, the brain decides when to move and the motor system produces the movement. However, recent research has shown that the motor system may have a much more critical role in timing and may be fundamentally necessary for the perception of time. The investigators will test this idea by having human participants move a robotic arm that can be perturbed by the experimenters. The investigators will explore whether changing the features of the robotic arm movement also alters the subject's perception of time and whether this paradigm can be used to improve the perception of time. The research program combines aspects of the decision-making and motor planning literatures and will provide novel training for graduate and undergraduate students in the two research areas. Finally, understanding timing and movements is critical to the development of brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthetics and may help support interventions in motor rehabilitation and motor disorders. <br/><br/>In most psychological research on time perception in humans, subjects must typically make a choice between two alternatives by pressing a button. This stands in contrast to most animal research, where animals must move to a response location. The investigators intend to bridge the gap between these two literatures with the proposed paradigm. To do this, subjects will be required to move a robotic arm to different locations, depending on their decision about an elapsed interval of time. A series of studies will test the effects of 1) adding resistance to the arm while subjects actively time an interval, 2) actively moving vs. planning a movement while timing an interval, and 3) the impact of moving while judging other, time-critical stimuli (e.g., pitch). In all studies, the investigators will use movement kinematics and dynamics to predict the choices subjects will make and will apply drift-diffusion modeling simulations to elucidate where and how movement parameters impact the perception of time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This exploratory project will assess the effectiveness of a Logic Programming (LP) approach to integrate computing into middle school science education. Researching LP as a strategy to integrate computing into STEM offers an interesting and viable approach for the STEM+C field. While LP is not a new programming approach, it is under-explored in the STEM+C field where the focus is more on visually-based programming such as block-based programming (e.g., Scratch). Through logic programming, students will learn to represent STEM subject-matter knowledge in an explicit and precise manner, while practicing critical thinking and logical reasoning, and developing computer models based on scientific investigation and problem-solving. A key advantage of LP is in its simplicity and generalizability, and this project will provide valuable information about its effectiveness for STEM content area curriculum development.  <br/><br/>Employing a design-based research methodology, the research team will first develop, test and implement 6-week modules that integrate computing with chemistry and life science using logic programming.  This curriculum will facilitate students in developing skills fundamental to computing (e.g., abstraction in knowledge representation) and STEM, and compliant with standards such as Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Science (TEKS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  A mixed-methods approach will be employed to study the effectiveness of the LP approach on students' motivation and learning outcomes in both computing and the STEM content areas.

According to all known physical laws, there should be equal amounts of matter and anti-matter in existence. However, scientists have not found any large clumps of anti-matter such as anti-stars or anti-planets.  One way to explain this asymmetry may involve new particles and forces that are not described by the Standard Model of particle physics. The hypothesized forces could violate some fundamental symmetries such as Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), or Time reversal (T) symmetry in order to explain the matter to anti-matter asymmetry in the universe.  But these same forces would cause other ""forbidden"" interactions between electrons, nucleons and electromagnetic fields, which may be detected by sensitive laboratory experiments.  These effects are significantly amplified in polar molecules due to their very large internal electromagnetic fields.  Searching for these effects with modern, quantum techniques enables ""tabletop"" searches for evidence of new particles and forces.  This can promote the progress of science by opening up new, unexplored areas of fundamental physics.<br/><br/>This project will search for a nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) in polyatomic 173YbOH molecules.  The MQM is a CP-violating electromagnetic moment that can exist in nuclei with spin I>1/2, and is enhanced in quadrupole deformed nuclei such as 173Yb.  The MQM would arise from sources such as CP-violating nuclear forces, quark EDMs, and more, making it a sensitive probe for many hadronic sources beyond the Standard Model.  Polyatomic molecules are a powerful platform for precision measurement since they generically enable full polarization and internal co-magnetometer states without interfering with laser cooling.  This is a combination of features not available in other systems.

These reactions are valuable for forming carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and other types of bonds for the construction of complex organic molecules for use in drug design, the design of new biomaterials, and other advanced manufacturing applications. In cross coupling reactions the control of reaction selectivity is often challenging. If the catalyst cannot differentiate between several possible reaction sites on the molecules, a mixture of products will result. Purification of that mixture increases cost and waste. In this project, Dr. Neufeldt is developing catalysts for cross coupling that efficiently differentiate between similar reactive sites. Both laboratory-based and computational studies are being employed to understand how the  catalyst structure influences the way the catalyst interacts with subtly different sites. This information is being used to design improved catalysts to achieve higher selectivity and efficiency. As part of this project, Dr. Neufeldt is involved in activities to encourage participation of underrepresented minorities in scientific research and improve computational chemistry education at the undergraduate level. These activities include involving students from neighboring tribal colleges in computational chemistry research, implementing computational chemistry labs into the organic curriculum at Montana State University, and engaging in outreach to local schools and tribal colleges. <br/><br/>Dr. Neufeldt is identifying and exploiting new mechanisms by which phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands can influence site selectivity in nickel (Ni)- and palladium (Pd)-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.

In addition, NHC ligands are under investigation for their ability to influence selectivity between aryl triflates and chlorides in Pd-catalyzed couplings. The origin of selectivity in these systems is examined through a combination of experimental and computational studies. Density functional theory is also employed to design new site-selective catalysts on the computer. The work in this project is valuable for improving the functional group tolerance of cross couplings, facilitating sequential or iterative couplings, and providing insight into catalyst structure-selectivity relationships.

The US Gulf Coast region is especially vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes, sea level rise, land subsidence, and flooding. Some parishes in Louisiana have lost over 90% of their land, largely due to environmental changes. What socioeconomic and cultural factors influence perceptions of environment risk and migration? This project investigates factors not traditionally associated with the environment, including ties to place, strong social relationships, and counter perceptions of environmental risk, that might keep people in place, despite environmental risk. Migration theory suggests that behavior is largely linked to economic factors, such as income opportunities or life ambitions. This research, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis, will investigate whether, and to what extent, environmental perceptions impact movement decisions. Improved understanding of movement decisions can inform local and state decision makers, yielding more precise composite descriptions of their constituents and likely behavioral outcomes, enabling better prediction of migration patterns and strategic planning. Environmental perceptions are also of value to the emergency and first-response communities when they confront new environmental dangers. The ability to better communicate environmental risk or danger can ultimately help to save lives.<br/><br/>Charlotte Till, under the supervision of Dr. Shauna BurnSilver of Arizona State University, will explore the relationship between risk perceptions and migration decisions. This research will be conducted in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, an ideal setting for studying risk where there are both acute and chronic stressors on movement behavior. Hurricanes pose a severe seasonal threat to this area, but sea level rise and land subsidence represent cumulative risks and a new everyday reality for coastal people. During pilot study work in the area in 2016 the researchers found that relative to younger residents, older residents had less intention to leave despite known risks, and factors such as home, family, or community were important features of the environment. Based on survey and interview methodologies this research will first identify how the environment is perceived, and then investigate the influence of these perceptions on movement decisions. Survey responses will form the baseline data representing local perceptions, and then a subset of respondents will be invited to interviews allowing the investigator to explore movement logic(s) and the significance of identified influence factors for their decision making. Text analysis tools will be used to analyze interview data. Examples of the insights possible through the findings of this work include: how movement decisions are made, what factors result in place attachment outweighing risk, and how environmental factors interact with movement decisions. By actively incorporating individuals who do not move, this project is targeting an understudied but critical group for analyzing human movement patterns. By drawing participants directly from the parish this research may spur greater public engagement with science, contributing toward greater public scientific literacy. This research contributes to development of the migration literature on the role of the environment in movement decisions and factors impacting those decisions. This project will also facilitate improved understanding and engagement among communities, emergency managers, and municipal respresentatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inability to meet future food demands places more pressure on the one billion individuals currently underfed and living in substandard conditions throughout the world. These limitations will manifest into amplified social pressures such as, but not limited to, increased rates of disease, demand for land and water resources, and a lack of agricultural entrepreneurship, which only further weakens the global economy. A sustainable method (i.e., practical and economical) for remediating agricultural waste, while producing high value protein is essential to the long-term health of ecosystems and agriculture. One solution is the utilization of insect farming to convert organic wastes, which will potentially produce alternate resources of monetary value for the farmer. Insect farming can produce enormous amounts of protein and lipids that can be used in a variety of commodity settings (e.g., feed production, compost, biofuels, human food in some cases).  Additionally, this production of alternative protein sources is less environmentally straining than most currently used methods in terms of reduced arable land, water usage and reduced emissions.<br/><br/>The Center for Environmental Sustainability through Insect Farming (CESTIns) will be comprised of three sites (Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis [IUPUI], Texas A&M AgriLife Research [TAMU], and Mississippi State University [MSU]), with each site specializing in a specific area of research.  The IUPUI site will be focused on the genetics and genomics of the insect systems, evaluating the heritability of traits, a determination of the genetic contribution to traits, protein and other nutrients' extraction methods, and the public's perception and attitudes towards insects as food and feed.  IUPUI will work with the other sites to integrate research thrusts across the three sites with MSU and TAMU focusing on insect biology, microbiology, and engineering and feed trials. Through this research, new knowledge and technologies that fill critical scientific and industrial gaps that relate to the insect farming as related to livestock and aquaculture production. Further, all three sites will work with strains produced by Industry as well as strains developed internally as a means to optimize mass production. Laboratory and field-based experiments will also engage interdisciplinary expertise in microbiology, engineering, chemistry, food science, physiology, and vertebrate biology with cutting edge technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Revolutionary fluorescent biosensing probes have been engineered for the live-cell imaging of proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.  The outcome of this project will provide ground-breaking methodologies in the field of live-cell imaging of small molecules.  The proposed project will allow researchers from the life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences to measure cellular levels and dynamics of a wide range of analytes with readily accessible sensors.  This project will also integrate sensor engineering research with scientific education and outreach.  <br/><br/>In this project, a new generalized sensor system is developed by integrating emerging fluorogenic RNA aptamers, a systematic evolution approach, and natural RNA machineries with nucleic acid nanotechnology.  Fluorogenic RNA aptamers, such as so-called ""Spinach"" and ""Broccoli"",  serve as the genetically encoded fluorescent reporters.  Systematic evolution is used to screen for aptamers that can selectively bind with target small molecules inside live cells.  Finally, RNA devices and circuits existing in nature or enabled by nanotechnology provides signal amplification as well as scaffolds for the ratiometric and multiplexed imaging and quantification of target analytes.  The major research objectives are: (1) to develop quantitative RNA sensors with multiplexing ability for the cellular imaging of small-molecule levels; (2) to engineer sensitive and robust RNA circuits and devices for detecting low-abundance analytes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; and (3) to generate a high-throughput screening platform to rapidly evolve functional RNA sensors directly in a cellular milieu.  Overall, RNA-based fluorescent probes will be radically advanced through this project for quantitative imaging of a wide range of small-molecule analytes in living cells. Dr. You is an active faculty participant in the Eureka! Program of Girls Inc. of Holyoke, and will continue to provide summer research opportunities for female middle school students in this program.  The You research team will also provide lab tours for local middle school students and teachers.  In addition, this project provides training opportunities for the next-generation of U.S. trained scientists.

Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications.	<br/><br/>This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, metrics will value the services and goods offered from organizations in times of normal operation and crisis. Drawing on the fields of systems and structural engineering, urban planning, and sociology, an interdisciplinary community-based model will be developed and employed to assess and assign the highest priority to buildings and organizations that support sustained health and welfare in communities to drastically reduce disaster impacts, disruption, and recovery time following future hazard events. Education and outreach tasks overcome systematic barriers to interdisciplinary research through training the next generation of disaster scholars and structural engineers to value cross-disciplinary contributions and approaches, understand their social and ethical responsibility in enhancing community resilience to disasters, and engage in life-long learning. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be better designed buildings, which will save lives, economic losses, and reduce panic, anger and confusion during disasters.<br/><br/>This CAREER project asks: (1) how do buildings and their hosted organizations act as a system to support the functioning of a community, (2) what characteristics of buildings and their organizations can be leveraged for prioritization in the design stage to better support continued community functioning in the wake of a disaster, and (3) what constitutes acceptable levels of functionality for buildings, organizations, and communities? To answer these questions, existing work and databases are coupled with new data collection to advance system analysis of buildings and organizations accounting for changes across a disaster timeline and uncertainty. New measures for understanding how buildings support community functionality are grounded on the seven community capitals, namely, built, social, cultural, political, financial, natural, and human. Fault tree analysis, multi-attribute utility theory, and hazard simulation coupled with sensitivity analysis are used to recommend a replacement for the risk category that sets the highest priority of structural performance on buildings that host organizations and offer services that critically support community functionality.

Various PQC schemes have been proposed for standardization, whose mathematical soundness are under investigation. Unfortunately, even a mathematically sound cryptography scheme may be attacked at the implementation level. The primary research goal of this project is to develop secure implementations for lattice-based cryptosystems, a major class of PQC encryption proposals. This work specifically addresses the fundamental power and electromagnetic side-channel vulnerabilities of physical implementations which may leak information. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is a novel framework that employs instruction set extensions to compose side-channel protected software, which can provide comprehensive side-channel security.  By contrast, research on side-channel analysis of lattice cryptosystems have so far been limited to point solutions that evaluate a single instance. The research tasks are to extract a set of common operations for lattice-based cryptosystems, to build side-channel resistant versions of these arithmetic computations, to use a side-channel aware compiler for re-composing the software with the protected instructions, and to evaluate/benchmark side-channel security and countermeasure overheads.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include disseminating publications, distributing open-source hardware and software, and bridging the research on computer architectures and hardware security. This bridge is critical as secure computer architectures currently exclude physical side-channels in their threat model. This work may also help the ongoing quantum-secure encryption standardization effort led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), by evaluating the submitted lattice cryptography-based proposals. <br/><br/>This project will use a repository with multiple back up servers to store and log the data, and the major results and hardware and software products will be made publicly available by using resources over the world wide web.

In addition, it also serves as an ideal body part for applying brain stimulations. However, most of the existing head-based sensing and stimulation methods are cumbersome, intrusive, and expensive, mostly suitable only for stationary and short-term usages such as in clinics or hospitals. This project aims to fill that gap by enabling a novel form of wearable sensing and actuating systems that can unobtrusively, continuously, comfortably, and simultaneously sense a multitude of head-based physiological signals and actuate to stimulate the brain while remaining minimally visible to the public. While the well-accepted form factors for wearable devices are watches, glasses, and other kinds of body-worn form factors, this work takes a drastically different approach, an ear-worn sensing and actuation approach (called Earable Systems) to tame a problem that has long hindered the deployment of head-based wearable systems, namely user acceptance, by making the wearable devices more socially acceptable and less visible to the public. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the key research activities. The activities include: formulating multiple head-based signal propagation models to and from human ears using superposition principle of wave propagation; developing algorithms, experimental hardware blocks, analytical models, and software libraries for sensing individual head-based physiological signals; developing closed-loop stimulation techniques, associated hardware, analytical tools, and safety guidelines for effective and safe just-in-time brain stimulation from the ears; and evaluating Earable Systems and the proposed platform in-lab for a compelling and practical application. <br/><br/>This project's broader impacts stem from an integrated program of education, research and outreach that will translate the research results into demonstrations and hands-on experiences for under-served middle school students and local teachers through lab visits and summer workshops.

It has been predicted that three major economic areas are related to tribology and lubrication engineering -- energy, manufacturing and transportation. These three areas all follow a trend towards increasing the efficiency, in which lubricants or new lubricant formulations are a critical component in an intense competition to provide goods at the lowest costs. This market pressure will continue to create a demand for new machinery and new type of lubricants that can improve the efficiency of manufacturing operations. <br/><br/>The project builds a bridge that connects research findings in the computational lab to the real industrial world.

So far the nanoscale mechanical behaviors of base oils in boundary lubrication are still not well understood. This project focuses on atomic-scale friction behavior of realistic lubricant oils with/without additives and develops new computational models to provide unique insights into the atomistic behaviors of lubricants under compression and shear in boundary lubrication. Through collaboration with potential industry customers, computational molecular simulations reveal the fundamental lubricant-surface interactions under extreme boundary lubrication conditions. This project creates a new frontier for the advancement in tribology and lubrication engineering while meeting current customer needs.

This project addresses the need to increase public awareness about the importance and significance of geoscience research done by a diverse, dynamic group of researchers, and also addresses the need to attract and retain a more diverse population of young people to the geoscience fields by offering hands-on media training to college students and faculty that will increase their skills in public communication in this increasingly media-oriented world.  The PIs for this project are veteran earth science filmmakers Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, who have produced eighteen successful documentaries for broadcast on PBS and internationally, and many shorter geoscience focused videos, set in locations on every continent.  They have also mentored a number of geoscience students in media production techniques; some of these students have gone on to utilize these skills in professional positions.  In addition to creating a mechanism for developing and producing in a timely fashion both professional broadcast documentaries and student/researcher-produced videos about geoscience research this project will also provide a unique incentive to students from diverse backgrounds to participate in geoscience research projects and field camps/schools, and while in the field receive intensive media training from the PIs.  The trainees will not only have the opportunity to contribute content to a broadcast documentary and their own video production, they will learn a valuable skill in communicating science to the public using advanced production techniques, which will increase their competitiveness as they seek new positions, and ultimately broaden the number and diversity of geologists who can skillfully document important and exciting geoscience research activities and thereby increase the quality and quantity of accurate, credible media products about geoscience topics that raise public awareness of the relevance, importance, and need for geoscience research and knowledge.  Focusing on diversity of gender, ethnicity, and economic background among the students and researchers participating in this project will have the impact of providing participants of differing perspectives with a skill that will permit them to more effectively and creatively apply and express those diverse perspectives in their own work, ultimately increasing the number and diversity of voices that reach the public with the impact of engaging a broader, more diverse audience with authoritative, relevant geoscience information.<br/> <br/>This pilot project addresses the need for earth scientists to communicate more effectively with the public in today's increasingly media-oriented world by developing an efficient mechanism for generating compelling broadcast documentaries and videos about geoscience research and by providing hands-on training in media production to a diverse group of earth science students and researchers.  PIs Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation are veteran earth science filmmakers who have produced eighteen successful documentaries for PBS broadcast, set in locations on all seven continents, as well as many shorter geoscience videos.  As part of their educational mission, on recent film shoots the PIs have begun mentoring geoscience and other students in video production techniques.  The goals of this EAGER are to:  1. Create a mechanism for efficiently documenting relevant new and ongoing research activities being carried out by a diverse group of researchers;  2.

This may have happened to valuable oyster reefs in Northwest Florida in 2012, when drought and low river flow allowed predators of oysters to flourish and consume nearly all the oysters. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and river flow, oysters have not recovered, suggesting the ecosystem may have crossed a tipping point. However, the timing and magnitude of the disturbance from Hurricane Michael (2018) may have pushed the ecosystem back towards its original, healthy state.  In this project, investigators make field observations to gauge how predators and oysters are responding to Hurricane Michael and conduct lab experiments to test how predators and oysters respond to hurricane rainfall conditions. Additionally, they use mathematical models to predict whether effects observed in the field and lab could lead to a shift back past the tipping point. This is a rare opportunity to study how oyster ecosystems can shift back from altered to healthy states. However, a rapid response is essential before seasonal changes in the weather and bay obscure hurricane impacts. This research has several broader impacts. First, it will expand the ecological theory of tipping points. Second, it can support the management of the Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery, such as insight into the likely success of restoration efforts. The team coordinates with the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve to this end. Finally, research outputs are incorporated into ongoing public education and training efforts.<br/><br/><br/>Ecosystems can rapidly shift from their original, high-value state to a new, degraded one. Such shifts have been observed in many ecosystems, but it is sometimes difficult to identify the mechanisms that mediate the shift beyond a ""tipping point"" and - to a greater extent - those that could mediate a shift back to the original state. Improving our understanding and predictive capability of tipping points depends on identifying the mechanisms that underlie bi-directional system shifts. In 2012, the oyster reefs of Apalachicola Bay, FL abruptly shifted into an oyster-less state when prolonged drought and low river flow allowed marine oyster predators to flourish. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and flow, there has not been a return shift, suggesting this ecosystem may have entered an alternate stable state. The hypothesis of this work is that in 2018 Hurricane Michael provided a sufficient disturbance to shift the system back into the attracting basin for its original state (prior observations support this prediction). This project couples field observations and lab experiments with population modeling to test whether and how Hurricane Michael initiated a reversal shift. A rapid response is essential before seasonal variability in this ecosystem obscures hurricane effects. The proposal's intellectual merit is based on its ability to address a central goal in ecology: identifying and predicting ecosystem tipping points. Combining empirical observations and models is a promising approach to advance this goal, but has not been widely applied in the field, mainly because researchers are not in place at the time of a shift. Hurricane Michael provides a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving this goal will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians.  The project will provide scholarships to students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, and/or Physics.   First-year students will receive four-year scholarships and transfer students will receive two-year scholarships.  The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with effective supporting activities.  Planned activities include mentoring, undergraduate research experiences, service learning, outreach projects, graduate school preparation, and participation in discipline-specific conferences. With the help of mentors, the Scholars will create Individual Development Plans that define their career goals and steps toward achieving those goals. The project will also support curriculum improvements aimed at increasing first-year student retention in STEM.  Because Lane College has a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to increase degree completion of low-income, academically high-achieving undergraduates in STEM fields. Non-cognitive, psychosocial factors, such as fixed and growth mindset, grit, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward science, have been demonstrated to affect student persistence in STEM. This project will investigate the effects of psychosocial factors on STEM students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, many of whom face challenges related to college readiness, academic engagement, and scientific identity. This project will examine the possibility that the Scholar selection process is biased toward students who are predisposed to success because of psychosocial factors, such as growth mindset.  It will also investigate the alternative possibility that the Scholars develop certain psychosocial factors associated with academic success as a result of participating in project activities. This project has the potential to advance understanding of how psychosocial factors affect student success in STEM fields, including the success of students from underrepresented groups.

A geothermal battery would store solar generated hot water in the earth, and withdraw it as steam or use it in a hot water binary-cycle electricity generation system when needed, particularly when solar and wind are not available. Solar and wind electricity are being introduced into electric grids to supplement conventional electricity production, driven substantially by a desire to ""decarbonize"" electricity production, and more recently due to falling prices of solar and wind energy. Such introduction has in some ways been ""too successful"" leading to short-term curtailments of some solar and wind production. Also, electricity can be provided by solar and wind only when the sun shines and the wind blows, resulting in fluctuating production of electricity. Meanwhile, the deployment of ""utility scale storage"" (sometimes referred to as ""grid scale"") has not kept pace with this intermittent nature of solar, and to a lesser extent wind. The battery concept would utilize an existing geo-heated reservoir, but one where the reservoir temperature is too low to be economically viable. The addition of heat produced by solar thermal may be able to raise the low-grade geothermal reservoir temperature enough to utilize it efficiently for steam/binary cycle electricity production. To a large extent, this storage concept is all ""renewable energy"" drawing on geothermal energy and solar thermal energy combined. If feasible, the implementation of this storage concept would improve the reliability and extent of solar and wind electricity throughout areas of the nation, resulting in less reliance on carbon-based fuels. <br/><br/>Energy storage that is cost competitive is essential in order to continue the addition of solar and wind electricity without great disruptions. This project focusses on the determination if a Geothermal Battery Energy Storage System is technically feasible at a potentially competitive cost. A steering committee will meet at the start of the project to provide planning guidance, and near the conclusion of the project to provide tentative consensus conclusions. A concluding workshop will be held where findings will be reviewed and consensus conclusions presented. The results of the project will add to the existing knowledge base by exploring technical phenomena related to the Geothermal Battery Energy Storage concept, including thermal energy movement within a geo-reservoir; rock expansion that occurs when heating the reservoir; the chemical effect on the rock due to the cyclic heating and cooling of the reservoir; and the potential for induced seismicity as thermal expansion and the injection of water into the reservoir produce certain fault movements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project asks what coastal citizens value about the American shore in the near future, and how their investments intersect with the long-term goals of ecological restoration science. On the one hand, how do the promises of restoration science affect the way people whose livelihoods depend upon the coast approach their own environmental management practices in the present? On the other hand, what kinds of local histories and epistemological orientations inform the far-future goals of ecological restoration? Situated in southern Louisiana, where state-funded, large-scale infrastructural projects aim to recover lost wetlands and rejuvenate the state's coastal communities, this research will investigate the concept of ecological restoration in Louisiana, asking how the possibility of restoring the Louisiana coast is affecting local expectations of the future environment. <br/><br/>Hannah Burnett, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will explore whether the unprecedented rates of wetland erosion along the Louisiana coast have shaped expectations and behaviors along different temporal scales. In the wake of several largescale disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2010 BP oil spill, Louisiana has proposed to install several river diversions that will re-route sections of the lower Mississippi River, releasing sediment-rich water across eroding wetlands in order to build new land. These infrastructural projects aim to rebuild Louisiana's rapidly eroding coast by mimicking the natural flood events that slowly accumulate into the state's wetlands. The project described here will take place in the coastal communities in southeastern Louisiana that will be most directly affected by these river diversions. By interviewing local fisherpeople and accompanying them in their daily practices, the researchers propose to shed light on the different cycles that fisherpeople rely upon, examining the moments when these cycles are affected by the longer-term goals of wetland restoration. In addition, the researchers will conduct interviews with restoration scientists, along with archival research, to better understand the history of ecological restoration in Louisiana, the metrics that determine progress towards restoration, and the timescales at which scientists project restoration will be achieved. The project will contribute to debates in anthropology, STS, and disaster science more broadly about environmental change, temporality, human behavior, and coastal ecologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the collection and availability of massive data on IPSs, a significant challenge, faced by the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry is the capability to efficiently anticipate and avoid rare but catastrophic failure events. Developing an information structure that enables users to make the best use of massive data and to model the complexity and rarity of critical situations would contribute to addressing this challenge. This project investigates a novel, unsupervised rare-event learning framework for AV research that utilizes the collected data to assess and alleviate the risks, limitations, and failure modes of IPSs. The framework combines the flexibility in modeling high-dimensional time-series driving data via unsupervised learning algorithms, with the statistical robustness and computational efficiency from rare-event analysis. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the research include: 1) formulate an effective framework to extract safety-critical information from driving database; 2) develop a solid probabilistic measurement scheme for rare but adverse events in AV driving contexts; 3) disseminate the framework and research outcomes to industry and government units in urgent need of reliable evaluation and development methods; and 4) cross-fertilize research thrusts between the academic communities of rare-event estimation and the study of IPSs. The research will merge high-fidelity driving representations learned from data and statistically rigorous rare event analysis so that AV design evaluation in simulated complex driving situations will become highly efficient. It will synthesize machine learning with simulation methodologies, including rare-event analysis, stochastic optimization, and particle methods to boost the performances of state-of-the-art algorithms. The project will foster transformative academic cross-fertilization between researchers in rare-event estimation (operations research) and IPSs (machine learning/robotics), by disseminating the outcomes in top-tier journals, conferences, tutorials and invited seminars. The research will train under-represented minority students at the PIs' institutions, provide opportunities to meet key AV academic and industry players, and show them how to apply mathematical and engineering skills to improve transportation mobility, safety, and roadway efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, these models can be vulnerable to attackers trying to infer the sensitive data that was used to build the model.  This raises important research questions about how to develop machine learning models that protect private data against inference attacks while still being accurate and useful predictive models, as well as important practical considerations about how these risks to patient data may expose health care providers to legal action based on HIPAA and related regulations. To address these questions, this project will develop a framework, called PrivateNet, for privacy preservation in deep neural networks under model attacks to offer strong privacy protections for data used in deep learning.  PrivateNet will be developed on top of commonly used machine learning frameworks, providing ways for the project's findings to have impact in both industry and educational contexts.<br/><br/>A key thrust of the project is to better understand and defend against model inference attacks, including both well-known fundamental model attacks and novel attacks developed through prism of the classical confidentiality and integrity models.  Through an extensive analysis of these attacks, the team will develop an understanding of the relative risks of key aspects of learning approaches.  In particular, vulnerable features, parameters, and correlations, which are essential to conduct model attacks, will be automatically identified and protected in a novel threat-aware privacy preserving approach based on ideas from differential privacy.  Specifically, the team will develop adaptive privacy preserving mechanisms that distribute noise across the most vulnerable aspects of the learning process to provide strong differential privacy protections in deep learning models while maintaining high model utility.

These bacteria are part of the gut flora or microbiome, a collection of microorganisms that live in the gut and have an influence on human health. The gut microbiome helps us digest food and fight pathogens, for example.  It takes 1-2 years from birth for babies to develop an adult-like gut flora. The human breast milk delivers molecules that promote or suppress the growth of specific gut bacteria to infants. About two hundred of these molecules are oligosaccharides.  The research of Dr. Townsend focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism by which oligosaccharides found in human breast milk affect the growth and virulence of a bacterium from the gut that is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis.  Successful completion of this project may help us understand human-bacteria communication and provide new strategies to control specific aspects of this communication. The interdisciplinary aspects of this program allows graduate students and undergraduates to gain expertise in modern research techniques.

One of these components are human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs).  The central focus of Dr. Townsend's program is to define how HMOs maintain microbiome homeostasis. Bioassay-guided fractionation is used to identify potent antimicrobial HMOs in human milk. Then, they use chemical synthesis to prepare photoreactive HMO probes. These probes are used in affinity-based protein profiling to discover the specific biological targets of HMOs and gain key insight into the mechanism of action of HMOs. The identification of the mechanistic targets of HMOs may significantly impact basic science by annotating, at the molecular level, the biochemical processes of HMO-based chemical signaling between humans and microbes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, passenger pigeons were once abundant throughout North America, but no longer exist. We often know about the factors that cause a widespread species to decline (in the case of the passenger pigeon, the original cause was hunting), but we know much less about what causes some populations to recover, and others not to do so, once that original cause of declines is gone. Monarch butterfly populations have declined dramatically in North America, and now western populations may be approaching extinction. In the 1980?s, millions of monarch butterflies overwintered on the California coast, and bred during the summer west of the Rocky Mountains. By the 2000?s, the overwintering population had declined to ~200,000-300,000 butterflies. In 2018, the population dropped to ~30,000 butterflies. This RAPID project will use the unexpected, rapid decline of western monarch butterflies to test theories of extinction risk. We will evaluate what changes in this suddenly-small population, through a combination of carefully controlled experiments and sightings reported by volunteers looking for monarch butterflies throughout the west, especially in California. We will use this knowledge to help guide management and recovery of this iconic butterfly population.<br/><br/>The research will test the hypothesis that vital rates, like survival and reproduction, decline as populations become very small, perhaps because individual animals have difficulty finding mates, or cannot protect themselves from predators as well as they could in groups. If very small populations decline due to these ""Allee effects"", there is a fleeting window of time in which to study population dynamics before local population extinction. Because we know so little about suddenly-small populations, ecologists typically base conservation plans on predicting declines to a ?quasi-extinction threshold?, in other words, a population size below which the species is unlikely to be able to recover. Based upon estimates of survival on overwintering grounds and reproduction in early spring, earlier work warned that 30,000 butterflies may be a quasi-extinction threshold for western monarchs. This project will (1) Test whether winter survival and spring reproduction are now lower than they were in the past; (2) Calculate rates of summer range expansion, and compare 2019 to years in the recent past, to evaluate potential reductions of survival, reproduction, or movement at other life stages; (3) Combine results of (1) & (2) with existing data to model dynamics of this migratory population through its full annual cycle. This model will be used to calculate annual population growth rates in small and large populations, and also to evaluate the potential of different management strategies to help western monarch butterflies recover from quasi-extinction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it has proven extremely difficult to fabricate such structures using traditional manufacturing techniques, partially because their intricate structures need to be developed over many length scales. To address this challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project will investigate a freeze nano printing (FNP) approach through selectively freezing and in situ ice-templating of nanomaterials to fabricate multiscale, multifunctional porous structures. A combined experimental and modeling methodology will be used to understand the fundamental mechanism in FNP and elucidate the parameter-process-structure-property relations. The research will contribute a 3D printing process that can fundamentally unlock structural and functional properties and lead to industrial applications in areas such as energy, health, environment, aerospace, automotive, and consumer products.  As such, the project positively impacts economic welfare, national health and security. The educational objective is to inspire high school students, attract freshman-level undergraduate students to the field, train graduate students, and provide outreach to the general public through hands-on education and manufacturing innovation based on 3D printing technologies. Activities include publishing an open-source 3D printing system; development of web-accessible lectures; and organization of a TINKER camp workshop, a Liberty Partnerships program, and a 3D printing symposium. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will focus on freeze nano printing (FNP) technology to fabricate multiscale and multifunctional porous structures. The central premise is that the microscale structure can be manipulated by in situ ice-templating, while the macroscale structure can be controlled by inkjet printing. If successful, this project will significantly advance scientific understanding of the complex phenomena in FNP process, including 1) understanding how the high-aspect-ratio multidimensional nanomaterials interact with printing nozzle, and how the ink composition and process parameters affect the drop formation, and ultimately influence the property of the produced macrostructure, 2) elucidating the mechanism of how the multidimensional nanomaterials interact with ice-crystals during the droplet-wise ice-templating process, and how the complex behavior affects the microstructural property, and 3) studying the relation between the process parameters and the interfacial structures of the multiple materials, and how the interfacial structures influence the multifunctionality. Through hands-on-based educational activities, this project will provide exciting course materials and lab projects to students from K-12 to graduate-level. Outreach to pre-college institutes with curriculum relevant to students' daily lives will broaden participation of the minority and underrepresented groups. Curriculum tailored to the undergraduate and graduate students through teaching and research will inspire their lifelong interest in science and engineering. Community outreach will help promote awareness and adoption of 3D printing technologies and democratize advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cryptocurrencies offer the promise of increased efficiency and decreasing frictions in the financial system, such as international money transfer fees and costs associated with raising investment capital. Unfortunately, they are also misused as a payment mechanism for illicit activities such as extortion, drugs, human trafficking, and cybercrime. These illicit activities have likely diminished the reputation of these cryptocurrencies and facilitated large amounts of harm for entities and individual people. Improved forensic tools  that can potentially de-anonymize illicit transactions or capture valuable semantic information about a transaction (for example, what was purchased in a particular transaction), could reduce both of these negative effects. This project will conduct open research that will improve our understanding of how to devise improved cryptocurrency forensic techniques that can be adopted by researchers, companies, and investigators. Much of the research into advanced cryptocurrency forensic techniques is currently being performed by companies and integrated into their closed platforms. This has resulted in a lack of public, generalizable understanding of how to detect and understand the illicit activities occurring within these cryptocurrency ecosystems. The advanced cryptocurrency forensics tools developed in this project will be open and enable improved detection of illicit cryptocurrency transactions. This project will also provide students with expertise in financial technology, security, and machine learning which are all areas of broad national needs.<br/><br/>Achieving the goal of improving the efficacy of cryptocurrency forensics tools requires progress on several key challenges.  These include: (1) Designing and implementing improved and open cryptocurrency forensic data collection and archiving systems. (2) Investigating cryptocurrency address labeling techniques. (3) Designing algorithms for improved clustering of addresses and flow tracing. The approach proposed in this project is unique in that it blends improvements to data collection and archiving with advanced machine learning-based algorithms. The project will deepen the understanding of how to effectively perform forensics of a broad range of cryptocurrencies. The ability to effectively forensically analyze cryptocurrencies fundamentally affects our ability to understand and mitigate illicit activities that impact many United States citizens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

National identity cards use biometrics to identify individuals. In many applications, a large group of users' biometrics are stored together in a centralized database.  This type of widespread and expanding use of biometrics creates privacy concerns as biometrics are correlated to sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and disease risk factors. Protecting this data balances needs and citizens' privacy.  This project designs a new system that allows identification while retaining privacy of non-relevant individuals when querying centralized biometric databases.  The system design uses cryptography to provide rigorous security claims.<br/><br/>Searchable encryption allows a database to process queries without knowing the underlying data.  Current biometrics are characterized by noise between repeated readings. This project designs two systems which both build on searchable encryption and noise tolerant cryptography.  The first system combines selective locality sensitive hashes and searchable encryption to retrieve records that match many locality sensitive hash outputs.  The second system builds a variant of inner-product encryption that retrieves only the set of close records.  The superior of the two designs will be implemented and benchmarked.  An important aspect of any searchable encryption design is its leakage profile.  As such, the implemented scheme's leakage is evaluated with respect to the known statistical properties of an identified biometric.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metamaterials are artificially assembled materials-structures designed to have mechanical properties that are not naturally available. The research aims at developing a novel class of metamaterials which break the transmission symmetry of incident dynamic loads, thereby forcing mechanical excitations to travel differently in opposing directions along the same channel. The study of non-reciprocal structures enables a realization of mechanical systems which are analogous to electronic components, such as rectifiers, switches, and logic elements that have eluded the mechanical domain for decades. New functionalities provided by such metamaterials will propel new applications in vibration isolation and suppression in engine mounts, turbine blades, and other aerospace and civil infrastructures. Reflection-immune metamaterials are also envisioned to have a lasting impact on medical imaging and photoacoustic tomography where detrimental artifacts from reflections can be remedied. An integrated research-education program will leverage metamaterials as an overarching theme for several educational and broadening participation efforts. The developed educational tools will cater to students at all levels from elementary, through a partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of Buffalo, to aspiring undergraduates via partnerships with the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) and NY State's Collegiate Science & Technology Program (CSTEP). Research outcomes will culminate in a series of educational demonstrations of resonance and vibrations concepts to young engineers.<br/> <br/>The notion of exploiting time-periodic materials as means to break elastic reciprocity has faced several challenges pertaining to practicality and physical realization. This CAREER award aims to investigate a feasible path to the practical implementation of non-reciprocal metamaterials by exploiting the inherent geometric-dependence of elastic properties in non-axisymmetric cross-sections, while departing from hard-wired and shunted configurations. The project will derive the mechanics of a tunable elastic rectifier, which transmits energy in one-direction only via unidirectional band gaps relying on a prescribed phase shift between the geometric orientations of an array of rotating resonators, to induce a spatiotemporal stiffness profile. By developing a framework for the non-reciprocal wave dispersion mechanics in 2D/3D structures, the directivity of wave transmission will be characterized and translated into unprecedented material functions, including directional excitation filtering, diode-like effects, and the ability to confine the response to prescribed regions of a given structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most soft sensor designs respond similarly to these deformations, which limits their accuracy if more than one deformation occurs. Origami patterns, which have unique mechanical properties that cannot be achieved in flat materials, are promising solutions for more accurately measuring complex deformations. The goal of this work is to measure how stretchable and soft origami behaves and to study whether soft, origami-patterned sensors can distinguish pressure, strain, and curvature to realize a new class of soft deformation sensors. Soft, origami-patterned sensors will be modeled and fabricated. Their mechanical properties and sensing performance will be characterized. Female undergraduate engineering students at a women's college will participate in carrying out this research through summer and semester-long research opportunities. In conjunction with the research objectives, this project will encourage middle school students and teachers to learn about flexible sensors through a series of workshops. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to investigate whether soft material origami demonstrates mechanical properties that are advantageous for selective or multimodal strain, pressure, and curvature sensors. Silicone elastomers are flexible and compliant, which makes them excellent materials for use in soft sensing applications. Flat elastomer sensors, however, have non-specific responses to curvature, strain, pressure, and force. Changing the sensor morphology to bias the response towards one deformation may decouple these deformations while preserving the elastomer's advantageous properties. Origami and kirigami patterns are a promising approach to decoupling deformations and increasing mechanical selectivity. By modifying the pattern and fold angle or cut angle, origami and kirigami tessellations can tune the material's Poisson's ratio and stiffness. The project has three research objectives: 1) to model and characterize origami-patterned silicone elastomers under mechanical deformations, 2) to combine patterns that successfully decouple deformations with soft sensing modalities (e.g., resistive, capacitive), and 3) to fabricate origami patterned sensors with variable stiffness folds to demonstrate reconfigurable, high-dynamic range sensors. This investigation will increase fundamental understanding of the mechanical properties of origami-patterned silicone elastomers. The fabrication work will also yield new knowledge about generating such patterns in silicone elastomers and techniques to integrate mechanical sensing modalities into soft, three-dimensional structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In all these domains, it is crucial that robots be able to accept commands through natural language, so as to enable natural, effective, and understandable interaction. When commanded through natural language, robots must be able to ensure that the way that they achieve users' commands aligns with human expectations, especially the social and moral rules humans agree to by community consensus, known as social and moral norms. Moreover, if a robot is commanded in a way that cannot be fully achieved while complying with these social and moral norms, that robot must be able to explain to the user why it must reject the given command, offering acceptable alternatives when available. While there has been some previous work on ethical planning and command rejection, it has largely not accounted for cases in which robots are uncertain about social or moral norms or cases in which social and moral norms change between contexts. Research is needed to give robots the perceptual capabilities they need to identify such contexts, as well as the rich language understanding and generation abilities needed to communicate about social and moral norms.<br/><br/>This research will develop an Intelligent Physical System capable of (1) performing ethical reasoning using a dynamic set of norms that changes along with the robot's context, (2) using these reasoning capabilities to effectively reject or offer alternatives to inappropriate commands, and (3) learning rich representations of the contexts relevant to its set of moral and social norms. These capabilities are crucial as robots move into the real world, in which they (1) may be given unethical commands, either due to malfeasance or ignorance, (2) may be required to operate in not one context, but a variety of contexts, each which may have their own relevant social and moral norms, and (3) may need to learn about new contexts from both human instruction and their own perception. In order to develop this IPS in consideration of these real-world challenges, this research will produce the first algorithms for identifying and rejecting inappropriate commands in uncertain, dynamic, and realistically perceived contexts, using techniques form (1) natural language understanding and generation in uncertain and open worlds and Dempster-Shafer Theory; (2) task and motion planning through constrained inference and constrained optimization; and (3) representation learning for long-term autonomy and simultaneous localization and mapping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organisms, which live in surface ocean waters, require sunlight and nutrients to grow and reproduce. In the oceans around Antarctica, nitrate (NO3-) as a nutrient source of nitrogen (N) is usually abundant while the nutrient iron is often sparse. Light availability also changes from complete darkness to 24 hours of constant sunlight, as well as from low light deeper in the water column to high, stressful light at the ocean surface. As a consequence, the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean often live in a suboptimal environment in which conditions for growth are frequently changing. Scientists understand that nutrient supply and light availability affect these organisms and that these organisms, in turn, can alter the chemical composition of the seawater. For example, nitrate can occur in different forms, including a lighter (14N) and heavier (15N) form of NO3-, depending on which stable isotope of N is present in the molecule. Phytoplankton prefer to use the lighter isotope during uptake and incorporation into biomass, though the ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton has been shown to vary depending on environmental conditions. Notably, the isotope ratio used by phytoplankton is recorded in sediments and can be used to determine both the historic composition of ocean waters and the productivity of phytoplankton. This project will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress change the isotopic ratios of water column nitrate- in specific ways. A combination of laboratory culture and field experiments will be conducted. Cultures of important Southern Ocean phytoplankton species will be grown under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions where ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton, physiological changes, and molecular markers of iron and light stress and nitrate assimilation will be measured. Similar measurements will be done in shipboard experiments on a cruise in the Southern Ocean with South African colleagues. These data will increase our understanding of past and present productivity in the Southern Ocean, and how phytoplankton changed the chemical composition of the seawater. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the STEM field and graduate students from Florida State University and Old Dominion University as well as students from South Africa will collaborate on this project. The improved process understanding of the N isotope effect will be presented not only at scientific national and international conferences but also during local outreach events at local K12 schools.<br/><br/>Interpretation of both modern water column nitrate (NO3-) isotopic ratio (d15N) measurements generated by GEOTRACES and other cruises, as well as metrics of paleo-nutrient utilization, depend upon a mechanistic understanding of the degree to which NO3- assimilation by phytoplankton discriminates against the heavier isotope, 15NO3- (NO3- assimilation epsilon). We currently lack the ability to predict how iron and light stress impacts the NO3- assimilation epsilon. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress elevates the epsilon for NO3-assimilation. This hypothesis will be tested by a combination of laboratory culture work and field work on a cruise of opportunity in the Southern Ocean. Mesocosm experiments will include both increasing and alleviating light and/or iron stress on monoclonal phytoplankton cultures and in natural phytoplankton communities while measuring the response of the NO3- assimilation epsilon. Water column samples will be collected on the cruise for analysis of dissolved and size-fractionated particulate N concentration and d15N, as well as phytoplankton community composition, photophysiology and gene expression markers of iron and light stress and NO3- assimilation. In particular, the expression of iron and light stress markers will be used to evaluate the relative contribution of iron and light stress to field-based estimates of the NO3-- assimilation epsilon. The results from these field measurements, together with lab-based culture studies, will be used to constrain the range of the epsilon for NO3- assimilation under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions, including the potential alleviation of iron stress as has been hypothesized to have occurred during the last glacial maximum (a.k.a. the Martin hypothesis).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Severe natural disasters during the past decade include unprecedented flooding, devastating wildfires, and catastrophic hurricanes. On September 14, 2018, Hurricane Florence made landfall off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina, causing billions of dollars in damage to the state and surrounding region. Robeson County was one of the hardest hit counties in North Carolina, with catastrophic flooding causing substantial damage to residences, businesses, and infrastructure. The same county had experienced widespread damage following Hurricane Matthew in 2016 as well.  Many in the hardest hit areas were still experiencing long-term impacts from Hurricane Matthew in 2018, including loss of employment and physical health problems related to exposure to mold and other contaminants. Research focused on the experiences of individuals in this county offers a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals cope with and recover from severe and ongoing stress in the post-disaster context. This project seeks to gain a richer understanding of how individuals manage post-disaster recovery and the extent to which individual and social factors predict both positive and negative outcomes. By integrating theories of post-disaster adjustment and using advanced data analytic techniques, the current study will lead to a better understanding of individual and community responses to extreme events and inform the development of future interventions.<br/><br/>Online surveys and daily ""check in"" assessments administered via smart phone technology will be used to study psychological adjustment, social support, community solidarity, and coping efforts among adult residents of Robeson County, North Carolina who were exposed to severe and repeated hurricane-related stress. The surveys and the daily ""check-ins"" will provide critical data on how people cope with stress over time, including the extent to which social and individual factors affect adjustment. By cultivating a very rich set of data on the same individuals over time, it will be possible to discern patterns of recovery, and understanding which we are currently lacking. Measuring outcomes on a daily basis will generate significant amounts of data and we will use advanced non-linear data analysis methods to identify unique changes or shifts in functioning predicted by guiding theoretical frameworks (self-regulation shift theory and social support deterioration deterrence theory). This project extends current knowledge related to post-disaster recovery by targeting key social and coping mechanisms of change and highlighting possible critical targets for interventions in the near and long-term post disaster context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This may have happened to valuable oyster reefs in Northwest Florida in 2012, when drought and low river flow allowed predators of oysters to flourish and consume nearly all the oysters. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and river flow, oysters have not recovered, suggesting the ecosystem may have crossed a tipping point. However, the timing and magnitude of the disturbance from Hurricane Michael (2018) may have pushed the ecosystem back towards its original, healthy state.  In this project, investigators make field observations to gauge how predators and oysters are responding to Hurricane Michael and conduct lab experiments to test how predators and oysters respond to hurricane rainfall conditions. Additionally, they use mathematical models to predict whether effects observed in the field and lab could lead to a shift back past the tipping point. This is a rare opportunity to study how oyster ecosystems can shift back from altered to healthy states. However, a rapid response is essential before seasonal changes in the weather and bay obscure hurricane impacts. This research has several broader impacts. First, it will expand the ecological theory of tipping points. Second, it can support the management of the Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery, such as insight into the likely success of restoration efforts. The team coordinates with the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve to this end. Finally, research outputs are incorporated into ongoing public education and training efforts.<br/><br/><br/>Ecosystems can rapidly shift from their original, high-value state to a new, degraded one. Such shifts have been observed in many ecosystems, but it is sometimes difficult to identify the mechanisms that mediate the shift beyond a ""tipping point"" and - to a greater extent - those that could mediate a shift back to the original state. Improving our understanding and predictive capability of tipping points depends on identifying the mechanisms that underlie bi-directional system shifts. In 2012, the oyster reefs of Apalachicola Bay, FL abruptly shifted into an oyster-less state when prolonged drought and low river flow allowed marine oyster predators to flourish. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and flow, there has not been a return shift, suggesting this ecosystem may have entered an alternate stable state. The hypothesis of this work is that in 2018 Hurricane Michael provided a sufficient disturbance to shift the system back into the attracting basin for its original state (prior observations support this prediction). This project couples field observations and lab experiments with population modeling to test whether and how Hurricane Michael initiated a reversal shift. A rapid response is essential before seasonal variability in this ecosystem obscures hurricane effects. The proposal's intellectual merit is based on its ability to address a central goal in ecology: identifying and predicting ecosystem tipping points. Combining empirical observations and models is a promising approach to advance this goal, but has not been widely applied in the field, mainly because researchers are not in place at the time of a shift. Hurricane Michael provides a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principles of engineering and oceanography can be used to maximize the impact of a network of marine robots, but because fisheries managers, oceanographers, and roboticists have different perspectives and knowledge bases, it can be difficult to take advantage of cutting-edge research in each field without significant effort to translate among the groups. Researchers will develop a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. The system will be designed with input from fisheries managers through a series of workshops, and will be field-tested at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia.  The research will lead to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, as well as breakthroughs in key areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Many of the results will be applicable to other smart and autonomous systems in challenging environments.  In addition, the project will train graduate students and broaden undergraduate education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and offer a number of outreach activities, including working with the University of Georgia Marine Extension service to develop a summer camp for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The project is focused on developing an intelligent physical system (IPS) that consists of a heterogeneous fleet of marine robots, cooperatively tracking fish movement and surveying the habitat with minimum request for human intervention. The IPS will translate the human-specified missions of fisheries managers into goal-driven task designs for each robot, and automatically generate executable plans for the networked mobile sensing agents. The system will autonomously and persistently collect in-situ measurements and acoustic detections of fish species while maintaining multi-scale data streams and constructing multiple spatial-temporal maps reflecting the conditions of the ecosystem. The research aims to discover the hotspots (e.g., spatial locations with sustained congregations of fish), as well as illuminate more information about how and when fish move among these hotspots. This goal is quite challenging due to a number of gaps between project needs and the state-of-art autonomy research. Researchers will address the challenges through new developments that accomplish three main tasks: (1) Developing the goal-driven marine autonomy for fish habitat survey, (2) realizing the goal-driven autonomy on physical systems, and (3) evaluating the developed framework through real-life field work, experiments, and data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This striking appearance results from miniaturized body hair and increased sweat gland density (approximately 10 times higher than that of a chimpanzee). These adaptations allow humans to cool their body temperature through increased air flow over the skin and evaporation of water from the skin surface.  This project will find and explain the genomic changes underlying the human-specific evolutionary modifications to hair and sweat gland composition.  The biological insights, as well as the data, methods and tools developed as part of this research program, will provide novel assets to transform the investigation of the genetic bases of other adaptive skin traits and skin physiology more generally.  The data generated by this project also will advance ongoing efforts to build and properly pattern hair and eccrine glands in vitro, a major obstacle in comprehensive human skin regeneration.  In addition, this project will support the training of under-represented minority students and researchers, and fund the development of a public, educational website on human skin evolution, which will highlight outstanding questions in skin evolution and curate ongoing and new discoveries on this topic.<br/><br/>This research program builds on the recent discovery by the research team that a subset of biological signals that increase eccrine gland density also alter hair development, leading to diminished hair size. The working hypothesis of this project is that humans have acquired evolutionary mutations in regulatory sequences leading to concomitantly increased eccrine gland density and diminished hair size relative to other primates.  The researchers will (i) map out the regulatory sequences, or enhancers, that control the expression of a key developmental factor, En1, that reciprocally regulates eccrine sweat gland density and hair size; (ii) define the genomic changes within these enhancers that contributed to unique hair and sweat gland traits in humans, by investigating the functional significance of human-specific changes using genome edited mouse models of diverged human and chimpanzee regulatory sequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Characterizing these interactions is made possible through mass spectrometry (MS), a technique that breaks down complex biological samples into much simpler ions and measures their individual masses. Computer algorithms can then be used to interpret the output of MS experiments. The advent of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), also known as shotgun proteomics, led to a huge increase in the speed with which researchers can execute proteomics experiments, which in turn has enabled the creation of massive databases containing millions of known spectra. This research will create novel algorithms that will be able to quickly identify which proteins exist in a biological sample by comparing unknown spectra from the sample against entire libraries of known spectra. Ultimately, this project will make it easier for humans to understand the molecular basis of disease and will enable personalized medicine and identifying new drugs to tackle currently incurable diseases. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop novel methods for protein characterization in MS/MS experiment results that will provide increased spectral match effectiveness while scaling to search the largest existing protein databases and beyond. The key computational component in shotgun proteomics is matching MS/MS spectra against theoretical spectra or actual spectra in spectral databases to identify possible peptides (protein sections). In essence, given a translation of the spectra to points in the Euclidean space and a chosen proximity function, the algorithmic component in the search is a nearest neighbor search algorithm. Due to the large size of spectral databases, the problem has been traditionally solved through a variety of approximate nearest neighbor search methods and a combination of vector space and probabilistic proximity measures which are often not scalable and lead to missed spectral matches. This project aims to address these limitations in two ways. First, it will develop novel filtering-based exact nearest neighbor search methods for the shifted dot-product proximity measure, which has been recently shown to outperform alternatives by accounting for spectral post translational modifications while searching for matches. The proposed filtering-based methods prune much of the search space by eliminating potential candidates without computing their proximity to the query, based on their composition and on theoretic properties of the proximity measure. Second, the project will develop effective decomposition techniques for the inherently irregular computation requirements of the proposed pruning-based search that will enable distributed methods to search the largest proteomics databases of today, and beyond. The project will result in the dissemination of the developed methods to the large computational genomics community and will involve research education of underrepresented undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is focused on creating and testing an architecture for a robot that allows the system to be adaptable and ethical in its decision-making in complex situations. Since these systems may be called upon to adapt to evolving norms and cultural expectations, the development of an architecture that incorporates a range of philosophical theories and perspectives is crucially important. The robot's decisions will therefore be guided by multiple ethical frameworks and a simulated moral emotional state when they are tasked with making an ethical choice. Findings from the project could influence the design of countless types of robots including robot teachers, greeters, therapists, and companions. Thus, this research has the potential to impact large sections of society, including vulnerable populations such as individuals with disabilities that may interact with future robots. <br/> <br/>The different underlying computational architectures will be expanded to reason in multiple ways according to different ethical frameworks; the selection of the framework and resulting action will depend upon the moral emotional state of the agent. Moral emotions can help to guide decision making when conflicting choices are available as recommended by competing or cooperating ethical frameworks.  The robot models the human subject's moral emotional state to choose an ethical action (from a set of competing actions derived from different ethical frameworks)  to select an action that best conforms to the human's expectations, existing biases, and the situational context itself. Thus, the researchers will develop an action selection mechanism that recognizes the moral emotional state of the overall situation, and use it as a means for selecting the appropriate ethical action to undertake in the face of conflicting choices. Specifically this research will investigate the appropriateness of the application of other-deception (deception intended to benefit the human being deceived by the robot)  dependent upon the subject?s emotional state (e.g., shame, embarrassment, guilt, or empathy) and the specific task context to determine whether to have the robot deceive the subject or not based on these conditions.The plan is to encode ethical frameworks, such as Kantianism, Utilitarianism, and W.D. Ross?s moral duties, that will serve as a basis for a robot?s decision-making.  Moral emotions will help guide the robot towards the selection of which ethical framework should take dominance for a particular situation and individuals involved.  The approach will be tested in two main scenarios dealing with practical ethical decisions.  First, a robot playing a game with a child and the role of other-deception for losing on purpose based on the perceived emotional state of the child.  Second, a robot interacting with older adults who are performing tasks such as pill sorting and whether the robot should seek to reduce frustration to facilitate training with a potential trade-off on safety.  A key goal is to have the robot reproduce an average human ethical choice and/or a choice that reflects the consensus of ethical experts where available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All are experiencing complex and rapid socioeconomic changes as Indigenous communities in a globalizing environment. This database will measure population change and net migration, which provides key social indicators for assessing overall effects from many competing forces, and informing plans for the future. Previous work with preliminary versions of this database tested hypotheses about the impacts of the 2008 recession, and consequences of rising erosion in some villages on population dynamics. Newer analyses have compared population trends in northern Alaska with those of two other Inuit Arctic regions, Nunavut Territory in Canada, and Greenland.<br/><br/>The organization of this database facilitates integration of community demographics with other types of data such as resource use, environmental observations, and regional or place-based socioeconomic and health indicators. The data collected focus primarily on demographic data, including birth and death rates as well as migration patterns. Applications to date include characterizing demographic aspects of community change; modeling electricity consumption of individual communities; and testing hypotheses about environmental and economic effects on net migration. New analyses planned for the first two years of this project will address (1) inter- and intra-regional comparisons of Arctic community trends; (2) detection and testing for change in response to sudden events, new policies, or economic and environmental forces already in motion; (3) magnitude and impact of continuing gender differences in migration from indigenous communities; and (4) further analysis of differences between communities of Arctic Alaska, Greenland and northern Canada.

This barrier often stems from a newcomer's struggle to identify suitable reviewers, who are experienced in the change areas and are capable of writing useful reviews.

Despite extensive study of how wind erosion and dust emission occur, and how they affect Earth's atmosphere and human populations, little is known about where, when, and why the processes take place across different ecosystems, or how changes to Earth's ecosystems influence their rates at different locations over time. Understanding these interactions is important for land managers to identify where wind erosion and blowing dust may be a problem and act to sustainably manage agriculture and ecosystems over the long term. This research will examine how different types of ecosystem change occurring across North America due to human disturbances, drought, fire and invasive plant species impact rates of wind erosion and dust emission. The research will promote international collaboration among researchers in the United States and United Kingdom as part of a NSF/GEO-UK NERC project. It will produce new information that supports management of North American drylands and will generate educational materials for K-12 students and provide scientific training to underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research will establish wind erosion dust emission responses to regional ecosystem changes across North America due to three disturbance regimes: 1) numerous discrete, small scale (<10 ha), abrupt ecosystem changes associated with energy (oil and gas) development; 2) discrete, large scale (>1000 ha), abrupt ecosystem change associated with fire and ecological feedbacks that promote invasive grasses and altered fire-wind erosion regimes; and 3) diffuse, large scale (>1000 ha), pervasive ecosystem changes associated with sustained shrub invasion of desert grasslands. New aeolian (wind-driven) sediment transport models driven by remote-sensing and broad-scale standardized ecological datasets will be used to resolve the impacts of the regional ecosystem changes on wind erosion and dust emission. The models will be calibrated using data from US National Wind Erosion Research Network sites, then applied to explore patterns of dust emission across North America. National ecological datasets will be used to analyze the drivers and interpret dust emission responses to regional ecosystem changes across the disturbance regimes. The research will significantly improve our understanding of the coupling between the dust cycle and anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem change.

To progress toward this goal, the project team will focus on three major research activities.  First, they will conduct a bottom-up, four-pass analysis of literature spanning multiple research communities (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Science Education, Human-Computer Interaction, and Visualization) to summarize key design dimensions of visualizing intelligent systems.  Second, they will collect empirical evidence of how these systems are currently used and understood in the medical domain by observing how medical professionals interact with data and make sense of domain-specific intelligent systems.

However despite the pervasiveness of negation, current intelligent systems have great difficulty comprehending its effects, whereas people rarely do. One of the most important of these is the fact negation generally conveys some positive meaning. For example, a natural interpretation of ""John never leaves the house in the morning without a coffee in his hand"" suggests that John does leave the house in the morning and that he always does so with a coffee in his hand. This project builds novel resources and algorithms to enable intelligent systems to understand the numerous positive interpretations hidden in sentences containing negation. These resources and algorithms have the potential to empower dialogue systems to carry on more natural conversations, improve machine translation, and benefit virtually any end-user application requiring text understanding. Beyond fundamental research, this project will support a diverse cohort of PhD and undergraduate students as well as an interdisciplinary seminar at University of North Texas, international research stays for PhD students, workshops, and industry outreach activities.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this CAREER project are divided into three thrusts.

Research in mathematics provides students with important skills that they can use to analyze and solve problems in all disciplines and environments.  This program is extremely beneficial to undergraduate students because it introduces students to interdisciplinary research, it connects students with professors who will become important mentors and role models in their lives, and it yields new results that will impact multiple scientific disciplines, including immunology, oncology, emergency medicine, and mechanical engineering.  As the world continues to make technological advances at an incredibly rapid pace, there is an increased need for scientists and engineers.  Exposing the IUPUI REU Program students to applied mathematics research will encourage many of these students to pursue careers in STEM-related fields and will ultimately provide the United States with individuals who possess a deep knowledge of modern science and who are well equipped to have an impact on science and technology in the public and private sectors.  <br/><br/>The REU projects address new and open problems in applied mathematics, and the progress that the students make on the respective projects will advance research in transplant immunology, fluid dynamics, neuroscience, and mechanical engineering.

There are innovative public or private blockchain solutions for supply chains, the ""Internet of Things"", and beyond. In our highly inter-connected world, it is inevitable that these solutions will soon have to interact with each other. Similar to the Internet today, this will eventually result in formation of a network of blockchains where transactions flow across disparate blockchains. Some ad hoc industrial efforts have already begun in this direction; however, the scientific rigor is missing, and privacy and availability issues are pervasive. This project formally defines inter-blockchain communication (IBC) notions offering different privacy and availability trade-offs and securely realizes those notions toward real-world use by developing low-overhead cryptographic and/or crypto-economic solutions. The project's novelties includes careful abstractions of IBC primitives, efficient protocol designs offering innovative trade-offs between privacy and availability, and security analyses for the proposed tools and protocols. As the blockchains get connected over the coming years, numerous advances, particularly in the form of access technologies (e.g., blockchain counterparts of Internet transport protocols) will emerge, and the project's broader significance and importance includes offering robust, secure, and privacy-preserving communication platforms for development of these advanced technologies. Furthermore, as the current altruism in the blockchain space fades out and malicious activities become prevalent, the project's principled approach will become a necessity for inter-blockchain interactions.<br/><br/>This research designs and implements privacy-preserving IBC protocols in presence of malicious or crash-prone connector nodes as well as large-scale active network-level attackers. The project also studies the inverse relationships between privacy and non-blocking progress, and non-source routing and wormhole attacks, and develops a privacy-aware blueprint and open-source code-base that can form the basis of the transactions across the blockchains. The investigators actively interact with the blockchain community (in the form of publications, seminars, workshops, and course materials) to demonstrate the severity of privacy and availability vulnerabilities, and to promote the developed solutions. By improving fundamental understanding of privacy and availability of IBC, this project enables its end-to-end security that will ultimately enhance public confidence in the technology underlying the internet of blockchains and will lead to its rapid acceptance for decentralized and highly-available asset tracking across different domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cold tolerance, a special aspect of temperature sensitivity, is a key physiological capacity pertinent to all animals. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to the detection and modulation of cold sensitivity under normal and adaptive conditions are yet to be fully elucidated. This project aims to look at the general problem of cold sensitivity from a novel perspective - through studying cold-tolerant animals, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and Syrian hamsters. In addition to their ability to withstand deep cold during hibernation, squirrels and hamsters are cold tolerant even in the summer active state. This project seeks to understand the cellular and molecular basis of cold tolerance by performing a side-by-side comparison of physiological mechanisms in the squirrels, hamsters and mice. This research will highlight evolutionary changes that shaped cold tolerance and elucidate basic principles that underlie physiology of cold perception in vertebrates including humans. This project takes a multidiscplinary approach, involving behavioral paradigms, live-cell imaging, cell biology and in vitro biophysical analysis of ion channels to address this fundamental biological question. The PI will also run an innovative ""Sensory Physiology Club"" as a core outreach activity. The mission of the Club is to promote scientific education in human and animal physiology among school students from middle- and high schools. This activity will teach aspects of sensory biology and neural mechanisms underlying perception of sensory stimuli to school-aged children from Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts. An established collaboration with the Yale Pathways to Science and SCHOLAR programs, will serve to recruit participants and to monitor long-term impact of this program.<br/><br/>The major goal of this study is to understand the molecular basis of cold sensitivity in mammalian hibernators, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and Syrian hamsters. A comparison of cold-sensitive and cold-tolerant animals will reveal anatomical, physiological, and genetic factors that support hibernation, a unique thermo-adaptive process.  To investigate the abundance of temperature sensors in somatosensory system in active hibernators and compare it to mice, a non-hibernating species, histological analysis and live cell ratiometric calcium imaging of primary sensory neurons will be employed. It is known that Nav1.7 is a voltage-gated sodium channel responsible for initiation and propagation of action potential in somatosensory neurons. The proposal will test biophysical properties of squirrel and hamster Nav1.7 orthologues using electrophysiological recordings in heterologous cells and in neurons. Successful completion of this proposal will highlight molecular and cellular basis of cold tolerance and reveal a novel Nav1.7-mediated mechanism controlling cold temperature adaptations in mammalian hibernators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This may have happened to valuable oyster reefs in Northwest Florida in 2012, when drought and low river flow allowed predators of oysters to flourish and consume nearly all the oysters. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and river flow, oysters have not recovered, suggesting the ecosystem may have crossed a tipping point. However, the timing and magnitude of the disturbance from Hurricane Michael (2018) may have pushed the ecosystem back towards its original, healthy state.  In this project, investigators make field observations to gauge how predators and oysters are responding to Hurricane Michael and conduct lab experiments to test how predators and oysters respond to hurricane rainfall conditions. Additionally, they use mathematical models to predict whether effects observed in the field and lab could lead to a shift back past the tipping point. This is a rare opportunity to study how oyster ecosystems can shift back from altered to healthy states. However, a rapid response is essential before seasonal changes in the weather and bay obscure hurricane impacts. This research has several broader impacts. First, it will expand the ecological theory of tipping points. Second, it can support the management of the Apalachicola Bay oyster fishery, such as insight into the likely success of restoration efforts. The team coordinates with the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve to this end. Finally, research outputs are incorporated into ongoing public education and training efforts.<br/><br/><br/>Ecosystems can rapidly shift from their original, high-value state to a new, degraded one. Such shifts have been observed in many ecosystems, but it is sometimes difficult to identify the mechanisms that mediate the shift beyond a ""tipping point"" and - to a greater extent - those that could mediate a shift back to the original state. Improving our understanding and predictive capability of tipping points depends on identifying the mechanisms that underlie bi-directional system shifts. In 2012, the oyster reefs of Apalachicola Bay, FL abruptly shifted into an oyster-less state when prolonged drought and low river flow allowed marine oyster predators to flourish. Despite subsequent years of normal rainfall and flow, there has not been a return shift, suggesting this ecosystem may have entered an alternate stable state. The hypothesis of this work is that in 2018 Hurricane Michael provided a sufficient disturbance to shift the system back into the attracting basin for its original state (prior observations support this prediction). This project couples field observations and lab experiments with population modeling to test whether and how Hurricane Michael initiated a reversal shift. A rapid response is essential before seasonal variability in this ecosystem obscures hurricane effects. The proposal's intellectual merit is based on its ability to address a central goal in ecology: identifying and predicting ecosystem tipping points. Combining empirical observations and models is a promising approach to advance this goal, but has not been widely applied in the field, mainly because researchers are not in place at the time of a shift. Hurricane Michael provides a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects flap their wings to fly in air, and zooplanktonic marine snails called sea butterflies flap wing-like appendages (called parapodia) to ""fly"" in water. Further, some tiny insect species are able to locomote via wing flapping in both air and water. Despite the thousand-fold difference in density between air and water, the flight systems of these very different animals show surprising similarities in how the wings move and in how they generate lift. These similarities point towards the possibility of designing a bio-inspired micro-aerial vehicle capable of aerial and aquatic flapping flight, but the fluid dynamics of such flight systems are not well understood. The aim of this project is to investigate the fluid dynamics of small-scale biological flapping systems flying in air, in water, and in both. This research will occur within the larger context of an education program in which underrepresented engineering students prepare for graduate studies by learning research skills, creating an illustrated children's book about sea butterflies, and attending a graduate class field trip.<br/><br/>Tiny insects and sea butterflies (pteropods) use similar wing kinematics and lift generation techniques to propel themselves in air and water, respectively. Further, some insects use their wings for both aerial flight and aquatic swimming. However, neither the fluid dynamics of aerial and aquatic flapping locomotion at low Reynolds numbers nor the adaptations these animals have made to fly in air, water, or both are well understood. This project will experimentally investigate these adaptations and the underlying fluid physics of flapping flight in air, water, and both by a diverse group of insects and pteropod species, with the following outcomes: 1) High speed kinematics and volumetric flow measurements of swimming pteropods will show how extreme wing flexibility affects lift production. 2) A novel, ultra-high-speed particle image velocimetry system will provide measurements of the 3D kinematics used by and the flow generated by freely flying tiny insects. 3) Kinematics and flow measurements of the swimming and flying of tiny aquatic insects will reveal how an aerial flight system can be adapted to aquatic operation. These outcomes will illuminate the core fluid dynamics principles underlying this locomotion technique, build understanding of the adaptations animals have made for flapping locomotion in air and water, and inspire design strategies for multimodal micro-aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All animals do it, and sleep is very tightly regulated. The consensus view of sleep regulation involves the interaction of time-of-day driven processes and homeostatic processes. A biological daily clock signals organisms to be awake at the appropriate time of day, whereas a homeostatic process drives when, how long, and how deep animals sleep after having been awake. Although there is a good understanding of the biological clock and how it promotes wakefulness, little is known about how sleep homeostasis works. Previous studies by this group of investigators has uncovered a novel genetic tool useful for gaining understanding of this fundamental aspect of sleep regulation in mammals. However, before dissecting how sleep homeostasis works, it is necessary to identify the neurons involved in the regulation of sleep homeostasis and where in brain they are located.  This project leverages the novel genetic tool, together with cutting-edge genetic and neuron-level brain imaging techniques, to identify the specific neurons that are essential for sleep homeostasis in mammals. Identification of these sleep homeostasis neurons is critical for research aimed at uncovering the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis in animals. The project also provides extensive opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to gain hands-on research experiences, with the goal of increasing participation of members from underrepresented groups in STEM professions.<br/><br/>The essential neuroanatomy and subsequent mechanistic underpinnings regulating sleep homeostasis in mammals are largely unknown. The principal investigator and colleagues discovered a novel genetic tool useful for gaining understanding this fundamental aspect of sleep regulation, the mechanisms of sleep homeostasis. Specifically, the principal investigator found that mice inheriting a null Ube3a allele specifically from their mother (Ube3am-/p+) lack neuronal UBE3a expression and all known homeostatic sleep responses. The heterozygous nature of this sleep phenotype, combined with floxed Ube3a alleles that allow for either Cre-dependent loss- or rescue- of UBE3a expression, and a growing resource of transgenic lines expressing Cre recombinase in subsets of neurons coalesce into a unique opportunity to employ a behavioral genetics strategy to identify essential sleep homeostat neurons in mice. Here, the investigators use Cre-directed UBE3a loss/rescue to address three fundamental aspects of sleep homeostasis: identify which neurons are involved, when they are involved, and where they are located. The studies include optimization and implementation of UBE3a immunofluorescence detection in intact, cleared brains visualized by 3D light-sheet microscopy. The anticipated outcome of the project is genetic, behavioral, electrophysiological and anatomical identification of essential sleep homeostat neurons in mice.  The findings are critical for future work aimed at dissecting the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This symposium topic was chosen to coincide with the theme of the 2019 Black History month. Migration has played a central role in the histories of Africans and their descendants. For some, migration was entirely voluntary while others were forced to move due to violence, political destabilization, ecological degradation, or other upheavals. Black migrations have also resulted in more diverse and stratified interracial populations that have reshaped the societies of the receiving areas. In more recent periods, scholars have begun exploring the impact out-migration and return migration have had on the development and stability of various majority black societies. In addition, scholars, students, and activists have been examining the relation between relocation and conceptualizations of blackness. <br/><br/>This two-day symposium will examine black migrations to include relocations within and beyond the US. Symposium organizers will seek papers from scholars and students that discuss various periods and streams of migration that have shaped the histories and contemporary realities of African people and their descendants.  An important aspect of this conference is that it will also bring together academic statisticians and geographers who are working on the modeling of migrations and related problems (e.g., population flows).  This is a unique opportunity to link the STEM discipline of Statistics with an important and timely topic that has not traditionally made use of advanced statistical methodology.  That is, Statistics has a long history of considering models for demographic population change (e.g., flow models) but there is little cross-disciplinary interaction between statisticians and researchers who have focused on Black Migration.  This may be the first such symposium that seeks to bring these groups together.  Thus, an important goal of the symposium is to encourage the interchange and mutual understanding of research ideas in statistics, geography, and black migrations, and to give motivation and direction to further research progress, particularly for young researchers, in a manner not ordinarily possible at other meetings.

Building on a 90-year research history on ecology in natural and human-modified forests, the Luquillo LTER has shown that while tropical forests exhibit resilience to individual disturbance events, the potential combination of increased frequency of intense storms, like Hurricane Maria in 2017, and more frequent drought, may compromise ecosystem resilience in the long-term. The Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) combines long-term measurements, experimental manipulations, and computer simulations to determine the effects of changes in the frequency and intensity of disturbance events, such as hurricanes and droughts, on tropical forests represented by the Luquillo Mountains in eastern Puerto Rico, USA. During the next six years, the Luquillo LTER will document the impacts of Hurricane Maria, the most intense storm to impact the island in ninety years, on the forests of the Luquillo Mountains while continuing to evaluate the potential effects of increased drought predicted for the region. It is important to understand how tropical forests respond to these disturbance events because they play a key role in global carbon and water dynamics and provide essential ecosystem services, such as clean water and carbon dioxide absorption, to people worldwide. The Luquillo LTER will continue to train numerous undergraduate and graduate students, as well as secondary school students and teachers, especially members of underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of new multidisciplinary scientists and citizens who have the skills and experiences to address the pressing environmental challenges of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>The research tests hypotheses that changing disturbance regimes, interacting with the effects of past disturbance events, will result in new combinations of species and altered biogeochemical dynamics different from previous environmental conditions and characteristics. These new ecosystem states will arise from the legacies of multiple disturbances, as well as from the immigration of species adapted to drier and hotter conditions associated with canopy openings and more frequent droughts. The research will continue to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of biota and biogeochemical processes in native tabonuco forest and leverage elevational variation in the Luquillo Mountains as a climate proxy to provide context for our measurements. The continuing Canopy Trimming Experiment will test hypotheses that more frequent intense hurricanes will increase the dominance of shade intolerant species with cascading effects through other biota and consequences for biogeochemical dynamics. Two new experiments, the Throughfall Exclusion Experiment and the Stream Flow Reduction Experiment, will address hypotheses that increased drought frequency will alter species composition and distribution as well as soil carbon and nutrient storage along hillslopes and in streams. Computer models and data-model integration will provide predictive understanding of the combined effects of increased drought and hurricane frequency on tropical forests, as well as facilitate synthesis across scales, and forecasting of future ecosystem states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.<br/><br/>This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representatives of a public school district, a state university, a college of engineering, and a center for environmental research and technology will collaborate in designing, implementing, and examining the impacts of the curriculum on student understanding of air quality, health risks associated with reduced air quality, and pathways to careers in air quality monitoring and management. The project is located in an area where air quality is a significant environmental concern, and where there are opportunities for students to gain direct experiences with emerging technologies associated with air quality monitoring and mitigating environmental impacts.  Over a two-year period, the project will implement 18 new air-quality lessons developed by teachers within existing high school science courses.  The project will also engage participating teachers in related professional learning opportunities focusing on research and culturally responsive teaching during summers and through weekly meetings during the academic year.  The project will be guided by an Advisory Board that includes representatives of local academic institutions, industry partners, and government agencies.<br/><br/>The aims of this project are to: (a) Enhance a high school science curriculum by incorporating newly developed lessons focusing on air-quality monitoring, (b) Evaluate the effectiveness of the new curriculum and associated teacher professional learning opportunities in promoting student understanding of the impacts of air quality on their everyday lives, (c) Identify intra-personal, inter-personal, and cultural influences on the effectiveness of the new air quality curriculum intervention, and (d) Raise awareness among students of possible career opportunities with environmental industries locally and globally.  The 18 new lessons being developed by the project will be tested through a randomized control research design involving a minimum of 30 science teachers across five comprehensive high schools of a large metropolitan school district.  Approximately 2,100 students in grades 10 and 11 will be engaged in the classrooms of the study, with 15 teachers and 1050 students involved in the treatment groups, and in the comparison groups. Teachers in the treatment groups will participate in a summer research experience where they learn to use the technologies and procedures associated with air quality monitoring, and during the subsequent school year they will develop lessons on air quality monitoring that will be incorporated within their standard classes.  Teachers in the comparison group will conduct business as usual and implement the regular science curriculum.  The guiding questions for research are: (a) How can experiences with emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students to gain familiarity with relevant competencies and what factors might influence learning experiences? (b) What factors and key experiences may effectively promote awareness of STEM careers, motivation to pursue a STEM career, and persistence in undertaking education pathways to those careers? (c) What culturally responsive instructional and curricular practices and models used by teachers can enhance student understanding of and interest in STEM occupations?

The complex timing, movements, and interactions of populations, cultures, and technology in the past are an important part of our human story. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic and geochemical analyses of human skeletal material from the Chelechol ra Orrak site in Palau, western Micronesia, to investigate prehistoric colonization of an island setting during one of the most widespread and rapid dispersals in human history. Despite this being the last major geographical region to be colonized by humans, information regarding the timing, direction, and origins of settlement in many respects remains unclear. This research will also make broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through undergraduate training and mentorship at the University of Oregon; community involvement and outreach through public talks and the distribution of comics about aDNA in archaeology in Palau; and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to underrepresented elementary and middle school students in Oregon.<br/><br/>The investigators will analyze human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for Micronesia and provide critical baseline information for future isotopic and genetic research in the region. The objective of this research is to investigate the origins of prehistoric Palauans on a regional scale and subsequent local human mobility within the archipelago following settlement. While linguistic, computer modeling, and biodistance studies have resulted in hypotheses identifying broad general regions of Micronesian population origins, numerous questions regarding the relationship of early Micronesians to other regional populations, and a more specific area of origin still remain. In generating aDNA data for western Micronesia, this project will place early Palauans in a regional framework to examine broader scale genetic relationships. Examination of mobility via strontium (87Sr/ 86Sr) and lead (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) isotope analysis from human remains--in conjunction with biological and geological samples taken from locations across the archipelago--will help to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime and shed light on inter-island mobility during the earliest phases of settlement in Palau.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers at the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program (CDR) are using long-term models and data from grasslands, savannas, and forests to understand and forecast how these interacting human-driven environmental changes will alter the earth?s ecosystems and the ability of ecosystems to provide the services that support human well-being. This work builds on the CDR hallmark of combining data from long-term experiments and observations to explore the interactive effects of changes in resources (nutrients, atmospheric carbon dioxide), abiotic aspects of the environment (temperature, precipitation), biodiversity, and disturbance (fire, land use change) on linked ecological processes at local to global scales. In addition to this primary research goal, the CDR program will continue to develop a diverse, globally competitive workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) by mentoring undergraduate researchers and providing them with independent research and professional development opportunities. CDR also will continue to increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through K-12 education programs, citizen science activities, membership and volunteer programs, public tours, adult education, as well as arts and humanities partnerships. These activities reach thousands of visitors and participants each year, including teachers, neighbors, public officials, and other members of the public in Minnesota.<br/><br/>CDR research will continue its multi-decadal studies of the ecological impacts of multiple environmental change drivers, including the longest-running biodiversity and elevated CO2 experiments in the world, and some of the world's longest-running studies of nutrient enrichment and fire frequency.

For example, a new forest biodiversity experiment will build on past CDR biodiversity research to disentangle the roles of multiple facets of biodiversity (functional, phylogenetic, and species) and use trees to test the generality of biodiversity theory. Second, new experiments replicated in the long-term biodiversity experiment and savanna will determine the interactive effects of drought, nutrients, warming, and biodiversity on ecosystem processes and stability.

Metals conduct electricity because of the free movement of the electrons whereas insulators cannot conduct electricity. The topological insulator (TI) is a new state of matter in which a material is non-conducting throughout its bulk but is guaranteed to have very stable conducting states on its surface. This surface conduction is protected against disturbance by the basic constraints of the material's underlying symmetry. Topological properties of materials are a fascinating subject of study in contemporary condensed matter physics. The discovery of the first TI tremendously accelerated research into phases of matter characterized by non-trivial topological states such as Dirac, Weyl and nodal-line semimetals, the topological crystalline insulator, and the topological superconductor. Dirac and Weyl semimetals provide a platform to study both bulk (linearly dispersive) and surface (Fermi arc) states. It is important to note that, to date, most of the observed topological materials realized experimentally are found in weakly correlated electronic band systems where the correlation between the electrons are largely ignored. This research proposes to discover and understand the electron correlation in topological materials. Topological quantum materials promise to bring upon a new age in areas such as spintronics and quantum computation among other next generation technologies. Progress in these areas helps to increase the ability to store and process larger amounts of data at higher speeds. There are other applications of strategic interest such as cryptography and safe communications. This project aims to help recruit, mentor, and prepare underrepresented minority students into Physics PhD programs through the American Physical Society (APS)-funded Bridge Program as well as to increase the production of highly qualified high school Physics teachers through ""PhysTEC"" program. Education materials based on the progress of the quantum materials are prepared to help students, teachers and the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>The field of topological materials has grown exponentially since the first three-dimensional topological insulator material was discovered in 2007. It is currently impacting large bodies of condensed matter physics, chemistry, materials sciences, and engineering communities worldwide. Moreover, most work thus far has focused on simple materials where electronic correlation effects can be largely ignored, and the topological properties are well described in terms of a single-particle band structure. The introduction of strong electron correlation opens up a novel field of research in a topological insulating state. This project aims to discover and understand the unusual Dirac fermion states in strongly correlated electron systems, the nature of the correlations in these novel states are distinctly different from those found in graphene, topological insulators, and Weyl semimetal. Specifically, this project utilizes high-resolution angle-, spin- and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques to study the electronic and spin properties as well as the momentum resolved dynamical properties of the bulk and symmetry-protected surface properties of rare-earth (4f)-based compounds to discover and understand the possible signature of the strongly correlated topological phase. The planned research provides the electronic signatures for the correlated topological phase, heavy Weyl fermion phase and magnetic topological insulator phases, as well as their light-matter interactions, thus opening up a new direction of research into the topological and Weyl phases facilitated by strong correlations. The educational component of the project is to motivate students from high schools to universities to pursue quantum materials research so that they become potential leaders in the field of condensed matter physics, spectroscopy, vacuum technology, laser technology and nanoscience. The educational plans create a system that inspires, educates, and provides the opportunities necessary for the younger generations to take steps and become the scientists of tomorrow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A unifying computational motif in the seemingly disparate fields of big data analytics and scientific computing is that the models currently used to solve the relevant problems often result in large amount of data with significant, irregular gaps (technically known as ""sparse matrices""). The scale of solving such problems typically require execution on massively parallel computers. Due to the unique characteristics associated with sparse matrix computations, achieving high performance and scalability is challenging. This project aims to develop an extensive set of scalable sparse matrix algorithms and software to address such challenges. By significantly improving the productivity of domain scientists working on big data analytics and scientific computing, this project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense. Research plans are tightly integrated with educational and outreach objectives at various levels. The centerpiece of the outreach efforts is a Computer Science summer school and mentorship plans for high school students. <br/><br/>To tackle the challenges presented by the increasingly deep memory hierarchies of modern computer architectures that include cache, high-bandwidth device memories (HBM), DRAM, and non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) and facilitate high performance execution of sparse matrix computations, a comprehensive research plan is explored. The centerpiece of this project is a data-flow middleware with a simple application programming interface, called DeepSparse, that aims to support a wide variety of sparse solvers, while ensuring architecture and performance portability. DeepSparse converts a given sparse solver code into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent computational tasks and edges represent the data-flow between tasks. Novel DAG partitioning and scheduling algorithms, which are also extended to their hypergraph counterparts, are developed to ensure that data movement between memory layers is minimized during execution of the task graph. Performance models based on the extended Roofline model and innovative memory management schemes that draw upon ideas from disk storage systems are explored to ensure high bandwidth and low latency access to sparse solver data on NVRAM devices. All software and tools developed in this research are distributed as open source projects for a broad impact. Overall, goals of this project are well aligned with the National Strategic Computing Initiative, which aims to foster innovations that can bring the fields of big data analytics and scientific computing closer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Based on scientific claims that nanoparticles are detrimental to an individuals health, regulatory agencies, companies, and the general public have become more vigilant in finding non-nano alternatives to materials and products that they have been using. In addition to providing a non-nano alternative to existing metal oxides used in many personal care products, this project also allows for more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and end products. Cost-effective synthetic methods will allow for these alternatives to be feasible replacements to formulators, toxicologists, and other people involved in the manufacturing decision-making process.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to focus on finding the best product market fit for the novel synthetic methodology of Zinc Oxide. This synthesis relies on milder temperatures with only water-based precursors that are utilized to yield surfactant-free, morphologically identical, and non-nano zinc oxide particles. The same methodology can be use to yield metal-doped zinc oxide constructs with enhanced properties depending on the metal used.

Intensification of agricultural and urban practices in recent decades has led to the eutrophication of many inland lakes and streams. Cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) often thrive in such nutrient-rich waters.  Excessive growth of cyanobacteria can cause ecological, aesthetic, and health hazards, and may cause disruptions to drinking water systems, foul beaches, and produce toxins dangerous to human and aquatic life. Lake managers would like to predict the intensity of cyanobacteria abundance and overall ecosystem health prior to the summer season, but current methods for doing so are limited, often leading to only reactive lake management and recreational and beach safety. This research and education project will explore methods to better predict cyanobacteria abundance from hydroclimatic variables (such as temperature, precipitation and streamflow) to enable better lake management.   <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to answer four questions: Q1. How well can season-ahead prediction models conditioned on hydroclimatic variables (explicitly or in conjunction with biological factors) anticipate cyanobacteria abundance? Q2. Can physically-based models coupled with prediction models further enhance predictability and lead toward an improved understanding of local environmental and biological mechanisms? Q3. Can prediction models be extended to describe expected bloom formation and seasonal beach closings to inform beach planning and management? Q4. Is the prediction framework transferable and how well does it perform for various eutrophic lakes, particularly ones that are less well monitored? Research themes will be integrated into educational objectives designed to promote learning and development across several age groupings to: 1) foster citizen science participation, training, and analytical skills; 2) excite and prepare students and teachers from middle school through graduate school; and 3) enhance local agency decision-making capacity. These goals will be accomplished by introducing new water quality tests for citizen science monitors, developing new games and simulations targeting middle and high school students for delivery at science fairs and after school programs, hosting research retreats, and providing models, tools, and trainings to local agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preparing today's students to work with data fluently is critical to ensuring a scientifically literate and empowered citizenry. But most efforts to incorporate data analysis into the K-12 curriculum are limited to short, isolated activities; basic skills development; or, are introduced as new courses devoted specifically to data and computing, limiting both the potential benefits and the audience for such efforts. This project seeks to integrate computational data analysis into the middle school science curriculum in a longitudinal, interdisciplinary way - drawing from the computer and data sciences, literacy studies, statistics, and science education to saturate the classroom with relevant tools, resources, and support. Middle school classrooms will analyze and draw conclusions about publicly available scientific datasets using a free, innovative, computational data analysis platform called the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP). Units will be designed specifically with Dual Language Learners (DLL) in mind, inviting students to share their investigations by writing multimodal texts that blend both familiar and academic modes of expression to explain and contextualize their data analysis processes. Units that build on one another in difficulty and complexity will be introduced throughout the academic year, and participating teachers will receive significant training opportunities. Overall the project is anticipated to directly impact approximately 2,500 students and 20 teachers in the greater San Francisco Bay area, from predominantly high needs schools.<br/><br/>The project will provide a research context to address the following questions: How do students learn, over time, to use computational tools to structure, calculate, filter, and transform data for scientific inquiry? What patterns of engagement in scientific practices are supported by the integration of computational data analysis and visualizations into the science curriculum? And, what new literacy practices might support DLL and learners with limited access to technology or who are still developing academic literacy in constructing oral and written arguments and explanations using data and visualizations as evidence? Specifically, it brings together and seeks to extend three complementary research constructs. Data moves are the computational actions analysts take to transform and analyze datasets. Syncretic texts are specialized texts that blend academic discourse, such as the formulae and statistical language needed to explain data analysis, with the familiar modes of expression (including home languages and alternative forms of expression such as video, art, animation, etc.), which has been found to invite a wide range of marginalized students to experiment with and develop academic language. Finally, a community of learners approach allows different student groups in a classroom to conduct and share the results of different investigations with the same dataset, making the exploration of large and complex data more feasible in everyday classrooms. Analyses will make use of video, CODAP log data, students' written texts, and pre-post assessments to investigate learning and participation longitudinally over the course of an entire academic year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Countless molecular species have strong and ""fingerprint"" like absorption lines in the MIR to THz spectral range, and consequently absorption spectroscopy based molecular sensing technologies with superior sensitivity and selectivity can be developed in this spectral range. Furthermore, as the demand for communication bandwidth keeps growing rapidly, wireless communication technologies are moving from the GHz frequency range towards the THz frequency range. Therefore, research advances in the MIR to THz range will continue to drive development of technologies and applications in important areas such as health care, homeland security, environmental protection, energy production, communications and internet of things. However, current device technologies for this spectral range are not as diverse and mature as those for the other spectral ranges. Aligned with the long-term career goals of the principle investigator, this CAREER proposal aims at developing new types of MIR and THz light sources based on unconventional device architectures and operating principles. Specifically, the proposed light sources will synergistically combine the advantages of graphene plasmonics and intersubband transitions in quantum wells, which are two powerful device technologies for the MIR to THz spectral range. Exploiting strong interactions between intersubband transitions in quantum wells and graphene surface plasmons (GSPs) is expected to lead to devices with improved performances, lower cost and extended functionalities. The proposed CAREER project will provide valuable opportunities and resources to help the participating students becoming the next-generation scientists and engineers who can play leading roles on the competitive global stage. The principle investigator will also actively organize and participate outreach activities which will disseminate the research outcomes and/or stimulate K-12 students' interests in the STEM disciplines. These activities will be designed to attract participation of students of diverse backgrounds, including those from the under-represented groups. <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>This proposed CAREER project aims at first thoroughly studying the fundamental properties of strong interactions between GSPs and intersubband transitions in quantum wells, and subsequently utilizing the obtained knowledge to develop two types of unconventional MIR and THz sources, which are (1) graphene plasmonic antenna-enhanced light emitters and (2) electrically-pumped GSP sources. Coupling between MIR or THz GSPs and resonant intersubband transitions in quantum wells establishes an intriguing physical system and a new platform for device applications. This project will focus on investigating several fundamental aspects of these interactions, including the potential modification of transition selection rules, the Purcell effect, the dependence of interaction strength on graphene carrier density and structure geometries, and the transition energy shift associated with non-vertical transitions. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects is crucial for the subsequent device development. Conventional MIR and THz light emitters suffer from the low efficiency of radiative transition process which has a lifetime by orders of magnitude longer than the non-radiative lifetime. The proposed graphene plasmonic antenna-enhanced MIR and THz light emitters aim at exploiting the strong interactions between GSPs and intersubband transitions, which are expected to lead to a drastic reduction of the radiative lifetime and hence a significant improvement of output power and power efficiency. In contrast to the conventional methods of generating GSPs via optical excitation, the proposed devices employing graphene plasmonic waveguides coupling to intersubband transitions are electrically pumped surface plasmon sources, which are much more compact and convenient to use in applications such as on-chip sensing and communications. Both types of proposed MIR and THz sources have large frequency tunability, which is another key advantage of graphene based devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hurricanes are important and frequent disturbances in southeastern U.S. ecosystems, and were important in shaping pre-settlement ecosystems. Hurricanes significantly damage forests as the hurricane makes landfall and moves inland. The damage extent varies with both hurricane characteristics and forest composition and structure. Hurricane Michael moved across the Northern Gulf of Mexico in 2018, resulting in catastrophic winds (Category 2 force) that reached over 100 miles inland and caused extensive damage along its path. The storm's impact to forests varied with local conditions (e.g. soil, topography) and the forest management strategies present across this area. The implications of this damage to the carbon, water, and energy cycles of these forests, the relationships between impacts, storm intensity, and forest management, and how the forests will recover are poorly understood. This RAPID award will explore how the physical and ecological changes from hurricane damage affect the coupled biogeochemical cycles of these forests. This award will provide local and regional forestry and resource managers, conservation professionals, policy makers, timber industry representatives, and small private landowners practical understanding of hurricane impacts and the potential for recovery based on demonstrations, development of management strategies, and potential policies for natural resource management and conservation.<br/> <br/>The primary goal of this RAPID award is to determine the disturbance-related shift in ecosystem structure and function as it relates to the resilience of the longleaf pine savanna from disturbances such as hurricanes. In southern Georgia and northern Florida, Hurricane Michael damaged longleaf pine forests by downing whole trees and resulted in extensive loss of branches and leaves. Efforts to maintain and restore longleaf pine ecosystems in this regional include long-term studies that show the importance of its ecosystem services, including carbon, water and energy exchange. Three of these long-term forest sites in the southeastern NEON domain were in the hurricane path and are proposed to study the mechanistic controls on carbon, energy, and water cycling following the extensive hurricane damage. Using these sites, this study will provide a vulnerability assessment of the effects of hurricanes and an understanding of ecological resilience using thermodynamic metrics. The award will explore fundamental thermodynamic concepts to understand the impacts and explain the resilience and recovery of these forests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the proposed project is to enable a given UAV to predict the trajectories of its neighboring UAVs, dynamically assess collision risks, and automatically resolve potential conflicts without the need for constant human supervision. This project seeks to: 1) implement the ability to operate a multitude of UAVs without direct human oversight in a way that might satisfy future FAA regulations; 2) establish a mathematical representation of a UAV traffic that can be scaled to handle a complex, heterogeneous, and high-dimensional traffic; and 3) mature UAV operations for civil and commercial applications in harmony with existing commercial air traffic.<br/><br/>The project aims at developing a real-time, distributed decision-making algorithm, the Dynamic Network-based Probabilistic Route Planner (DNPRP), for autonomous operation of multiple UAVs in congested environments.

This aspect of decision making is important in order for the robotic agent to generate predictable behaviors which are necessary in order to establish trust in human-machine teams. Traditional approaches to solve this problem assume that humans are well-informed, perfectly rational agents that always reach the optimal (e.g., the best decision). Several empirical studies, however, suggest that most humans do not act as perfectly rational agents when making decisions but rather as bounded-rational ones. In other words, they do not try to get the best possible outcome unconditionally, but rather they tend to weight the benefits of reaching the best outcome subject to constraints (time, cognitive effort, energy, money, or just laziness). Using this key idea, this research will investigate decision-making for autonomous systems subject to resource constraints. Similar to how humans make decisions, instead of trying to get the optimal decision no matter what, the decision-making process will have to factor in the computational, information, or energy constraints available to the agent. <br/><br/>This project investigates the interaction between autonomous robotic agents and other agents either human or robotic, while considering the decision-making constraints of the agents. Instead of focusing on maximizing expected utility (as in standard formulations) this research will address the maximization of expected free utility (or free energy), a quantity that encapsulates in a precise manner the effect of information and computational constraints of the decision-making process. The results of this research will be applied to the case of multiple agents having perhaps conflicting objectives.  As a test case this framework is applied to the problem of autonomous vehicles in traffic including both human drivers and other self-driving vehicles. By adapting the agent's decision-making process to the available resources, this framework can be used to generate a hierarchy of abstractions for decision-making brought about by the severity of information-processing costs. Each abstraction is tailored to the ""right"" level of granularity of the problem. That is, coarser abstraction levels are preferred when the computational resources are scarce and finer (more accurate) levels of abstraction when the computational resources are plentiful. Finally, ""theory of mind"" principles will be utilized to design bounded-rational decision-making algorithms that avoid the infinite regress between conflicting agents. This infinite regress hinders the computation of purely rational equilibria and will be avoided by adopting a framework that restricts each player's depth of recursive inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research contributions encompass developing (i) algorithms for reliable and adaptive deep-tissue communication, (ii) techniques for accurate cross-medium backscatter localization, and (iii) integrated sensing platforms that combine communication, localization, and sensing on battery-free micro-implants. The proposed research will extend beyond the conception of algorithms and systems to the implementation and evaluation of real-world prototypes.

Despite ongoing efforts, clinicians have a bare-bones understanding of these disorders, and hence, a limited ability to treat them. From an analytics perspective, clinical neuroscience is a field of high-dimensional datasets, small sample sizes, massive patient variability, and most importantly, an arguable lack of ground truth information. These challenges have led to a trade-off between the interpretability of a given model and its generalizability to new data. At one extreme, classical statistics allows us to formulate and test interpretable hypotheses about the brain, but it cannot make patient-specific generalizations. At the other extreme, conventional machine learning algorithms are geared towards patient generalizability but rarely illuminate a brain-basis for the prediction. This CAREER program will develop a Coupled Network Optimization (CNO) framework that balances the two analytical extremes. The resulting algorithms will reveal interpretable system-level interactions in the brain that can predict the behavioral and cognitive deficits of a given disorder. In parallel, the investigators have formulated a diverse range of educational initiatives to train the next generation of interdisciplinary data scientists.<br/><br/>Mathematically, the CNO framework estimates a low-dimensional network manifold for functional neuroimaging data. The elemental bases of this manifold will correspond to interpretable group-level features, whereas the patient-specific projections will capture predictive information. The technical exploration of this award will unfold in three modular stages, each of which tackles an open challenge in the field. Thrust I will improve the CNO interpretability by imposing a patient-specific graph topology to guide the salient functional interactions. Thrust II will advance the CNO generalizability by introducing nonlinear and nonparametric regression models. Finally, Thrust III will leverage an equivalent Bayesian representation to tackle the challenges of multisite analysis. The CNO framework will be applied to two markedly different application testbeds: a large multi-site repository of neuroimaging, behavioral and genetic data for autism, and a focused clinical trial of functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Beyond the scientific goals, this award includes a three-pronged educational plan to build strong technical foundations, foster interdisciplinary collaborations through engagement and communication, and finally, motivate young women into the STEM fields. The investigators have outlined a comprehensive schedule of activities, ranging from curriculum development at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels, to organizing student networking events, to mentoring high school women through the Johns Hopkins Women in Science and Engineering outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, implantable neurostimulation (NS) devices have seen widespread adoption in the treatment of movement disorders, pain, and epilepsy, and have shown promise in treating psychiatric disorders, memory loss, depression, and more. Clinical neurostimulators have few channels and provide simple electrical pulses that are programmed by a doctor in a process that can take months or even years. There is a need for clinically viable, low-power and miniaturized systems that enable simultaneous stimulation and recording on many channels. Providing simultaneous sensing and closed-loop control will allow devices to automatically optimize parameters for a given outcome and only treat when symptoms are present, reducing side effects and reducing power. Closing the loop can provide dynamically delivered therapies that adjust electrical stimulation in response to a patient's real-time neural state. Furthermore, they will, for the first time, allow clinical researchers to understand the brain's response to stimulation and monitor changes (plasticity) over the long term. The future of medical care centers on wearable and implantable devices that will continuously monitor body functions and autonomously give treatment in an intelligent, closed-loop and well-controlled manner without the need for a doctor's intervention. This future requires broad, interdisciplinary engineering that combines electronics, artificial intelligence and biology. The multidisciplinary nature of this project extends to the long-term educational goals of promoting hands-on bioelectronic science and technology to the next generation of engineers. <br/> <br/><br/>This project develops miniaturized and highly integrated devices for closed-loop neuromodulation that combine high channel count neural recording with stimulation in a truly closed-loop manner for the first time. If successful, the proposed work will make significant advancements in two areas. First, low-power, low-noise integrated circuit design techniques will be developed to combine simultaneous stimulation and recording. Stimulation can significantly interfere with neural recording, resulting in large, persistent artifacts that mask or distort the neural signal and obscure reliable biomarker detection. Recording and stimulation circuits will be co-designed to eliminate this interaction. Second, online machine learning algorithms will be developed and integrated in hardware for dynamic closed-loop control. The emphasis will be to develop computationally efficient techniques that minimize the power consumption of the circuit. The two techniques will be combined into a single integrated circuit for multi-channel closed-loop neuromodulation that achieves a small footprint and ultra-low power dissipation that is safe for chronic use in humans. The device will be tested in animal models of disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inability to meet future food demands places more pressure on the one billion individuals currently underfed and living in substandard conditions throughout the world. These limitations will manifest into amplified social pressures such as, but not limited to, increased rates of disease, demand for land and water resources, and a lack of agricultural entrepreneurship, which only further weakens the global economy. A sustainable method (i.e., practical and economical) for remediating agricultural waste, while producing high value protein is essential to the long-term health of ecosystems and agriculture. One solution is the utilization of insect farming to convert organic wastes, which will potentially produce alternate resources of monetary value for the farmer. Insect farming can produce enormous amounts of protein and lipids that can be used in a variety of commodity settings (e.g., feed production, compost, biofuels, human food in some cases).  And this production of alternative protein sources is less environmentally straining than most currently used methods in terms of reduced land and water usage and reduced emissions.<br/><br/>The Center for Environmental Sustainability through Insect Farming (CESTIns) will be comprised of three sites (Texas A&M AgriLife Research [TAMU], Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis [IUPUI], and Mississippi State University [MSU]), with each site specializing in a specific area of research.  The purpose of the MSU site is to: 1) Investigate insect microbiomes to optimize, and to evaluate their utility for increased insect nutrition, nutrition as feed, and waste conversion; 2) Conduct experiments to determine effects of probiotic supplementation on insect nutrition, feed nutrition, and waste conversion; 3) Use classical and molecular microbiology to develop and implement management plans for quality assurance (prevention) and control (detection) of microbial pathogens.  MSU will work with the other sites to integrate research thrusts across the three sites with IUPUI and TAMU focusing on genetics, insect biology, and engineering and feed trials, respectively. Further, all three sites will work with strains produced by Industry as well as strains developed internally as a means to optimize mass production. Laboratory and field-based experiments will also engage interdisciplinary expertise in microbiology, engineering, chemistry, food nutrition, physiology, and vertebrate biology with cutting edge technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extensive reactions between the fracture fluid and surrounding rock lead to the production of helium, hydrogen, methane, short-chain hydrocarbons, oxidants and likely other compounds and to hypersalinity as non-hydrous silicates alter to clay in closed systems over time. Whether these deep Precambrian crust brines began as trapped ocean water and whether they contain microbial communities that have adapted to the increasing salinity over time is not known. Although such deep-seated, ancient brines are believed to be widespread, they have only been accessed in a few locations for scientific study. These principal investigators recently discovered hypersaline brines at 3 km depth in Moab Khotsong gold and uranium mine as part of an NSF/ICDP-supported project investigating a recent magnitude 5.5 earthquake. The brine salinity is 10x greater than any they have previously sampled in South Africa. Salinity also exceeds the known growth limit for methane-producing microbes. The methane-bearing gas, isotopic data, and fluid inclusions trapped in minerals suggest the brine could be at least 2 billion years old. This site is unique in the world in that it provides access to an ancient brine at high temperature (55 degree Centigrade). Researchers will analyze the chemistry of these unique subsurface brines, including the sources and amounts of gaseous energy sources and they will characterize the microbial communities in these ancient brines. If any extremophiles exist in these fractures, they will likely possess enzymes that will prove useful for remediating toxic metal- and radionuclide-contaminated water in the surface tailings ponds that are widespread in the mining districts of South Africa and elsewhere. If microbial life is absent in these fractures then they may provide a window into the abiotic processes responsible for the building blocks of life in the early Earth. <br/><br/>The investigators have characterized the microbial communities of deep brackish fracture water at nearby mines, which have revealed multi-tier syntrophic microbial communities that recycle biogenically produced CH4.  Halophilic methanogens and methanotrophs are not known and so either (1) other types of microbial C cycling must prevail here or (2) C cycling is limited to abiotic reactions. They successfully installed a packer/inconel U-tube into one hypersaline brine-filled fracture at 3.2 kmbls. and a steel valve on another at 3 kmbls., but increasing pressure and corrosion are causing both to leak. With the loss of key personnel at the end of the NSF/ICDP project, the collapse of the boreholes, and the loss of brine given their finite volume, researchers face losing an opportunity to sample a world class biogeochemical site. They therefore propose to return to Moab Khotsong Mine and with help from their South African colleagues to undertake a comprehensive survey and sampling of these brines and to take steps to secure longer-term access for future international researchers. They propose collecting sufficient biomass for metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and lipidomic analyses, gas for isotopic analyses and dating, and water for dissolved organic carbon characterization, as well as sealing and instrumenting other boreholes. The data provided by these brine samples will test the following hypotheses: 1) Life in the deeper, hotter, hypersaline fracture fluids is constrained by the energetic cost of combating intracellular water loss and an inventory of abiotic organic compounds formed by water/rock reactions over the past billions of years as well as biologically generated organic matter will be present and characterized for the first time; 2) Microbial communities present in cooler hypersaline fractures will be phylogenetically similar to phyla present in brackish fracture water and not related to the halophiles of existing surface saltpans; and 3) Biogenic CH4-supported communities found in brackish fluids will be replaced by communities supported by abiogenic hydrocarbons in hypersaline fluids, with greater expression of genes involved in osmotic regulation and with lipids whose composition provide lower membrane permeability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the collection and availability of massive data on IPSs, a significant challenge, faced by the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry is the capability to efficiently anticipate and avoid rare but catastrophic failure events. Developing an information structure that enables users to make the best use of massive data and to model the complexity and rarity of critical situations would contribute to addressing this challenge. This project investigates a novel, unsupervised rare-event learning framework for AV research that utilizes the collected data to assess and alleviate the risks, limitations, and failure modes of IPSs. The framework combines the flexibility in modeling high-dimensional time-series driving data via unsupervised learning algorithms, with the statistical robustness and computational efficiency from rare-event analysis. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the research include: 1) formulate an effective framework to extract safety-critical information from driving database; 2) develop a solid probabilistic measurement scheme for rare but adverse events in AV driving contexts; 3) disseminate the framework and research outcomes to industry and government units in urgent need of reliable evaluation and development methods; and 4) cross-fertilize research thrusts between the academic communities of rare-event estimation and the study of IPSs. The research will merge high-fidelity driving representations learned from data and statistically rigorous rare event analysis so that AV design evaluation in simulated complex driving situations will become highly efficient. It will synthesize machine learning with simulation methodologies, including rare-event analysis, stochastic optimization, and particle methods to boost the performances of state-of-the-art algorithms. The project will foster transformative academic cross-fertilization between researchers in rare-event estimation (operations research) and IPSs (machine learning/robotics), by disseminating the outcomes in top-tier journals, conferences, tutorials and invited seminars.

Each objective leverages insights and methods established through past energy-water nexus work by the Principal Investigator (PI). The project will build a foundation for the PI's long-term goal of creating more robust, adaptive, and sustainable power systems by coordinating the behavior of power suppliers and power consumers through market structures and automation to maximize the power sector's environmental sustainability, resilience to disruption, and efficiency.<br/><br/>This CAREER project utilizes physics-based modeling techniques to build a statistical framework that offers probabilistic insight into how climate change might affect the operation and environmental externalities of the power sector across a continuum of historical through extreme climate change projections. Frameworks are designed to compare conventional and emerging supply-side and demand-side resources through the lens of the challenges imposed by future warming. In the energy sector, the knowledge developed through this CAREER project promises to be an important step to enable new methodologies to inform and assess tradeoffs for electric infrastructure build-outs, DSM interventions, future electricity market structures, and real-time pricing strategies that consider regional and environmental conditions (rather than reliability and cost alone). The project's generalized statistical framework could also be applied to assess how other critical infrastructures, such as water, agricultural and transportation systems, vary in terms of their climate vulnerability, mitigation, and adaptation tradeoffs. This framework also allows analysts to present stakeholders with anticipated performance tradeoffs across a probabilistic distribution of climate conditions, rather than a single projection that might be contentious in some stakeholder groups. Annual outreach events leveraging the PI's role as a Resident Faculty at USC will connect underserved K-12 groups with freshmen in the PI's dormitory, creating a spirit of mentorship, while empowering underserved minorities with the knowledge to advocate for their own environmental justice. These events will utilize the Parkside Interactive Sustainability Laboratory, a community gardening space built by the PI to introduce students to sustainability through activity-based environmental programming. The themes, data, and models generated through this project will be incorporated into the PI's existing undergraduate and graduate classes, where students will be challenged to create web-based educational content for younger students to facilitate knowledge sharing. In the broader context, drought and heatwaves have already prompted significant power curtailments across the world. Considering that installed generation capacity is projected to grow by 140% globally by 2040, generalized frameworks to improve and protect the performance of the power grid within the context of regional climate will be critical for making wise investment decisions.

Grass lawns are ubiquitous in the continental US covering an estimated 40 million acres of land, an area more than three times that of any other crop, including corn, soy and wheat. While grass lawns are beloved by American landowners, they are expensive, requiring more water, pesticide and fertilizer inputs than any other crop. These inputs degrade waterways and create biological deserts. In response, there is a growing call for sustainable lawn alternatives with an emphasis on native wildflower meadows. Despite the demand for meadowscapes, grass only turf continues to dominate the US landscape, in part, because the United States (US) does not have dependable, effective tools for meadow establishment. Introduction of wildflower sod/turf products to the US market will contribute to desired societal outcomes; such as meeting objectives mandated by state and federal water quality policies and initiatives, increasing biodiversity and helping ensure the health of pollinating insect communities, which provide food security through the pollination of wild and cultivated crops. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will advance the teams knowledge of potential barriers to widespread adoption of wildflower meadows. While the ecological benefits of wildflower meadows are fairly well understood, few studies have investigated meadow implementation from the perspective of land managers, landscape professionals and communities. Understanding the market obstacles of replacing high input lawns with sustainable flowering meadows is the first step in finding viable solutions. The technology being pursued is a biodiverse meadow sod comprised of native grasses and wildflowers. Conceptually, it is similar to traditional sod in that the turf is moveable and easy to install. The US team has partnered with a UK company which developed the production system on which the new technology is based, and has been the leading supplier of wildflower turf in Great Britain since 2003. The new IP will include adapting the UK growing system to 1) work with US plant species and climates, and 2) development of native seed mixes that grow well in the production system and that will provide the desired aesthetics for an urban setting<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first iteration of the technology will be in the form of recommendations made to drivers to affect velocity at different points along a route.  With the recent advancement to autonomous driver system implementation, this technology can be applied by directly interconnecting with the automated control systems rather than working through driver recommendations.  The safety of highways and all roadways will be enhanced with the system to recommend a maximum velocity prior to reaching road curves, preventing tipping and sliding.  Furthermore, less maintenance and longer lasting parts on vehicles such as brake replacements, tire replacements, and engine and transmission work will be needed.  This will benefit all of society in the form of reduced transportation cost.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is the result of studies done in the field of control systems. Specifically, control systems which optimize velocity to minimize energy consumption over a driving route through the implementation of dynamic programming.  The technology uses vehicle characteristics such as mass, air drag coefficients, and motor efficiency, as well as altitude and heading to determine the speed profile which is a minimum for a given route, while still adhering to local speed laws.  The technical results which the project is based stems from simulations done in Matlab concerning all these parameters in different situations and environments.  The initial simulations have shown a 16% energy saving for city driving in a scenario.  The amount of energy saving will be highly situational and will likely vary widely depending on the vehicle studied and circumstances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different types of these cells are located in a part of the brain called the striatum, where they are intermixed together. New molecular genetic tools will be used to isolate and characterize the sets of proteins (proteome) of these different striatal neuron types across development, and to track changes in the proteomes of these neurons in response to changes in the incoming information that they receive. Based on this work, new, genetically-modified mouse lines will be generated that will allow members of the wider scientific community to pursue proteomic studies with other cell types in both the brain and the body. A major educational goal involves the development of an enrichment course on imaging neuronal proteins for freshman in a Chicago public high school. Imaging offers young science students an intuitive way to learn about cell biology and cell function. This project will yield deep insights into the development of the striatum, and the ways in which brain circuit activity changes brain circuit function. The tools and analysis systems established by this project will be of broad use in diverse areas of developmental and cellular biology.<br/><br/>There are few existing techniques for genetically-targeted proteomic studies within native neural circuits that preserve the cellular context of the neurons being studied. This proposal introduces a powerful suite of techniques for unlocking the proteome of any cell type in the brain or in the body. The approach leverages the power of peroxidases, enzymes that can be induced to biotinylate neighboring proteins. This approach is based on the development and application of a new set of flexible recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) that conditionally express a modified peroxidase throughout the cytosol or targeted to neuronal cell sub-compartments. These techniques will be used to address a critical question in neurobiology concerning the development and use-dependent neuromodulation of cell types in the striatum. In addition, new conditional proteomic reporter mouse lines will be created and made available to the scientific community that will have a lasting impact by enabling a new generation of proteomic studies of neurons, glia, and non-neuronal cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These have included both thoroughgoing legislative reforms and specific banking sector reorganizations. Now, a decade later, the research supported by this award asks an important question: how have these changes affected the day-to-day practices and values of those working in finance?  Unlike most research on finance, this ethnographic project is focused on the local and the micro-processes through which global change must occur. This is a critically important and often missing perspective. In some locales the banking crisis has persisted. Understanding the motivations and activities of those who actually practice finance is a key part of identifying the underpinnings of financial resilience and avoiding future crises.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted by Yale University anthropology doctoral student, Theodore Park, with the guidance of Dr. Paul Kockelman. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research in northern Italy because it is one site where the financial crisis has continued, despite targeted legislation, and because Italian reforms are sometimes identified as potential models for reforms in the United States. The researcher will collect data with a comparative research design, focusing on two wealth management firms, one of which has chosen to adopt the reforms and become publicly traded, and one of which has chosen to sustain its earlier identity as a local, private institution. The researcher will focus on the effects of variable institutional structures; the impacts of legislation, particularly the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; and variation in ethical discourse and practices. Study populations will include wealth managers, fund managers, support staff, clients, and family members. Data will be collected through a mix of ethnographic methods including participant observations, semi-structured interviews, life history mappings, surveys, and focus groups. These data will be supplemented with archival research; compilations of relevant legislation; and analyses of media, including manager training materials and social media. Findings from this research will be shared with policy makers, the institutions studied, and the general public. The research also will contribute to improved theory of the social science of financial institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inability to meet future food demands places more pressure on the one billion individuals currently underfed and living in substandard conditions throughout the world. These limitations will manifest into amplified social pressures such as, but not limited to, increased rates of disease, demand for land and water resources, and a lack of agricultural entrepreneurship, which only further weakens the global economy. A sustainable method (i.e., practical and economical) for remediating agricultural waste, while producing high value protein is essential to the long-term health of ecosystems and agriculture. One solution is the utilization of insect farming to convert organic wastes, which will potentially produce alternate resources of monetary value for the farmer. Insect farming can produce enormous amounts of protein and lipids that can be used in a variety of commodity settings (e.g., feed production, compost, biofuels, human food in some cases).  And this production of alternative protein sources is less environmentally straining than most currently used methods in terms of reduced land and water usage and reduced emissions.<br/><br/>The Center for Environmental Sustainability through Insect Farming (CESTIns) will be comprised of three sites (Texas A&M AgriLife Research [TAMU], Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis [IUPUI], and Mississippi State University [MSU]), with each site specializing in a specific area of research.  The purpose of the TAMU site is to, 1) investigate basic parameters of insect biology to optimize industrialized production, 2) work with engineering to develop equipment needed for insect mass production, and 3) conduct feed trials for using insect protein as feed for livestock as well as people. TAMU will work with the other sites to integrate research thrusts across the three sites with IUPUI and MSU focusing on genetics and microbiology/quality assurance, respectively. Further, all three sites will work with strains produced by Industry as well as strains developed internally as a means to optimize mass production. Laboratory and field-based experiments will also engage interdisciplinary expertise in microbiology, engineering, chemistry, food nutrition, physiology, and vertebrate biology with cutting edge technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will provide scholarships to transfer students from rural community colleges who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Computer and Information Systems, Cyber-Forensics and Information Security, and Data Analytics. Low-income transfer students who are underrepresented in the computing fields such as females, residents of rural southwestern Pennsylvania, minorities, and first-generation college students will receive two-year scholarships for their third and fourth year of study.  The project aims to recruit, retain, graduate, and place these students in STEM careers in the Pittsburgh region or graduate schools nationwide by implementing and studying directed support strategies. These strategies include a new orientation course for STEM transfer students, a project-based faculty-student mentorship program, service learning opportunities, active learning education, and career development and placement activities.

Robust, self-improving strategy for robot navigation will benefit several industries such as commercial and non-commercial transportation, large-scale infrastructure inspection, industrial warehousing, disaster response, and assistive robotics.  The main challenge to robust navigation lies in developing the ability to navigate unstructured, dynamic environments for which there may be insufficient data collected for training machine learning methods, and for which model-based reasoning is too complex. A purely learning-based strategy fails to have operational guarantees (i.e., collision avoidance is not guaranteed). The research proposes a mixed method solution whereby physics-based reasoning and machine learning work together to resolve the unstructured navigation problem. The combined approach will lead to a cognizant and reflective navigation pipeline whose performance improves with time. A central claim of this project is that the learning module will act as an efficient multi-hypothesis generator for potential navigation decisions, for which options can be processed, scored, and confirmed by the physics-based component.  The learning system will subsequently use these scores for online improvement. The net result will be mobile robots that are cognizant of their operation and adaptable to new information gained during task execution. <br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to derive a safe autonomous navigation framework for general settings through the use of a viewer-centric processing paradigm capable of leveraging learning and model driven methods to overcome the limitations of entirely object-centric approaches to navigation.  Appealing to Marr's framework for visual processing, the project investigates a viewer-centric approach to navigation.  By more tightly linking perceptual and planning representations through the viewer-centric approach, the new approach leverages measurements obtained during navigation to provide online assessment for improving performance and generating knowledge regarding navigation through unknown scenes. The project investigates the effect of a viewer-centric model representation for use in local planning, as well as the connection of such representations to reflective, experiential machine learning for improved performance that leverage the model-based planning subcomponent.  The research involves meeting the following objectives: 1) Confirming the robustness of a viewer-centric navigation framework combining model-based and deep learning-based approaches for safe navigation with cognizant and adaptive operation; 2) Demonstrating enhanced reasoning through scene-selective strategies that improve through experience; and 3) Extending the framework to dynamic scenes through learned models for the relative physics of motion, whereby moving objects are modeled in the viewer's frame of reference to detect dangerous relative motion profiles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advent of CRISPR/Cas technology has provided a great advance in our ability to engineer genomes, but barriers remain to the routine employment of these methods in the most important agricultural species. This project, in collaboration with Dr. Christopher West, University of Leeds, UK, addresses the most significant problem in engineering crop plants, that genome modification is associated with untargeted and potentially mutagenic integration of the machinery used to edit the genome. This is problematic because of the increased screening required to identify targeted transformants against the high background of random integrations. In addition, for commercial use the synthetic constructs must be eliminated from the genome in a process that can be lengthy and expensive for many crops, especially those with long generation times (such as tree species) and those propagated vegetatively (such as potato, sweet potato, banana, etc.). This project, informed by the applicants' considerable experience in plant transformation and DNA recombination mechanisms, will develop a clean genetic engineering methodology based on the suppression of random transgene integration. <br/><br/>Most current plant genome engineering technology platforms require, or have as an unintended consequence, the integration of introduced genome engineering reagents into the host chromosomes.  The technology that will be tested in this project builds on the identification of a DNA Polymerase Theta (PolQ)-mediated pathway that is responsible for the majority of Agrobacterium-mediated transgene integration events. Suppression of this pathway, using dominant negative fragments of DNA polymerase theta introduced into the plant either as expressible T-DNA-encoded genes or directly as peptides, will mitigate T-DNA integration into the host genome. Inhibition of ectopic T-DNA integration will enhance the ability to detect gene targeting events mediated by homology-dependent repair.  Proof of principle will be provided in Arabidopsis through targeted mutation of the ABI1 gene through homology-directed repair, resulting in the production of a dominant mutation that allows germination in the presence of abscisic acid. This work will be extended to Brassica to demonstrate the application of this technology to crop species. This project will significantly advance our ability to engineer crop genomes using a knowledge-based approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organisms, which live in surface ocean waters, require sunlight and nutrients to grow and reproduce. In the oceans around Antarctica, nitrate (NO3-) as a nutrient source of nitrogen (N) is usually abundant while the nutrient iron is often sparse. Light availability also changes from complete darkness to 24 hours of constant sunlight, as well as from low light deeper in the water column to high, stressful light at the ocean surface. As a consequence, the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean often live in a suboptimal environment in which conditions for growth are frequently changing. Scientists understand that nutrient supply and light availability affect these organisms and that these organisms, in turn, can alter the chemical composition of the seawater. For example, nitrate can occur in different forms, including a lighter (14N) and heavier (15N) form of NO3-, depending on which stable isotope of N is present in the molecule. Phytoplankton prefer to use the lighter isotope during uptake and incorporation into biomass, though the ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton has been shown to vary depending on environmental conditions. Notably, the isotope ratio used by phytoplankton is recorded in sediments and can be used to determine both the historic composition of ocean waters and the productivity of phytoplankton. This project will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress change the isotopic ratios of water column nitrate- in specific ways. A combination of laboratory culture and field experiments will be conducted. Cultures of important Southern Ocean phytoplankton species will be grown under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions where ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton, physiological changes, and molecular markers of iron and light stress and nitrate assimilation will be measured. Similar measurements will be done in shipboard experiments on a cruise in the Southern Ocean with South African colleagues. These data will increase our understanding of past and present productivity in the Southern Ocean, and how phytoplankton changed the chemical composition of the seawater. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the STEM field and graduate students from Florida State University and Old Dominion University as well as students from South Africa will collaborate on this project. The improved process understanding of the N isotope effect will be presented not only at scientific national and international conferences but also during local outreach events at local K12 schools.<br/><br/>Interpretation of both modern water column nitrate (NO3-) isotopic ratio (d15N) measurements generated by GEOTRACES and other cruises, as well as metrics of paleo-nutrient utilization, depend upon a mechanistic understanding of the degree to which NO3- assimilation by phytoplankton discriminates against the heavier isotope, 15NO3- (NO3- assimilation epsilon). We currently lack the ability to predict how iron and light stress impacts the NO3- assimilation epsilon. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress elevates the epsilon for NO3-assimilation. This hypothesis will be tested by a combination of laboratory culture work and field work on a cruise of opportunity in the Southern Ocean. Mesocosm experiments will include both increasing and alleviating light and/or iron stress on monoclonal phytoplankton cultures and in natural phytoplankton communities while measuring the response of the NO3- assimilation epsilon. Water column samples will be collected on the cruise for analysis of dissolved and size-fractionated particulate N concentration and d15N, as well as phytoplankton community composition, photophysiology and gene expression markers of iron and light stress and NO3- assimilation. In particular, the expression of iron and light stress markers will be used to evaluate the relative contribution of iron and light stress to field-based estimates of the NO3-- assimilation epsilon. The results from these field measurements, together with lab-based culture studies, will be used to constrain the range of the epsilon for NO3- assimilation under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions, including the potential alleviation of iron stress as has been hypothesized to have occurred during the last glacial maximum (a.k.a. the Martin hypothesis).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2011 AAAS publication, ""Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action,"" provides comprehensive guidelines for content, skills, and teaching practices that are still considered the ""gold standard"" for undergraduate life sciences education. The Southeast Region of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (SERP) will host a professional development institute on the campus of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University in summer 2019, with a follow-up event hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists in spring 2020. The Institute will engage sixteen teams in a virtuous cycle of assessment and reforms based on the recommendations in ""Vision and Change."" Teams will include representatives from all institution types, from community colleges to research-intensive universities, as well as significant representation of Minority Serving Institutions. Institutional teams will be comprised of both faculty and administrators to ensure representation of both grassroots and institutional stakeholders.<br/><br/>The project has two primary objectives: (1) to develop a network of life sciences departments engaged in a cycle of continual improvement; and (2) to conduct an evidence-based assessment of a systems model for undergraduate life sciences reform. The Institute will employ a strategy of shared-visioning, which requires substantial communication, learning, and collaboration among all stakeholders. The agenda is designed to help teams build a common language to enable discussion of important issues (e.g., course-embedded research, metacognition, etc.), identify shared priorities for improvement at the level of faculty, department, and institution, and draft an action plan for short-term and long-term reform efforts. By focusing on department-level transformation, the project builds capacity for long-term systemic changes to educational practice and improved student learning. Because public dissemination and formative assessment of these efforts are critical to validating team efforts and as providing accountability for institutional teams, a follow-up event will be held in conjunction with the 2020 meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists. All teams will make a public poster presentation of their action plan, efforts to date, and initial assessment results. A separate workshop during the ASB meeting will be used to collect more detailed assessment data from each team, as well as provide time for inter-team sharing of successes and challenges. Finally, a public workshop will be conducted to introduce the general ASB membership to the recommendations of ""Vision and Change.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project can not only advance metabolomics, but also enhance related fields.  Tandem mass spectrometry, MS/MS, is a generally used approach, so a range of fields can benefit from improved identification performance, and may be applied to other systems. Moreover, successfully applying graph grammar to solve the graph theory problem in metabolomics will provide support to other scientists who also use graphs to address their research problems by adopting graph grammar methods.  A clear focus of this project is to involve undergraduate students in computational research, with the aspects of the overall research project designed at an appropriate level.<br/><br/>The specific research objectives of this project is to (1) convert the problem of analyzing MS/MS data into a graph theory problem, (2) use graph grammar and statistical methods to investigate fragmentation rules, and (3) integrate these rules into an identification tool, MIDAS-G. Graph grammar can flexibly represent and process adjacent structures. By taking advantage of its high level for interpretation, graph grammar can work with statistical methods for explicitly investigating fragmentation rules from annotated MS/MS data. These learned rules will in turn be integrated into the identification tool and algorithms will be designed to enable the tool to identify metabolites efficiently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, lack of documented evidence of their performance during an earthquake still limits their widespread adoption. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will study the effects of the November 30, 2018, earthquake (magnitude 7.0) in Anchorage, Alaska, on the performance of EBFRP composite retrofits in reinforced concrete buildings. The 2018 earthquake, which impacted the same region that was severely damaged by the 1964 Great Alaskan earthquake (magnitude 9.2) ground shaking, provides an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of EBFRP retrofits in a high-intensity earthquake and learn about their performance. This study will, for the first time, provide information on the performance of EBFRP retrofitted structures in an earthquake that occurred in the United States. The collected data will contribute to improved building retrofit design standards and construction practices, which will cultivate safe buildings and communities resilient to earthquakes, thus promoting national welfare. The findings will benefit practitioners and researchers by providing a unique data set to benchmark the numerical models used to simulate the response of retrofitted structures. The data will be archived and disseminated through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot and Reconnaissance Integration Portal (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). The graduate student participating in the project will gain valuable research raining in field data collection and post-earthquake reconnaissance.

Extensive reactions between the fracture fluid and surrounding rock lead to the production of helium, hydrogen, methane, short-chain hydrocarbons, oxidants and likely other compounds and to hypersalinity as non-hydrous silicates alter to clay in closed systems over time. Whether these deep Precambrian crust brines began as trapped ocean water and whether they contain microbial communities that have adapted to the increasing salinity over time is not known. Although such deep-seated, ancient brines are believed to be widespread, they have only been accessed in a few locations for scientific study. These principal investigators recently discovered hypersaline brines at 3 km depth in Moab Khotsong gold and uranium mine as part of an NSF/ICDP-supported project investigating a recent magnitude 5.5 earthquake. The brine salinity is 10x greater than any they have previously sampled in South Africa. Salinity also exceeds the known growth limit for methane-producing microbes. The methane-bearing gas, isotopic data, and fluid inclusions trapped in minerals suggest the brine could be at least 2 billion years old. This site is unique in the world in that it provides access to an ancient brine at high temperature (55 degree Centigrade). Researchers will analyze the chemistry of these unique subsurface brines, including the sources and amounts of gaseous energy sources and they will characterize the microbial communities in these ancient brines. If any extremophiles exist in these fractures, they will likely possess enzymes that will prove useful for remediating toxic metal- and radionuclide-contaminated water in the surface tailings ponds that are widespread in the mining districts of South Africa and elsewhere. If microbial life is absent in these fractures then they may provide a window into the abiotic processes responsible for the building blocks of life in the early Earth. <br/><br/>The investigators have characterized the microbial communities of deep brackish fracture water at nearby mines, which have revealed multi-tier syntrophic microbial communities that recycle biogenically produced CH4.  Halophilic methanogens and methanotrophs are not known and so either (1) other types of microbial C cycling must prevail here or (2) C cycling is limited to abiotic reactions. They successfully installed a packer/inconel U-tube into one hypersaline brine-filled fracture at 3.2 kmbls. and a steel valve on another at 3 kmbls., but increasing pressure and corrosion are causing both to leak. With the loss of key personnel at the end of the NSF/ICDP project, the collapse of the boreholes, and the loss of brine given their finite volume, researchers face losing an opportunity to sample a world class biogeochemical site. They therefore propose to return to Moab Khotsong Mine and with help from their South African colleagues to undertake a comprehensive survey and sampling of these brines and to take steps to secure longer-term access for future international researchers. They propose collecting sufficient biomass for metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and lipidomic analyses, gas for isotopic analyses and dating, and water for dissolved organic carbon characterization, as well as sealing and instrumenting other boreholes. The data provided by these brine samples will test the following hypotheses: 1) Life in the deeper, hotter, hypersaline fracture fluids is constrained by the energetic cost of combating intracellular water loss and an inventory of abiotic organic compounds formed by water/rock reactions over the past billions of years as well as biologically generated organic matter will be present and characterized for the first time; 2) Microbial communities present in cooler hypersaline fractures will be phylogenetically similar to phyla present in brackish fracture water and not related to the halophiles of existing surface saltpans; and 3) Biogenic CH4-supported communities found in brackish fluids will be replaced by communities supported by abiogenic hydrocarbons in hypersaline fluids, with greater expression of genes involved in osmotic regulation and with lipids whose composition provide lower membrane permeability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principles of engineering and oceanography can be used to maximize the impact of a network of marine robots, but because fisheries managers, oceanographers, and roboticists have different perspectives and knowledge bases, it can be difficult to take advantage of cutting-edge research in each field without significant effort to translate among the groups. Researchers will develop a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. The system will be designed with input from fisheries managers through a series of workshops, and will be field-tested at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia.  The research will lead to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, as well as breakthroughs in key areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Many of the results will be applicable to other smart and autonomous systems in challenging environments.  In addition, the project will train graduate students and broaden undergraduate education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and offer a number of outreach activities, including working with the University of Georgia Marine Extension service to develop a summer camp for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The project is focused on developing an intelligent physical system (IPS) that consists of a heterogeneous fleet of marine robots, cooperatively tracking fish movement and surveying the habitat with minimum request for human intervention. The IPS will translate the human-specified missions of fisheries managers into goal-driven task designs for each robot, and automatically generate executable plans for the networked mobile sensing agents. The system will autonomously and persistently collect in-situ measurements and acoustic detections of fish species while maintaining multi-scale data streams and constructing multiple spatial-temporal maps reflecting the conditions of the ecosystem. The research aims to discover the hotspots (e.g., spatial locations with sustained congregations of fish), as well as illuminate more information about how and when fish move among these hotspots. This goal is quite challenging due to a number of gaps between project needs and the state-of-art autonomy research. Researchers will address the challenges through new developments that accomplish three main tasks: (1) Developing the goal-driven marine autonomy for fish habitat survey, (2) realizing the goal-driven autonomy on physical systems, and (3) evaluating the developed framework through real-life field work, experiments, and data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new methods are important since many areas of the world are aseismic and controlled man-made seismic sources are expensive. So new ways to use existing nonseismic signals, called ambient noise, to image the Earth can be used in many places, such as the Midwest. Twelve portable seismic stations will be deployed centered on the Earthscope seismic station SFIN over a several month period. These methods will then be applied to selected seismic stations in the upper part of the central Midwest with similar ambient noise characteristics to test the consistency of the approach and image a stretch of the crust from Iowa to Ohio. They will compare this work by doing the same for a the recent ""Large-N"" IRIS Community Wavefield Demonstration Experiment in Oklahoma. Since the Oklahoma array is comparable in aperture to the small-scale array at SFIN, the relative performance of the two arrays will be compared. The broader impacts of the proposal come from improvements in the methodology and implementation of ambient seismic noise technologies and extending these to seismic body-wave imaging. Utilizing the deployed seismic stations, K-12 activities and displays will be developed to engage younger students with recent new developments in seismology, including the recording of ambient seismic noise and P-wave coda from earthquakes.<br/><br/>Seismic interferometry for body-waves is studied for crustal reflectivity using autocorrelations of ambient noise and the P-wave coda from earthquakes. The autocorrelation stacks of ambient noise results in virtually coincident sources and receivers and effective zero-offset reflection seismic traces. The influence of the ambient noise distribution on the autocorrelation stacks can be approximately estimated using polarization analysis on single three-component stations, but a more comprehensive analysis can be done using beamforming from a small seismic array. Twelve portable seismic stations will be deployed over a 10-km spiral-arm array configuration centered on the Earthscope seismic station SFIN over a several month period, and beamforming will be performed to estimate the regional illumination distribution of the autocorrelated ambient noise signals to obtain illumination corrections. These will then be applied to selected seismic stations in the upper part of the central Midwest with similar ambient noise characteristics to test the consistency of the approach and to obtain an effective zero-offset linear section of crustal reflectivity. Several autocorrelation techniques are investigated to provide higher resolution estimates of crustal reflectivity, including tuned temporal and frequency normalizations, phase correlations, and time-frequency phase weighted stacks of the correlated ambient noise. Correlated P-wave coda of regional and teleseismic earthquakes are also investigated, where stacking over events are used to reduce the effects of source side scattering to better image the receiver side crust.

This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare.

They are responsible for numerous volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as the recent Anchorage earthquake. Important dynamical processes take place in between the two converging plates, such as the buoyant rising of molten mantle rock below volcanoes. Seismology offers a direct way to image the convective zones of subduction, which are between 30 km and 200 km deep. Seismometers installed in the field record seismic waves from earthquakes occurring in the down going plate and all over the world. By modeling the wave forms and timing, using techniques like those used in medical ultrasound imaging, images of the subduction zone can be obtained. Here, the project team will install more than 300 seismometers above the Alaska subduction zone. It will take advantage of the seismic waves produced by the ongoing aftershocks from the Anchorage earthquake to image at high resolution the subsurface structures. This project will also test the imaging capabilities of the timely deployment of dense networks of small seismometers, a new approach in seismology. It will provide critical constraints for models of subduction zone dynamics and associated hazards, as well as field experience to seven students in seismology. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will support the deployment of 306 seismometers (three-component nodal sensors) to image the Alaska subduction zone at an unprecedented resolution.  It will take advantage of the active local seismicity enhanced by the aftershocks of the 2018 magnitude-7 Anchorage earthquake. Recent results from Cascadia indicate that ambient noise and teleseism body waves can be used to image crustal structure. Here, local seismicity will be used to image the mantle wedge and crustal structure. Distant earthquakes will be used to image subsurface discontinuities, such as the crustal thickness and the subducting slab. Surface waves from ambient noise will be used to characterize the shallow crustal structure. This should allow resolving at km-scale the structural complexity within the mantle wedge between the subducting Pacific plate and the overlying North American crust. Furthermore, by leveraging an ongoing smaller-scale project focused on the Denali fault, this work will allow the simultaneous characterization of small-scale fault zone structures and broader crustal contrasts across the fault. Higher resolution images will provide important constraints for models seeking to understand the dynamics of subduction zones. The project is led by three early-career scientists and will involve seven students in seismology for the field deployment and recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enabling this heightened level of sensing has the potential to revolutionize greater understanding of the surrounding environment and the ability to further optimize efficient operation of homes and businesses.  It will also provide early detection of potentially hazardous situations and enable better quality of life for an aging population.  As the number and density of connected devices have increased, electromagnetic spectrum at widely used frequency bands of 5 GHz and below has become increasingly crowded and congested.  At the same time, reducing the power consumption and physical size of each individual sensor node is important to keep the network hardware unobtrusive and more easily deployable. This project seeks to bridge the power and size gap by enabling resource-aware wireless communication network with energy harvesting sensor nodes where available energy can have immense variation and utilize higher frequency spectrum at 24 GHz.  The reconfigurable transceivers of network sensor nodes will be capable of maintaining critical services when available power is scarce while taking advantage of higher power levels when power is abundant, with automatically adaptable roles within the greater network based upon how that available power is distributed.  This project also includes several educational activities such as STEM workshops for K-12 students, research experiences for undergraduates, and course development.  An entrepreneurial seminar and site visit series with local startup companies will provide real examples for undergraduate and graduate students to learn how to transform laboratory ideas to real-world applications while benefiting their local communities.<br/><br/>The project will investigate fundamental challenges at several layers in the hardware hierarchy of wireless sensor network.  These will range from link and network considerations, such as adapting the link requirements based on node- or network-level power availability, down to reconfigurable transceiver blocks that enable higher level functionality in physical layer.  These transceiver blocks include multi-mode receivers that can dynamically trade off power for data rate or sensitivity in real time as well as transmitters that are highly efficient even at significant back-off power levels.  Additionally, the project will push ultra-low power wireless operation to higher frequencies in K-band (e.g., 24 GHz), which alleviates the issue of limited spectrum at lower frequencies, while also allowing for drastically reduced antenna size with the same efficiency. The project will also advance the co-design between the radio electronics and the electromagnetics including impedance matching networks and antennas engineered for low-power, high-frequency, high-impedance conditions.  The fundamental studies and underlying design principles developed in this project will be demonstrated with proof-of-concept wireless sensor nodes.  This project will also advance the implementation of dynamically asymmetric links and role selection in a mesh network of symmetric wireless sensor nodes to optimize the network functionality based on available power.  The research has important impacts because it will bring together traditionally siloed design spaces, and leverage fundamental research within RF, ultra-low power circuits, and antenna design to address critical bottlenecks in deployment of future wireless sensor networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fuel cell technologies are a solution that has the potential to transform transportation industry with zero tailpipe emissions like electric cars, but with mileage range similar to gasoline and diesel fuel.  Additionally, stationary fuel cells can provide a zero emission electricity source.  Developing a viable system to convert organic waste into renewable hydrogen in a modular, decentralized fashion can be a paradigm changer for hydrogen supply and the fuel cell market while solving additional societal issues surrounding food waste and fossil fuel emissions. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to develop a modular microbial electrolysis stack system capable of continuous high-rate hydrogen production from food waste. The innovation is based on electron or electricity producing bacteria, which generate current from organic waste and a device that Electro-Active has developed to enable high-rate hydrogen production from that current. It incorporates optimized reactor design and operation to sustain productivities typically seen only with pure substrates. To demonstrate proof-of-concept for this technology, target productivities and price point must be demonstrated in a larger reactor unit over a longer period of time. Sustained performance requires high-rate biocatalytic conversion of feedstock, and high-rate proton transport to the cathode. To overcome these challenges, a patented microbial enrichment process has been created to develop a robust microbial community capable of converting complex waste into electrons at high rates and efficiency. Additionally, preliminary data with robust biocatalyst, novel reactor design and operation provides evidence that the integrated approach can overcome these limitations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is focused on creating and testing an architecture for a robot that allows the system to be adaptable and ethical in its decision-making in complex situations. Since these systems may be called upon to adapt to evolving norms and cultural expectations, the development of an architecture that incorporates a range of philosophical theories and perspectives is crucially important. The robot's decisions will therefore be guided by multiple ethical frameworks and a simulated moral emotional state when they are tasked with making an ethical choice. Findings from the project could influence the design of countless types of robots including robot teachers, greeters, therapists, and companions. Thus, this research has the potential to impact large sections of society, including vulnerable populations such as individuals with disabilities that may interact with future robots. <br/> <br/>The different underlying computational architectures will be expanded to reason in multiple ways according to different ethical frameworks; the selection of the framework and resulting action will depend upon the moral emotional state of the agent. Moral emotions can help to guide decision making when conflicting choices are available as recommended by competing or cooperating ethical frameworks.  The robot models the human subject's moral emotional state to choose an ethical action (from a set of competing actions derived from different ethical frameworks)  to select an action that best conforms to the human's expectations, existing biases, and the situational context itself. Thus, the researchers will develop an action selection mechanism that recognizes the moral emotional state of the overall situation, and use it as a means for selecting the appropriate ethical action to undertake in the face of conflicting choices. Specifically this research will investigate the appropriateness of the application of other-deception (deception intended to benefit the human being deceived by the robot)  dependent upon the subject?s emotional state (e.g., shame, embarrassment, guilt, or empathy) and the specific task context to determine whether to have the robot deceive the subject or not based on these conditions.The plan is to encode ethical frameworks, such as Kantianism, Utilitarianism, and W.D. Ross?s moral duties, that will serve as a basis for a robot?s decision-making.  Moral emotions will help guide the robot towards the selection of which ethical framework should take dominance for a particular situation and individuals involved.  The approach will be tested in two main scenarios dealing with practical ethical decisions.  First, a robot playing a game with a child and the role of other-deception for losing on purpose based on the perceived emotional state of the child.  Second, a robot interacting with older adults who are performing tasks such as pill sorting and whether the robot should seek to reduce frustration to facilitate training with a potential trade-off on safety.  A key goal is to have the robot reproduce an average human ethical choice and/or a choice that reflects the consensus of ethical experts where available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there has been considerable progress made in basic understanding of various failure mechanisms, e.g. brittle fracture, strain localization, and ductile flow, the recent advancements in experimental techniques, such as digital image correlation and micro-computed tomography imaging, have led to an influx of data on failure that is not always easy to incorporate into models manually. The current effort leverages the AI's ability to repeatedly generate and test hypotheses such that it can self-identify and discover mistakes in previous modeling efforts and identify new physics too subtle or difficult to identify and interpret manually. These computer-generated discoveries will be a powerful tool in accelerating the progress of science. By understanding how failures of materials and structures occur, the research will advance national prosperity and welfare by helping engineers making more efficient, robust and precise designs-by-analyses for infrastructure, structural components and devices. As part of the grant, the PI will also facilitate mentoring relationships with selected underrepresented high school students and high school teachers in the Harlem district of New York City to enable future generations of engineers and scientists in leveraging the opportunities afforded by AI. <br/><br/>A new meta-modeling paradigm is planned to adaptively generate models to capture the effects of evolving microstructures due to micro-cracks, plastic slip, and wear at sub-scales, and then to recursively upscale responses to the scale of interest. By conceptualizing a constitutive law (theoretical or data-driven) as a directed multi-graph, i.e. a flow network of information, we idealize the process of writing a constitutive law as a combination of actions operated on the directed multi-graph. With a reward function defined as a function of accuracy, robustness, speed, and consistency, we then invent a game whose goal is to maximize the rewards with finite actions (e.g. shape of yield surface, hardening rules, damage, nonlocality, refinement criterion) against constraints (e.g. material-frame indifference, thermodynamic laws). This technique is then applied in hierarchical and concurrent multiscale coupling models. In the hierarchical models, hybridized machine learning models can be used as a surrogate to bridge scales. In the concurrent model, a multi-phase field model is used to enable several types of models (theoretical, data-driven, hybridized, homogenization-from sub-scale-simulations) to be deployed at different domains of interests (e.g. crack tip, shear band) to yield the most accurate simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Raman spectroscopy and microscopy are popular tools for measuring properties of molecules as they enable research discoveries and chemical characterizations of value to industry, health care, and environmental monitoring. Professor Xu is improving the spatial resolution of stimulated Raman microscopy so that objects with dimensions approaching those of large molecules can be chemically characterized on a routine basis, and in a highly robust and reliable fashion. Specifically, this project examines aerosols in the atmosphere that may contain harmful substances that can impair the health of individuals by causing respiratory illness, heart failure, or even prenatal defects. Understanding the composition, origin, and transformation of aerosols is of vital importance for reducing their production or lessening their affects. In addition to studying aerosols, Dr. Xu's team is also developing an educational module that connects cutting-edge scientific research laboratories with elementary and high school students in a standard classroom setting, via immersive virtual reality experiences. A range of chemical reactions are demonstrated to elementary and high school students through virtual reality streaming, thereby promoting their curiosity for science. Furthermore, Professor Xu's educational activities are improving the effectiveness of scientific outreach for promoting science to the general public.  <br/><br/>Being able to visualize the chemical properties of matter on small length scales is a major challenge for Raman microscopy. The project is addressing this need for super-resolution Raman microscopy by combining scanning probe microscopy and coherent stimulated Raman events. Chemical sensitivity is provided by the stimulated Raman process.  High spatial resolution is achieved by nanoscale probing using a scanning probe microscope tip. The project aims to achieve robust and reliable Raman imaging so as to differentiate objects separated by roughly 10 nanometers. Through integration of nanoscale infrared imaging techniques invented by the Xu group, multimodal spectroscopic and mechanical microscopy are possible for chemical, biological, and environmental samples. Professor Xu's team studies the chemical composition and physical properties of individual sub-micron-sized urban contaminant particles in the atmosphere, allowing his team to decipher their chemical origins and photochemical transformations, with identification of and control over aerosol pollutions being his team's ultimate goal. From efforts associated with the educational plan, many students in elementary and high school classrooms are connected to an advanced research instrument in a laboratory via real-time multimedia capture and streaming devices. The students experience the operation of advanced research instruments, solidifying learning outcomes. Educational activities will be shared with students in schools in the Bethlehem, PA School District.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Support from NSF requested here will enable the first workshop to address current knowledge gaps in the management of watershed systems, and specifically develop a cross-agency and institution community that can leverage existing research efforts, and develop new ones, to advance watershed science.  This support will contribute to enhance the participant representation at this workshop, as funds will be used to increase gender, racial, and early-career stage participant representation. Moreover, since a key outcome is developing lines of communication between federal agencies working in watershed science, this support will also ensure active NSF researchers from Critical Zone Observatories and others are in attendance to engage with these efforts. This workshop is a necessary first step to ensure the protection of water quality, research necessary for preserving drinking, agriculture, recreation, and sustaining wildlife uses. As cities, states, regions, and countries try to find new sources of uncontaminated water, preserving and enchaining clean water is a vital global mission in the 21st century. <br/><br/>A particular focus of the workshop is to reveal how physical, biological, and chemical processes integrate to govern hydrologic and biogeochemical function relevant to ecosystem services provided by watersheds. In particular this workshop will address applications of distributed science approaches to watershed science- with the goal to develop more coordinated, consistent, and open research networks. Key outcomes include (1) identifying the components of watersheds amendable to or as models for distributed science approaches, (2) analysis of the current watershed modeling efforts and discussion of what data is needed to implement these models across larger spatial scales (multi-watershed to continental), (3) development of field sampling and sensor development strategies, and (4) the social and research challenges and opportunities associated with the implementation of systematic distribute science plan.

For decades, systems software and applications used a generic block interface to access data in SSDs. Today it is feasible to access SSDs in both byte and block granularity through memory mapped input/output interfaces. However, it is still unclear how byte-addressable SSDs will be integrated in today's memory-storage hierarchy, how will they affect the design and implementation of systems software such as file systems, and how applications will benefit from the byte-accessible property of SSDs.<br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate the systems techniques to support and exploit the byte-accessibility of SSDs in modern memory-storage hierarchy. First, the project proposes to rethink the unified memory-storage hierarchy and efficiently use byte-addressable SSD as part of the main memory to ease the management and programmability of the dual byte and block-accessible interfaces. Second, the project proposes adaptive page migration mechanisms to enable applications to gain benefits from both byte-addressable, large-scale SSD and fast dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) concurrently and transparently. Third, the project proposes a new abstraction of fine-grained data persistence which will rethink the design and implementation of data persistency mechanisms and further reduce the associated performance overhead and redundant writes to storage devices. <br/><br/>As SSDs have been widely deployed in various computing platforms, the proposed research activities will benefit many fields of study with high-performance persistent storage requirements including scientific computing, big data analytics, and financial services.

PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States with treatment costs that exceeded $14.4 billion in 2010 and projected to double by 2040. Effective treatment of PD requires reliable early diagnosis of PD, however no objective test for definitive diagnosis of PD currently exists. Current diagnosis is based on outward symptoms like tremors, slow movement, rigid muscle, brain imaging and usually requires multiple visits with neurology specialists to avoid misdiagnosis. In fact, a 2013 study determined that the direct cost of diagnosis for a new PD patient on average amounts to $7,322 and with 60,000 new diagnosis of PD made every year in US, the market of PD diagnosis is estimated to be a minimum $0.4 billion. A new diagnostic approach for early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) will have a tremendous impact on the prevention and treatment of PD by providing a stratification strategy of patients and increase the success in clinical trial of PD treatment. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on an understanding of the role of protein homeostasis in the cell and developing tools and techniques to decipher these pathways. PD is a neurological disease with the key hallmark of large deposits of Lewy bodies, an amalgam of aggregated proteins, in the affected motor neurons. Literature reports have identified certain biomarkers in Lewy bodies that have unique signature of post-translational modification which can cross the blood brain barrier. This project leverages techniques that identify signatures on the biomarker in PD blood samples and utilize tools that recombinantly generate biomarkers and develop antibodies against them, which will allow development of a test kit for early detection of PD non-invasively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By leaving batteries behind, these devices can function maintenance-free, potentially for decades, enabling numerous applications in the Internet-of-Things. These battery-free devices can lose power at any point because of fluctuations in energy availability, which makes programming, debugging, and deployment challenging. The goal of this project is to develop the systems and tools that make these devices resilient to power failures, dependable, easier to program, and able to function in unpredictable environmental and energy conditions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this project are focused on improving adaptivity, programmability, reliability, and applicability of intermittent computing devices. Three complementary research thrusts are pursued: 1) development of a rigorous classification of energy harvesting environments built on identifying unique energy modes, aiding in application design; 2) prototyping a novel recognition circuit for anticipating changes in the energy harvesting environment or energy mode based on remanence decay; 3) development of a task-based programming language with built-in adaptation semantics leveraging energy modes and the recognition circuitry with accompanying low overhead runtime system.<br/><br/>The work in this project develops adaptive systems and tooling for intermittent computers that will enable even novices to build reliable and long-lived sensor devices. By making application development easier, and improving availability (and reliability), these systems will positively impact applications in healthcare (wearable and body sensor networks), defense, ecology, horticulture, infrastructure, wildlife tracking, space exploration, and many other areas where long-term, low cost, massive scale sensing is essential. <br/><br/>All hardware, software, and collected environmental profiles and energy traces will be made freely available, along with documentation and tutorials. These project artifacts will be stored in a dedicated repository for scientists, educators, hobbyists, and industry to access and use.

They are responsible for numerous volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as the recent Anchorage earthquake. Important dynamical processes take place in between the two converging plates, such as the buoyant rising of molten mantle rock below volcanoes. Seismology offers a direct way to image the convective zones of subduction, which are between 30 km and 200 km deep. Seismometers installed in the field record seismic waves from earthquakes occurring in the down going plate and all over the world. By modeling the wave forms and timing, using techniques like those used in medical ultrasound imaging, images of the subduction zone can be obtained. Here, the project team will install more than 300 seismometers above the Alaska subduction zone. It will take advantage of the seismic waves produced by the ongoing aftershocks from the Anchorage earthquake to image at high resolution the subsurface structures. This project will also test the imaging capabilities of the timely deployment of dense networks of small seismometers, a new approach in seismology. It will provide critical constraints for models of subduction zone dynamics and associated hazards, as well as field experience to seven students in seismology. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will support the deployment of 306 seismometers (three-component nodal sensors) to image the Alaska subduction zone at an unprecedented resolution.  It will take advantage of the active local seismicity enhanced by the aftershocks of the 2018 magnitude-7 Anchorage earthquake. Recent results from Cascadia indicate that ambient noise and teleseism body waves can be used to image crustal structure. Here, local seismicity will be used to image the mantle wedge and crustal structure. Distant earthquakes will be used to image subsurface discontinuities, such as the crustal thickness and the subducting slab. Surface waves from ambient noise will be used to characterize the shallow crustal structure. This should allow resolving at km-scale the structural complexity within the mantle wedge between the subducting Pacific plate and the overlying North American crust. Furthermore, by leveraging an ongoing smaller-scale project focused on the Denali fault, this work will allow the simultaneous characterization of small-scale fault zone structures and broader crustal contrasts across the fault. Higher resolution images will provide important constraints for models seeking to understand the dynamics of subduction zones. The project is led by three early-career scientists and will involve seven students in seismology for the field deployment and recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such meetings could include review panels, academic study groups, classrooms, or board meetings. The ability to understand, manage and react to the social processes occurring within such a group is a core aspect of social intelligence, which is important for collaboration in many contexts. This project is aimed at developing an integrated computational framework useful for analyzing the behaviors of individuals in a group; evaluating the interactions occurring within the group; and measuring any collective behaviors that might emerge from the group. This will be accomplished by exploring novel machine learning techniques to understand human behavior in face-to-face meetings. Outcomes of the study will advance understanding of collaboration and interactions in areas such as personalized health and STEM teaching and learning. The investigator will involve students and faculty who will be trained in the use of computational methods for teaching and learning, as well as cross-cultural interactions.<br/><br/>The investigator will apply social dynamics and computational methods to expand understanding of social interactions in face-to-face engagement using a level of analysis that reveals subtle signaling, personality, affect, and individual and collective influence. Testbeds will be developed from video data of students learning in a summer research program and new data sets will be developed based on faculty learning groups and students participating in a learning group at a University abroad. The first step will involve codifying individual behaviors and creating a model to generate data clusters representing prototypical behaviors in group meetings. Facial action units will serve as inputs into the model. The next step will explore interactivity of codified clusters representing individuals. Coupled recurrent networks will be used to understand interaction and influence by linking chains of sequenced data and applying recurrent neural networks. This variant of recurrent neural networks will be validated using artificially generated data sets. A third step will explore macro-emotions in groups by mapping individual behavior and personality types to influences on collective group emotion. Observations and features from an existing data set comprising galvanic skin response, facial expression, action units and gestures will be used. Methods to fuse these multimodal inputs will be explored and will consist of early fusion techniques (clustering) and later fusion techniques (regressors and classifiers). The testbeds for this research are diverse, including individuals with sensory disabilities and underrepresented minority groups. Methods emerging from the research could be used to assess learning and collaboration in classroom settings, meetings requiring strategic decision making, and study groups. Students participating in the research will gain important computational skills and knowledge requiring an integration of psychology and sociology.

The host of 2019 symposium is the University of Iowa. It is the first time that the meeting is taking place in the West of the Mississippi River. The meeting brings female graduate students and professional mathematicians of all ranks from postdoctoral researchers to professors together to discuss current mathematical research problems and learn how to search for academic and STEM-related jobs. (The symposium is open to everyone regardless of gender.) In this modern age, the development of mathematics is significantly fast and areas of research are widely spread. Reality is that people in different fields hardly communicate and collaborate. The Symposium is essential in bridging these gaps by building a sense of community among women in mathematics starting with the Midwest and promoting new research collaborations and mentoring relations.<br/><br/>In this symposium, presenters and speakers are chosen from four mathematical fields; (i) Algebra, (ii) Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, (iii) Mathematical Biology, and (iv) Geometry and Topology, that vary from pure math to applied math. One of the goals of the Symposium is to encounter current hot subjects in these and related fields. The Symposium features two one-hour plenary talks, twelve thirty-minute invited lectures and eight graduate student presentations in four parallel sessions and also a discussion on career issues. Especially the plenary talks are delivered in colloquium style to make the information more accessible to general audiences. In the parallel sessions, more detailed presentations of research will be given. Presentations by graduate students (which is a new feature of 2019 symposium, replacing presenting posters only in previous meetings) is expected to help them better in finding future collaborators and academic/non-academic positions.

Currently biopsy diagnosis is a labor-intensive process that relies upon 19th century microscope technology; pathologists are doctors who use microscopes to make diagnoses. Pathologists examine slides from breast biopsies as part of breast cancer screening programs for more than a million women each year in the US.  This is a highly subjective process and there is evidence that even pathologists may disagree with one another, especially with difficult cases. This is potentially large patient safety issue, as some patients may not be optimally triaged.  It is currently possible to digitize the slides as whole slide images (WSIs), but there are very limited options for computer assisted pathologist review and this is a major reason that the digital pathology market has not developed as rapidly as most experts predicted. This project is a major advance as it addresses a large clinical need ? augmenting pathologists in their ability to make efficient and accurate diagnoses; and it also has great commercial potential as a disruptive, must-have application in the early digital pathology marketplace.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue of accuracy and efficiency of pathologist diagnosis in breast core biopsies, and this should validate our approach as an unmet need in the current digital pathology marketplace. There are other groups applying machine learning to pathology, but this project is a unique approach that addresses practical issues related to expert training of the machine, rapidly displaying targeted images to pathologists, and providing a guiding support while keeping the doctors in control. The project will ask pathologists to label WSIs with their diagnoses; this data will be used to train an AI system; and the AI system performance will be studied. Preliminary studies seem to support that a human and AI system working together will be both more efficient and more accurate than a human working alone. If this expanded project validates this, then there is a tremendous commercial opportunity that can also have a positive impact on patients. Not only access to better diagnoses for patients, but also the possibility for any pathologist to perform at a higher level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful reproduction requires the interaction of parental chromosomes.  The same kind of chromosomal interactions are used by plant breeders to create new combinations of favorable traits.  The Copenhaver lab at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill together with their collaborators, the Henderson lab from the University of Cambridge previously developed a powerful technique for detecting and quantifying these chromosome interactions in a model plant species related to the mustard plant.  In this project the Copenhaver and Henderson labs will extend that technology into a commercial crop species tomato.  They will then use that technology to measure the effects of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors on influencing the number and genomic distribution of these chromosome interactions in order to understand the fundamental biological mechanism that drive plant reproduction, as well as to identify fruitful avenues for accelerating crop breeding.  The Copenhaver and Henderson labs will publish their findings in open-access formats, and make the genetic resources they develop available to researchers and industrial colleagues.  <br/><br/>Previously, the Copenhaver and Henderson labs developed a visual assay for measuring meiotic recombination frequencies directly in the gametes of Arabidopsis thaliana.  They assay, called the FTL system, employs a collection of lines harboring transgenes encoding pollen-specific fluorescent proteins expressed in the quartet (qrt) mutant background, which enable tetrad analysis in a higher plant.  In this project they will translate the FTL system into Solanum lycopersicum (tomato).  Using the tomato FTL system they will test whether CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in recq4 helicase homologs result in genome wide hyper-recombination.  They will also test whether CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in genes that mediate epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and small RNA biogenesis can alter recombination frequencies around specific chromosomal domains with distinct chromatin environments such as centromeres.  Prior work in Arabidopsis, suggests that exposure to high and low temperatures can significantly modulate recombination frequencies.  The Copenhaver and Henderson lab will test whether similar environmental manipulation can alter recombination frequencies in S. lycopersicum.  The project will provide training for two postdoctoral fellows as well as independent research experiences for undergraduates in both the Copenhaver and Henderson lab.

These flow batteries are useful for low-cost and more environmentally-friendly energy storage.  The project focuses on the in-depth understanding of the structure and battery performance relationships of battery components. The new knowledge provides guidance in developing low-cost redox active molecules for the use of redox flow batteries as a environmentally-friendly and scalable energy storage platform, thus, alleviating the global reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing the sustainable development of our society. The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, materials, and electrochemistry, and is therefore well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Liu develops educational programs serving Utah Stat University and wider communities throughout the State of Utah. Students at all education levels participate in building the necessary talent pool of the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the critically important and emerging field of renewable energy storage. Specifically, Professor Liu works with the USU Eastern Blanding Native American Summer Mentorship Program (NASMP) and the USU Stars Program. These programs focus on attracting and training native American students who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines and on stimulating interest and curiosity in science of academically-talented local high school students. <br/><br/>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) employing redox active organic molecules have been demonstrated to be highly attractive for energy storage. Previous studies of AORFBs have primarily emphasized full flow battery performance using redox active molecules.

In 2006, the US Department of Defense developed for the first time official criteria for the use of FDA-approved psychiatric medications ""in theater"", in the physical and tactical spaces of military operations including active combat. Conservative estimates suggest that 1 in 6 service members is now taking at least one psychiatric medication. The use of psychiatric medications by the US military has attracted public attention, and is poised to influence the ways that Americans think about soldiering and the nature of war. Studies on the topic remain largely theoretical and center on the ethics of military psychiatric medication use. This project aims to understand how these medications are prescribed and used in practice, as well as how military service members understand medication effects on the work of counterinsurgency. The results from this study will have important implications for public knowledge and policy, as well as for veteran advocates and clinical practice aimed at the post-service transition of veterans. The project fosters the inclusion of underrepresented student veterans in military and veteran-related academic research and to support diversity in social and behavioral science. It will do so by 1) mentoring student veterans, 2) bringing together researchers and veterans in a symposium to address ways forward for collaborative research, and 3) publishing a co-edited volume on this important topic. <br/><br/>Dr. Jocelyn Chua of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will explore how psychiatric medications have been assimilated into the operations, infrastructures and norms of post-9/11 counterinsurgency, how these medications are understood and experienced by soldiers, and what impact these medications have had on the cultural landscape of soldiering in the U.S. Given the Army's prescription trends and prominent role in ground combat operations compared with other military branches, the research will focus on the US Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. The PI and research team will use in-depth interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic observation to understand the formal and informal ways that psychiatric medications are being prescribed, accessed, used, and shared. The research team will also assess enlisted soldiers' experiences of psychiatric medication use in deployment and their evaluations of the propriety of these medications to counterinsurgency soldiering. The PI will also conduct archival research to contextualize current military psychiatric medication use within the recent history of the practice of US military behavioral and mental health. Research will be based in North Carolina and Washington, DC. Home to four military bases, including Fort Bragg Army base, North Carolina currently has the third highest number of active duty and reserve members of all US states. The National Archives and the National Library of Medicine in Washington, DC and Maryland, respectively, house extensive military resources for the archival research. Findings from this research will illuminate how psychiatric medications are used in deployment and soldiers' own accounts of their use in order to determine the extent to which theoretical concerns and public debate align with the experiences and concerns of soldiers themselves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will examine household network dynamics influencing disparities in risks among vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults and low income families) due to infrastructure service disruptions. The education objective is to integrate empathy and human-centric considerations with technical concepts in training next-generation practitioners and researchers of resilient infrastructure. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the anticipated outcomes will yield transformative ideas to enhance how infrastructure systems can best be produced and managed to promote socially just and resilient services for different subpopulations. <br/><br/>This project involves an integrative research, education, and outreach plan. The research component of this project will: (1) empirically characterize the influence of household-level socio-demographic characteristics, expectations, norms, and other factors on service gaps and adjustment practices when infrastructure disruptions occur; (2) model and analyze household social networks at the neighborhood scale to determine the effects of social network structure and stability on the diffusion of information and adjustment practices through social media; and (3) analyze the interplay between infrastructure networks and household social networks to examine the spatial patterns of risk disparity among different sub-populations at the urban scale. The research approach involves methodological fusion among household surveys, fine-grained social media data analytics, and computational agent-based modeling to extract, characterize, simulate, and examine household networks. The research approach will be tested in the context of Hurricane Harvey in Houston with a focus on electricity, water, and road disruptions. The education component of this project will create and test an empathic learning model consisting of multiple human-centric course modules, interdisciplinary service-learning projects, and seminars to promote empathy and critical thinking skills in participating students. The outreach activities and service learning projects will focus on underserved neighborhoods in Houston and will involve deep community engagement with stakeholders and residents to broadly disseminate findings. These integrative research, education, and outreach elements will promote convergence research for integrating social equality with infrastructure resilience and better incorporate the needs of vulnerable populations in planning and prioritization of infrastructure services.

Currently, commercialized wearable sensors and Internet of Things devices are only capable of tracking physical activities and vital signs, and fail to non-invasively access molecular-level biomarker information to provide insight into the body's dynamic chemistry. Also, at the current state, blood-based sensing techniques that provide direct measurements of circulating biomarkers cannot be scaled across the general population for point-of-person daily monitoring (due to their invasive nature and risk of infection). Alternatively, other biofluids can be probed, which share biomarker partitioning pathways with blood and can be accessed non-invasively. In this regard, sweat is an excellent candidate, because it is a rich source of biomarkers that originally diffused from blood and can be retrieved in a wearable format and without user intervention. By attaining reasonable level of predictive accuracy in providing non-invasive proxy measures of blood biomarkers, wearable sweat sensors allow for monitoring the well-being of individuals and enable actionable feedback to improve their health and performance.   <br/><br/>The proposed research addresses fundamental bottlenecks critical to advancing the field of sweat-based biosensing at device, sensor, and data analytics levels. In the proposed approach, by devising programmable iontophoretic sweat induction and microfluidic interfaces, the interfering effects of confounders and contamination will be mitigated. A high throughput electro-modification sensor development methodology will be devised for the multiplexed construction of chemically diverse sensing features in microarray formats, which will be tailored to accurately measure sweat biomarkers on body. Furthermore, an analytical framework will be developed to provide undistorted measures of the sweat biomarkers, thus rendering individual-level temporal estimates of blood biomarker levels to establish the correlation and clinical utility of sweat readings. Upon achieving the proposed milestones, a new class of biomarker analysis platforms, with real-time information sensing and transmission capabilities, emerge that can facilitate general population well-being and performance monitoring. Equally important, the versatility of the devised methodologies allows for their use, with minimal reconfiguration, to target biomarkers in other biofluids (interstitial fluid, saliva, urine, and blood). The large data sets that will be collected through these technologies will expand our understanding of personal and societal health needs. Future generations of scientist will be trained by synergistically integrating the outreach and education plans with research activities. A diverse community of high school/undergraduate students will participate in research. The research findings will be integrated in the biosensing courses that the PI is developing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The electron also has another intrinsic property, called spin, which is intuitively analogous to a spinning ball of charge. In the area of spin-electronics, or spintronics, the spin property of electron is exploited to make new devices. For example, the read-head sensor in magnetic hard-disk drives is a spintronic device.  The next technology step for spintronics is to realize a spin-switch where the added benefit of non-volatility will be novel compared to charge-based technologies. But several performance-related parameters require significant improvement in order to achieve a nanoscale spin-switch with long lifetime and high energy-efficiency. One approach is to modify the material components inside spintronic devices to address the challenges. Such is the objective of the research plan. Several pre-identified novel magnetic materials and their combinations will be implemented in an advanced spintronic device using thin-film growth and nanoscale device fabrication techniques. The nanoscale spin devices will be characterized for their switching, scaling, energy-efficiency, and speed characteristics to test the feasibility of the materials. Successful implementation of the research plan has the potential for a high payoff and lead to energy-efficient spin-devices. A broad-based training and education of several graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be accomplished in materials, device physics and device design, fabrication and characterization. The program will actively focus on promoting interest in science, technology and engineering disciplines among undergraduates and local high school students through several synergistic outreach efforts within the local southern Illinois area.<br/><br/>Spintronics is recognized as a promising technology to address the scaling problems of current semiconductor devices.  In emergent Spin-Transfer Torque Random-Access Memory, parameters such as thermal stability and switching current density, in addition to ON/OFF ratio, are important for such technologies to be viable below the 20 nm node. In this proposal, several new material combinations will be investigated in spin device configurations to directly address the challenging issues of spintronics technology.  Several inverse-Heuslers magnetic materials that show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and high spin-polarization will be investigated. Magnetic Tunnel Junction and Spin-transfer Torque devices will be designed, fabricated and tested for their ON/OFF ratio, switching current/efficiency, and thermal stability. In the initial phase, the tunnel magnetoresistance properties will be tested on micron-scale devices to establish the viability of the various materials combinations. In the second phase of the project, devices will be tested down to sub-20 nm level to investigate the scaling behavior of all relevant parameters. Nanoscale manipulation of spins in a device geometry will be conducted using shape anisotropy. Synergistic interface characterization of fundamental magnetic properties will be accomplished using synchrotron radiation at various national lab facilities. Successful implementation of project goals can lead to greater integration of spintronics technologies into current semiconductor devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research objective of this project is to investigate ways to significantly enhance thermal conductivity of polymer-semiconductor composite materials, through superior bonding between polymer and graphene with higher interfacial thermal transport and by controlling orientation of polymer chains and graphene nanoplatelets. The educational objectives of the project are to engage high school students through a summer camp program. To stimulate fascination with thermal transport, high school students will measure thermal response in different nanocomposites through colorful visualization of temperatures maps using infra-red imaging. Simultaneously the program will aim to enhance diversity by engaging Native American students from various tribal colleges in Oklahoma. The participants will develop understanding of both atomistic simulations and also perform experimental characterization of thermal transport.<br/> <br/>Within polymers, thermal conductivity is highest along the polymer chain axis. Simultaneous alignment of polymer chains and planar direction of nanoplatelets, to conduct heat along the most efficient directions in the two components, is achieved in this project through strain. Alignment is characterized through microscopy and imaging. Non-equilibrium Green?s function technique has been used to reveal covalent bonding schemes enabling superior phonon transmission between polymer and graphene. Functionalized polymer composites prepared through such schemes are thermally characterized in this work through both experiments and atomistic simulations. Energy gap in the vibrational spectra of semiconductors has been shown to suppress scattering of low energy phonons, leading to large enhancement in their lifetimes, and overall material thermal conductivity. Strain can further increase energy gap, resulting in higher phonon lifetimes. Strain effects are quantified in this project by deriving interatomic force interactions from density-functional theory and using them with an exact solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation to predict thermal conductivity. Design of next generation high thermal conductivity polymers and semiconductors will lead to high impact opportunities for improving thermal management in a wide array of technologies.

Many of these injuries result from damage to the axons, the long extensions of neurons that allow communication between brain cells.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will contribute to the understanding of brain trauma by developing advanced computer models that link neuroimaging results, biomechanical assessments, and computational modeling of the brain.  Specifically, this project will develop and validate a model of axonal damage using controlled experimental methods.  More broadly, the continued pursuit of the development and validation of numerical diagnostics is anticipated to advance the emerging field of computational medicine.  This project will integrate education and outreach activities with the research, including a mobile ""NSF Sideline Science"" curriculum that teaches and promotes awareness of brain science and computational medicine for K-12 students and the general public.  In addition, a systematic multiyear study will examine the effectiveness of a new junior-level computational tools course on improving undergraduate performance in other core engineering and design courses.  Also, a graduate-level, semiannual colloquium will enhance students' understanding of the power of advanced cyberinfrastructures to solve diverse problems in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Diffuse axonal injury is a common pathology associated with traumatic brain injury in which deformation of axonal cells leads to rupture and axonal degeneration; yet, there remain difficulties with interpreting the degree of injury based on imaging of structural changes.  Axonal fiber tracts formed from organized collections of neural cells can be visualized using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging.  These images will be used in conjunction with a new multiscale embedded finite element technique that models the complex nature of axonal tracts in the brain.  The research objective is to develop a validated multiscale computational method that explicitly includes axonal fiber tracts from diffusion-weighted neuroimaging and predicts primary and secondary effects of axonal injury over time.  The central hypothesis is that changes in diffusion tensor imaging can be fully explained through the use of computational predictions of axonal fiber bundle strain.  This project will develop a new computational tool, or ""Digital Brain,"" that leverages advanced cyberinfrastructures and expands capabilities in the emerging field of computational medicine.  This will be accomplished through the implementation of a new multiscale embedded finite element technique to model the complex nature of axonal tracts in the brain as well as a time-dependent, inelastic damage model for the axonal fiber tracts and surrounding extra cellular matrix.  Both will be validated using controlled experimental methods.  The model will extend from the molecular to the organ level to study axonal injury mechanisms.  Single cell-to-fiber tract coupling will enable the transfer of structural and functional information across scales.  This multiscale modeling will thus provide insight into primary and secondary Wallerian injury cascades associated with brain injury.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Risks of groundwater contamination frequently arise from natural, agricultural, or industrial activities. To preserve the safety of these drinking water sources, it is crucial to understand how contaminants are expected to move and spread underground. An important factor that influences the movement of contaminants is the variability of the void spaces in soil and rocks known as pores. Complex flow patterns arise as groundwater moves through intricate pores of different shapes and sizes, which make predictions of flow complicated. Many mathematical predictions of groundwater flow ignore the complex variability in pores. This oversimplification results in a large discrepancy between flow predictions and observations. The central scientific goal of this project is to better understand how contaminant movement is controlled by measurable features of the pores. The first step of this project will statistically identify the most relevant attributes of pores that effectively describe flow in rock. The second step will apply this relationship to develop a new mathematical model of flow and contaminant movement. Collectively, this work will deliver more accurate tools to predict contaminant movement and to help protect water resources.  The project will train students and water managers through the development of an interactive web-based tool designed to allow users to understand and manipulate groundwater flow in a virtual environment.<br/><br/>Solving the flow and mass transport through heterogeneous porous media is central to many technological applications spanning groundwater remediation, oil recovery, and geotechnical engineering. The approaches to do so are currently limited, because the required calculations become computationally expensive as accuracy and domain size increase. The central scientific goal of this project is to establish a formal quantitative relationship that explains how local fluid velocities and overall flow arrangement are controlled by spatially correlated variations of geometric pore characteristics. This association would enable predicting non-Gaussian velocity distributions from relevant statistical descriptors of the pore space alone, which in turn can be used to predict effective transport. Finding this elusive link will lead to significant improvements in predictive capabilities for groundwater flow and contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous systems of arbitrary domain size. To achieve this goal, the proposed work will first statistically identify how velocity variations are induced by the physical attributes of the underlying pore space in digitally-scanned rock samples of diverse heterogeneities. These virtual data contain detailed information of the structure, the flow and the transport. Next, the newly-determined pore structure-flow relation will be integrated into the leading modeling framework for anomalous transport behavior and assessed for performance. The main educational goal is to enhance student understanding about how groundwater flows and how contaminants spread in it. This will be done through the development of interactive web tools for non-experts (targeting high-school, college and continued education students) that can be used in flipped-classroom environments. The interactive tool design allows the user to manipulate groundwater models, explore the results as automatically-generated graphics, and discover answers to their own questions in a self-directed application of the scientific method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are responsible for numerous volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as the recent Anchorage earthquake. Important dynamical processes take place in between the two converging plates, such as the buoyant rising of molten mantle rock below volcanoes. Seismology offers a direct way to image the convective zones of subduction, which are between 30 km and 200 km deep. Seismometers installed in the field record seismic waves from earthquakes occurring in the down going plate and all over the world. By modeling the wave forms and timing, using techniques like those used in medical ultrasound imaging, images of the subduction zone can be obtained. Here, the project team will install more than 300 seismometers above the Alaska subduction zone. It will take advantage of the seismic waves produced by the ongoing aftershocks from the Anchorage earthquake to image at high resolution the subsurface structures. This project will also test the imaging capabilities of the timely deployment of dense networks of small seismometers, a new approach in seismology. It will provide critical constraints for models of subduction zone dynamics and associated hazards, as well as field experience to seven students in seismology. <br/><br/>This RAPID project will support the deployment of 306 seismometers (three-component nodal sensors) to image the Alaska subduction zone at an unprecedented resolution.  It will take advantage of the active local seismicity enhanced by the aftershocks of the 2018 magnitude-7 Anchorage earthquake. Recent results from Cascadia indicate that ambient noise and teleseism body waves can be used to image crustal structure. Here, local seismicity will be used to image the mantle wedge and crustal structure. Distant earthquakes will be used to image subsurface discontinuities, such as the crustal thickness and the subducting slab. Surface waves from ambient noise will be used to characterize the shallow crustal structure. This should allow resolving at km-scale the structural complexity within the mantle wedge between the subducting Pacific plate and the overlying North American crust. Furthermore, by leveraging an ongoing smaller-scale project focused on the Denali fault, this work will allow the simultaneous characterization of small-scale fault zone structures and broader crustal contrasts across the fault. Higher resolution images will provide important constraints for models seeking to understand the dynamics of subduction zones.

As the proposed torque sensing method is based on the speed, it can be used with most of the engine/transmission systems.  However, this technique requires modifications to make it suitable for use with electric engines.  This will enhance its applicability over a larger range of vehicle applications.  Automotive manufacturers also need the comparison of input torque at the engine and the torque delivered after the differential to the wheels.  This knowledge further helps in reducing possible losses in torque, and improving the efficiencies. This torque sensing method can meet automobile industry requirements of improved efficiency, low cost, while also providing accurate engine torque measurements. The total available market could include all automotive engines and transmissions in the medium and heavy duty vehicles, off-high way vehicles and others in the transportation sector. The long-term goal of this project is to expand the use of this method in other sectors, where instantaneous torque measurement can help to improve the process efficiency.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps Project will help to investigate the commercialization potential of low cost torque sensors in different engine/transmission driven applications.  Relying on a virtual torque sensing concept, the proposed method requires minimal additional hardware, which makes it an economically attractive concept for automotive manufacturers.  Currently, automotive engine and transmission manufacturers use estimates for torque values.   The company found that the current engine ECU torque estimation has an accuracy of 5-30%.  Commercially available torque sensors cost $500 to $10000, making them non-viable for commercial transportation vehicles. Overall, the goal of the project is to seamlessly integrate the sensor along with the existing mechanical and electronic systems.

Currently, there are around 700,000 individuals diagnosed with brain tumor in the US, with another 80,000 expected to be diagnosed this year (National Brain Tumor Society, 2017). Nearly two thirds, or 54,000, of these patients will undergo surgery as a first course of treatment at one of 5,000 neurosurgical centers in the US. The majority of patients are currently treated with invasive cranial flap resection procedures. Furthermore, the proposed technology may offer a therapeutic option for the 13,000 patients with high-risk primary malignant tumors that may be considered inoperable with current surgical approaches. The thermal ablation medical device market represents a $2.2B opportunity in the US, with ultrasound thermal ablation technology valued at $334M with an annual market growth rate of 13.5% (BCC Research, 2017). This innovation would offer a unique tool for neurosurgeons apart from cranial surgical navigation tools with a $459M US market, which are currently considered the standard of care for cranial surgery.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore a minimally invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device to ablate brain tumors and other cranial soft tissues, which features a hybrid transducer tip to apply therapeutic ultrasound to the targeted anatomy while simultaneously using ultrasound imaging to visualize the surgery site. Our simulation modeling determined the appropriate parameters for an initial prototype to precisely focus ultrasound and create a lesion using a flexible transducer phased array in a heterogeneous medium volume simulating cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue (Zhang et al., 2017, AAPM Annual Meeting). These data showed that our system could provide the same efficacy of treatment with two orders of magnitude less power than non-invasive, transcranial HIFU devices. The project team then built a prototype based on the simulation results, and showed proof-of-concept functionality using a bovine serum albumin protein phantom. One of the primary challenges of this project will be to maintain the acoustic performance of the probe as the project moves toward miniaturization of the technology to fit the probe within the brain ventricles. The team will pursue further customer discovery to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical workflow, revenue streams, reimbursement, and regulatory aspects, with the goal to build an evidence-based business plan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, nearly half of the world's 7,000 languages are under threat of disappearance, presenting linguistics with the urgent challenge of documenting under-studied languages while communities still use them. This dissertation project addresses these issues not only by documenting an under-studied, segmentally-rich language, but through groundbreaking adaptation of experimental methods to a fieldwork setting to provide rich, quantitative data of the type normally only available for well-studied languages. The researchers will conduct the first quantitatively-driven investigations of the sound system and grammar of Tsova-Tush, a critically endangered Northeast Caucasian language spoken in Georgia. This language family and region are both dramatically underrepresented in linguistics, meaning that quantitative data from this language are particularly valuable for helping to increase the diversity of the database available to linguistic science. Further, its location in Georgia is an ideal fieldwork setting for adapting experimental methods for an endangered language: Tsova-Tush is spoken in a rural, agricultural village with many of the challenges of other fieldwork sites, but with reliable enough access to transit and telecommunications to make the application and troubleshooting of experimental methods feasible. Finally, the documentation will provide valuable data about a segmentally complex language that will further our understanding of the cognitive demands of human language complexity in general. Broader impacts include a public repository of recordings and transcriptions, the training of a doctoral student, and facilitating access to linguistic resources for a minority language group to enhance scientific understanding.<br/><br/>The quantitative studies in the dissertation focus on three linguistic questions: the status of long vowels and consonants, the grammaticality of demonstratives and pronouns (indexicals), and the readability of a proposed writing system. It has been suggested that Tsova-Tush has both plain and ""intensive"" consonants, as well as short, long, and ""hyperlong"" vowels, but linguists lack the phonetic details to establish the exact properties of this complicated sound system. Through a detailed acoustic study with multiple speakers, this project will describe the durational properties that distinguish these consonants and vowels. Further, Tsova-Tush has a complex system of indexicals, distinguishing three deictic distances ('here'/'there'/'over there'), whose grammatical uses are poorly understood. In this project, an experiment will be conducted, in which speakers will be asked to judge the grammaticality of sentences with indexicals in a wide variety of contexts, thus establishing the parameters of indexical shift. Finally, based on the findings of these studies, the researchers will test the readability of a proposed Tsova-Tush writing system and provide speakers with linguistically sound recommendations for developing written materials in the language. The dissertation's description of the successes and challenges of the quantitative studies in a documentation scenario will help improve the methodologies of both documentary and experimental linguistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current security technologies in the IoT arena are either weak or expensive (usually both). The weakness in conventional approaches lies in their impractical goal of finding and fixing all security vulnerabilities. Modern systems have complexity that vastly outstrips the capabilities of any human or verification tool to find all the security vulnerabilities. The only way to somewhat mitigate this weakness is to throw significant resources at the problem, which is very expensive and still yields an imperfect result. The proposed technology developed in this SBIR Phase I project will provide practical and strong security. It gains these important properties by assuming that all systems are riddled with vulnerabilities, so it builds in security by making IoT computing devices that are unsolvable puzzles to attackers. In addition, it doesn't rely on IoT developers to deploy hand-crafted defenses; instead, developers simply build their applications on the proposed platform, and they receive all of its security benefits.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new direction in IoT security. Unlike the world of IoT security today, where developers and tools are attempting to find and fix every last security vulnerability (and always failing), the technology being developed is a hardware-based secure IoT technology that is impractically difficult to penetrate. It achieves this by engaging ensembles of moving target defenses (EMTDs) on the runtime information that attackers need to build their attacks. To overcome EMTDs, attackers must extensively probe the system to acquire the run-time information obscured by moving target defenses. To stop these probes, the technology utilizes a technology called churn to re-key moving target defenses while the system is in operation. Once the churn mechanism is engaged, attackers will have to start their attack over again from scratch. With churn cycles of 50ms (or less), the proposed secure IoT platform becomes impractically difficult to breach, across a broad array of attack classes. The work proposed in this SBIR Phase I project will advance the technology from simulation to a real hardware implementation, which will allow the technology to be deployed into the IoT marketplace.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The potential benefit is to fill this niche market opportunity, especially when considering the high incidence of hand disability due to stroke and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries. This system can provide structured therapy sessions which requires minimal therapist supervision while improving patient engagement which enhances the broader participation. As a complimentary technology for current rehabilitation practice, it has a potential to lower health care and labor costs associated with neurological rehabilitation. The outpatient physical rehabilitation market is a $30 billion industry growing at a rate of 7% in the US, mainly due to the growing elderly population. The robot-assisted rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by 2020. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available, the customer base will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally to home-based care. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project results from the combination of a soft robotic system with fine motor control synced to VR games for both sensory and motor stimuli. The robotic exoskeleton provides individual joint control to practice complex grasping while the VR environment provides targeted rehabilitation games.

Previous research has documented discrete systems of terracing in parts of the lowlands, importantly demonstrating that these landscapes were sometimes intensively curated and cultivated. Combining soil science, paleoethnobotany, remote sensing, and archaeology with existing ""big environmental data"" (LiDAR surveys of Above Ground Carbon Storage), the research will investigate these agrarian systems across ecologies and settlement patterns, critically evaluating the resilience of these systems across the Maya lowlands. Are terraces constructed only in response to population pressure? Why are terraces built in particular regions? Why do they endure in certain ecological settings and not in others? Does terracing in the lowlands increase local landscape resilience? Do communities maintain terrace systems once they are built? Throughout the world, questions of landscape resilience, especially related to smallholder agriculture are vitally important to address, so that we can better design, plan, organize and maintain systems that are resilient to cultural and ecological change.

The potential outcome of this project is a comprehensive line of robotic ultrasound transducers that enable a variety of interventional point-of-care robotic applications by enhancing the skills of a multitude of clinicians.  As a result, many technically challenging critical procedures will no longer be restricted to solely highly trained experts. Applications include central vascular access (pediatric and adult), biopsy, regional anesthesiology, precision extraction (e.g. thoracentesis), and precision injections (e.g. orthopedic biologics), creating an addressable market exceeding $2 billion. Benefits of man-machine teaming using hand-held medical robots include faster, simpler procedures that can be performed by a much broader group of clinicians, reduced medical complications and patient discomfort, and improved hospital infrastructure utilization, ultimately benefitting both clinical outcomes and total costs of care. Significant insights and implications for other man-machine teaming applications may also result from this project, with potential for robotic applications well outside of the medical realm. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project centers on demonstrating the feasibility of first-of-kind hand-held robotic capabilities for autonomous needle placement. This project builds on two existing layers of innovation. First is the ability to use real-time ultrasound data to send a needle precisely to a point in the body. This differs significantly from other imaging modalities that require multiple images from different orientations integrated ""off line."" Next, this is an autonomous and powered system. Once a user selects a target, the needle path is calculated and the needle is advanced automatically. This project builds the third level of innovation through its research objectives - creating the real-time ability to i) recognize and track the target as an object, and ii) make automatic robotic corrections to maintain that target during user or patient movement or changes in target characteristics. The research involves novel image recognition and tracking technology and very precise novel sensing and control loop technology that interact in real time to maintain targeting accuracy in a dynamic environment. The anticipated technical result is to enable a non-expert clinician to reliably enter a clinically challenging ""small"" central blood vessel in a pediatric patient model with an introducer needle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently young girls suffering from premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) as a result of anticancer treatments have limited and inadequate options to undergo puberty and start their transition into adult life. The existing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) applied to induce puberty in girls with POI leads to long-term morbidities, such as decreased bone density, predisposition to obesity and diabetes. The company's technology allows the restoration of ovarian endocrine function in prepubescent girls and has the potential to become a central mainstream treatment for POI, which would result in significant improvement of the short and long-term health and eliminate long-term morbidities associated with premature ovarian failure. The commercial benefit of the proposed treatment would result from significant lower health costs associated with obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will further the company's understanding of the current state of the field and the value of the proposed technology, and help identify the next steps for preclinical and clinical studies. The company developed an immunoisolating capsule that supports the survival and function of ovarian allograft eliminating the need for immune suppression. The company's central hypothesis is that ovarian tissue secretes the gonadal hormones, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, activins and inhibins, in response to systemic hormone stimulation in a pulsatile and dynamic rate required for physiological progression through puberty, growth and associated metabolic changes. Experimental data from in vivo mouse and primate studies have demonstrated promising results of restoration of hormone function integrated in the endocrine system and neuroendocrine axis, with no evidence of immune rejection or local inflammatory adverse response. The next critical steps in the company's project is to perform customer discovery and identify partners for first-in-human trials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It ultimately arises from on-going processes within the planet deep interior. These large-scale processes are in turn controlled by the properties of the constituent minerals of the deep Earth.  A mineral's crystal and electronic structures are its most fundamental characteristics, from which all other physical and chemical properties follow. Due to the high pressures (millions of atmospheres) and temperatures (thousands of degrees) of the Earth's mantle, there is limited knowledge of the crystal and electronic structures of minerals residing near its base. This region is primarily composed of silicate minerals that adopt structures known as perovskite and post-perovskite. In this project, the investigator will conduct laboratory experiments on these structures to probe how incorporation of iron affects their properties. He will study magnesium germanates, a class of compounds that are close analogs for the silicate minerals of the deep Earth yet can be studied at pressures and temperatures that are more easily attainable in the laboratory. Through this work, he will provide fundamental knowledge of mineral properties that are needed to interpret geophysical observations and constrain the physical processes in Earth's interior. This project will have implications for the understanding of mantle thermal convection, which drives plate tectonics at the origin of numerous hazards for human societies, and provide insights on the effect of extreme conditions of pressure and temperature on materials properties. The project will also provide support for the training of a graduate student<br/><br/>Iron influences key physical properties of lower mantle minerals including density, elasticity, element partitioning, and electrical and thermal conductivity. These properties in turn affect the interpretation of seismic and other geophysical observations and constrain models of the deep Earth. Perovskites and post-perovskites are major structures of the lower mantle. Iron in these materials may adopt different valences and spin states and may occupy different structural sites. High-pressure synchrotron Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy are the primary tools for investigating the electronic state of iron in mantle minerals. In this study the investigator will use these techniques together with conventional Mossbauer spectroscopy to explore the properties of perovskites and post-perovskites over a range of pressures and iron and aluminum contents. He will use magnesium gemanate analogs which lower pressure of formation, compared to that of Earth's silicates, will allow investigating the effect of pressure on post-perovskite properties. The expected results will provide strong constraints on the site occupancies, valences and spin states of perovskite and post-perovskite, as well as a direct test of recent theoretical calculations. They will contribute to unveiling the role of iron in perovskite and post-perovskite which is crucial for the unambiguous interpretation of Mossbauer spectra. They will also enable a more comprehensive understanding of spin-pairing behavior in major lower mantle minerals, thus better constraining the properties of Earth's deep mantle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.

Currently, issues with patient compliance lead to unintended costs to the healthcare industry. Lower extremity conditions are especially prone to issues because of the lack of clarity on how to recover at home. This process is subject to confusion which can cause patients to either apply too much or too little weight during rehabilitation, leading to many complications. These can include malalignment of bone which requires additional treatment or even surgery. 15 million people experience lower extremity injuries each year and the rate of complications lead to approximately $12 billion in unintended costs. The SoleMate insole aims to resolve this issue by providing patients with real-time feedback to correct form by measuring weight applied while walking. This information is not only helpful for patients, but physicians are also informed on how compliant patients were during recovery. There are no other products that can track rehabilitation based on weightbearing. Furthermore, the applications for this technology extend past medicine. An insole that can accurately track how someone walks can be applied to sports and orthopedic research.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is aimed for manufacturing a device that can accurately measure weightbearing while walking during an episode of care. Sensors placed in the insole are coupled with a patient-specific algorithm that generates a summary that patients can check on their smart phone. This information will also be integrated into a patient?s summary on recovery at the doctor?s office. Real-time feedback on how much weight a patient applies throughout the day can correct for form. From a clinician?s perspective, this information can be useful on tailoring future treatment to the individual. There are other research devices that can accurately measure how someone walks, but these devices are typically expensive and wired to a computer. Creating a wireless device allows for continual feedback and a more accurate picture of someone?s activity throughout the day.

For immigrants to the United States and other countries, it is an often-repeated ""rule"" that language shift typically occurs by the third generation (i.e., the grandchildren of the original immigrants). This project, which trains a student in rigorous, empirically-grounded methods of data collection and analysis in cultural and linguistic anthropology, asks what factors might contribute to influence language shift among an earlier generational cohort. Additionally, the researcher explores whether there are grammatical, phonological or other patterns that can be identified in first-generation language shift, and how speakers navigate overlapping identities in the new cultural context. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in linguistics and anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to improve public understanding of indigeneity, language shift, and multilingualism. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and contributes to the education of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Under the supervision of Dr. Mary Bucholtz at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Anna Bax will work with a selected cohort of Mixtec women who grew up in Ventura County, California to understand how they variably use Spanish, English, and Mixtec for identity construction purposes. In Ventura County, the majority of the indigenous immigrant community is of Mixtec heritage and speak Mixtec languages, which are native to southern Mexico and differ radically from Spanish. This linguistic and anthropological project explores the question of how young women in this diasporic community, who may face gendered expectations to maintain their heritage language and culture, navigate the accelerated process of first-generation language shift. It seeks to address the following research questions: (1) How is Mixtec identity linguistically constructed, even as many community members are losing the ability to speak Mixtec entirely? How can Spanish and English linguistic resources come to symbolize Mixtec identity in the wake of this loss? (2) What strategies do individual participants use to navigate community language shift, and how do they balance their overlapping identities as indigenous Mexicans and as new members of American society? The researcher will take a case-study approach, using linguistic-anthropological and sociophonetic methods to explore how these young women maintain strong links to their indigenous identity, even as some of them have lost the ability to speak their heritage language. Participant-observation and ethnographic interviews will be conducted with this focal set of youth, as well as with key members of their social networks. In order to collect rich, detailed data about the participants' varying linguistic repertoires, they will also audio-record their own speech practices in naturalistic interaction in different social settings, so as to document shifts in their use of the focal linguistic variables and their performances of indigenous identity. The researcher will conduct a quantitative sociophonetic analysis of one Spanish and one English linguistic variable, with a focus on the connections of these variables to indigenous identity and how the use of the variables differs across social contexts. The participants' speech will also be compared to a corpus of local Chicanas' speech to understand the social construction of linguistic difference and/or similarity. Qualitative discourse-analytic methods will be used to understand the social meanings attached to these variables, as well as the meaning of participants' Mixtec code-switching practices. The results of this research will benefit local community centers who are invested in the maintenance of indigenous languages, and will be used to inform local public and educational policymaking about linguistic diversity. In addition, the project directly benefits the young indigenous participants, most of whom are current college students, by centrally involving them in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy use in buildings represents roughly 40% of total U.S. energy demand. It is projected that over half the buildings that will be in use in 2050 are already built. Retrofitting existing buildings with smart windows that regulate/monitor sunlight transmission could reduce building energy consumption by 10 - 40% and represents a $64B total addressable market, but is presently prohibitively complex and labor intensive. Transparent, NUV solar cells will simplify smart glass/film adoption by obviating the need for external wiring, thereby catalyzing deployment of smart window technologies in existing buildings to increase energy efficiency and enhance occupant health and productivity. Similarly, IoT smart devices/sensors promise to make the built environment more efficient by giving users more control over appliances, information, and energy use. Transparent NUV solar cells can provide point-of-use power to in-window IoT devices/sensors without altering aesthetics. For the photovoltaic community, the operation physics and performance of the NUV photovoltaic technology developed through this program will be of broader interest, as NUV wavelengths are inefficiently harvested by conventional photovoltaics.<br/><br/>The proposed project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows monolithically without competing for visible or near-infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate or imposing design constraints on window aesthetics. First-generation NUV solar cells exhibit power scalability with area, and single-junction photovoltages exceeding 1.6 V (record for thin-film PV). This Phase I project aims to (1) translate NUV solar technology from rigid glass to a flexible substrate, and (2) demonstrate use of low-cost transparent electrode alternatives. These breakthroughs will allow for facile integration of NUV solar cells with smart windows for self-powered operation and intelligent management of the solar spectrum, with NUV photons powering the regulation of visible and near-infrared photons for natural lighting and heating purposes, respectively. Additionally, the aesthetically-discreet nature of flexible, transparent NUV solar cells can enable remotely-powered internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices/sensors.

Leading sunscreens that are currently on the market have been shown to be inadequate in protection against UVA damage (photoaging). Moreover, Oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are found in over 80% of chemical sunscreens, have been shown to be highly toxic to coral cells. Estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen settle into the world?s coral reefs every year and the oxybenzone that is present in many of these sunscreens cause coral bleaching and accelerate the destruction of the world?s already fragile coral reefs. The Magic Blue sunscreen uses an alternative eco-friendly technology to protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage, and the successful commercialization/market adoption of the Magic Blue sunscreen will significantly benefit the global environment by protecting our aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs, from further oxybenzone/octinoxate-induced damage. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel coral reef-friendly sunscreen that can provide broad spectrum protection. Magic Blue, LLC is partnering with the University of Maryland, College Park and collaborating with the Carnegie Institution for Science to conduct the key feasibility experiments, including biological analysis of UVA protection in 2D and 3D human skin tissues, chemical assays on SPF determination, and environmental study on the effects of the new sunscreen on soft and hard coral reefs.  Once these experiments are complete, Phase II of the project will revolve around obtaining necessary FDA approval for commercial launch. The overall outcome from a successful STTR project will be the commercialization of the world?s first sunscreen that will encompass the following attributes: scientifically proven to protect against UVA-induced photoaging, abilities to provide sufficient UVB protection and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and safe to coral reefs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In environmental applications, reactive nanobubble technologies could impact water or wastewater treatment industries, municipal water treatment plants, drinking water disinfection, natural and landscape water management and remediation of impaired water bodies (e.g., by algal bloom). Value propositions include the improved water treatment efficiency (e.g., increased disinfection efficacy), reduced use of traditional hazardous chemicals such as chlorine, and reduced maintenance/operational cost in water remediation. In agricultural fields, irrigation with nanobubble water can significantly improve dissolved oxygen in water by 100-5000% and efficiently deliver oxygenated water and growth elements such as nitrogen to plant roots. Thus, the value propositions include improving crop or plant's growth, health and quality. Moreover, nanobubble water can positively affect turf and grass business and promote reduced or chemical-free fertilization in turf or lawn maintenance and therefore increase ecosystem safety and reduce negative environmental impacts.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores fundamental engineering principles of colloidal bubble systems at nanoscale dimensions. Innovative scientific approaches employ reactive nanobubbles to control and mitigate water pollution as well as support smart agricultural irrigation/fertilization. Specifically, nanobubble technologies are processes that generate ultra-small sizes of bubbles with a diameter of < 1 um dispersed in water or other liquid media. Nanobubbles in water have a long residence time in water due to their low buoyancy and excellent stability against coalesces, collapse or burst, and the formation of bulk bubbles. Therefore, compared to regular bulk or large bubbles, nanobubbles have a higher efficiency of mass transfer due to their high surface areas, which also facilitates physical adsorption and chemical reactions in the gas-liquid interface. Therefore, nanobubble technologies are potentially useful in many industrial and engineering applications, ranging from ultra-sound imaging and intracellular drug delivery, pharmaceutical manufacturing, detergent-free surface cleaning, mining separation, water purification to wastewater treatment. This I-Corps project focuses on the evaluation of unique business models in water pollution control and mitigation as well as irrigation for agricultural applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing coagulation analyzers put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. This project will develop Acoustic Tweezing Thomboelastometry (ATT) for these patients.  Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $2.0 billion annually.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood (<6uL in volume).  The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly minimal marketable product for the market of pediatric coagulation analyzers. This goal will be achieved by meeting the following three objectives: 1) build the user-friendly prototype; 2) develop integrated software for device control, data acquisition, and data analysis; and 3) calibrate the prototype and standardize it for coagulation measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, what proportion of arrested noncitizens are prosecuted? For what charges? What proportion are sentenced to jail or prison? Our lack of knowledge on these questions is consequential given that the majority of incarcerated non-U.S. citizens are in state prisons and immigration enforcement increasingly takes place in partnership with local criminal justice authorities. As a result, the decisions made by local police, prosecutors, and judges often determine both the criminal justice outcome and the immigration case outcome. Thus, understanding how local criminal justice actors use this discretion is fundamentally important for understanding current criminal justice practices and contemporary immigration enforcement.  <br/><br/>The lack of knowledge on the local criminal processing of immigrants is largely due to data constraints, in that information on foreign-born or legal status is rarely available in most state court databases. This project addresses this limitation by leveraging unique criminal history data from California and Texas - the two largest immigrant destinations in the U.S. - which tracks criminal cases from arrest through sentencing. Specifically, this project uses detailed case information on all arrests in California and Texas between 2006 and 2016 (~26 million) from the California Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) program and the Texas Computerized Criminal History System (CCH). Because both the CORI and CCH datasets include information on foreign-born status for arrestees, this project will be the first to provide even descriptive information on the case processing of immigrants in the contemporary United States. This inquiry is motivated by a central research question: Do otherwise similar citizen and noncitizen arrestees caught engaging in the same criminal conduct receive different case outcomes? Using the CORI and CCH data, this project investigates this question at multiple key stages in case processing, such as the decision to charge, the type of charging offense, and incarceration outcomes (e.g. prison, jail, or no imprisonment).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed innovation incorporates both a Lidar and a thermal detector to locate objects but also classify them, as this is the most crucial aspect of autonomous vehicles. The dual polarity Lidar+Thermal photodetector solves a few major issues in the current Lidar industry. First, current Lidars have to use advanced algorithms to classify the objects, whereas a Lidar+Thermal detector can easily distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, while continuing to establish their location. This is done due to the drastic heat signature of animate objects. Second, the dual polarity detector is able to detect and locate hazards on the road such as snow or puddles, which is vital if autonomous vehicles are used in northern regions. In addition, the frame rate of the Flash Lidar+Thermal is up to 200 Frames per second, which will drastically reduce smearing effects and allow for driving at speeds of 70+ MPH. Lastly, the high thermal resolution of the camera will ensure operation in bad weather conditions including fog and rain.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept of the dual polarity Lidar+Thermal detector. An array of 32x32 pixels will demonstrate that in one polarity, a thermal hot-mid-wave image and in the other polarity the pixels will operate in a time-of-flight mode for Flash Lidar operation. The pixel?s spectral response will range from 500nm up to 3.5?m in the Lidar mode. Characterization of the detector array will use the eye-safe 1550nm laser. The goal is to show a 200m Lidar operation with a high resolution of a few centimeters and thermal imaging with a thermal sensitivity of 4mK. The transition to Phase II will include an array size of 1000x500 with 10?m pixel pitch.

The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals.<br/><br/>The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need.

To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed software system will be integrated into laboratories' pipelines for clustering and assembling sequencing reads into complete genomic sequences. The proposed statistical algorithms will analyze the sequencing data more accurately which improves sequencing quality without an increase in sequencing depth thus further reducing sequencing cost.

Methane, the third largest energy source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power, weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural, waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor product line. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising sensor technology from a small business research and development project into the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. <br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to create a self-contained methane sensor system, smaller in size than a quarter, with the sensitivity of advanced laser spectrometers. Current methods of detection do not meet the needs of industry. They are either cheap, high power and low sensitivity, such as catalyst-based systems, or they are large, expensive, high power optical systems. There is a market need for methane sensors that improve upon size, weight and power, while still maintaining useful sensitivity and selectivity. The system consists of 3 primary modules: the replaceable or consumable sensor package, the sense electronics, and the data storage and communication system. Due to the extremely low power requirements of the sensor, clever design of the data and communications system is critical if the low power benefits of the sensor are to be realized in a product. Ultimately, the system will include wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Zigbee) for cloud and IoT data management. This design will be prototyped and will undergo performance measurements. Materials for methane sensing will be identified  The objective of SBIR Phase 1 is to produce an initial prototype sensor for methane-sensing that will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immersive media computing is an emerging computing paradigm that aims to create the sensation of 3D immersion in a real or virtual environment. The recent development of immersive media computing has enabled a host of compelling technologies such as 360-degree videos, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality, potentially transforming a wide spectrum of sectors in healthcare, training, education, entertainment, tourism, etc. The REU site will train undergraduate students in this emerging computing paradigm and benefit their graduate application and job hunting. Through various activities such as seminars, demos, presentations, field trips, and other professional development opportunities, undergraduate students will also enhance their professional skills. This REU site aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research activities, especially in the neighboring regions with numerous Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Women Colleges. <br/><br/>The emerging nature of immersive media computing leads to the strong intellectual merit of this project. Despite the rich history of research on regular images and videos, the computing of immersive content poses significant research challenges.

Inspired by two significant trends in programming language research, namely gradual types and theorem proving languages, this work synthesizes aspects of both to enable pathways to verified programming at every point along the spectrum from scripting languages to verification-integrated languages. The investigators develop a foundational theory of gradual verification, design and implement a general purpose language with integrated gradual verification, and devise pedagogical approaches to teaching verification to novice programmers. By making verification easier to use in a gradual way, developers will be more likely to make use of these techniques, bringing the known benefits of verification to more programmers. This project develops methods to teach gradual verification to beginner programmers and evaluates them in the new introductory programming sequence at University of Maryland.<br/><br/>This research supports software development practices that integrate verification at each step and removes impediments to fortified programming.  At the core of the technical approach is gradual verification, a technique that leverages run-time enforcement mechanisms and systematically turns these mechanisms in to static verification methods via abstract interpretation techniques. Moreover, due to the basis in run-time enforcement, verification becomes a spectrum rather than a binary, since properties that fail to statically validate can be enforced at run-time. This approach enables programs to evolve over time along a less- to more-verified gradient and opens up the possibility for a number of useful programming tools that are reinforcing, productive, and universal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each of the more than 500 VTCs around the country seeks to connect qualifying veterans with substance use and mental health services. This project examines why these courts have emerged and how they operate. Researchers examine the origins and practices of three distinct VTCs, one in Florida, California, and Massachusetts. Each address different community needs, with different rules related to participation, legal outcomes, and treatment plans. This project involves veteran students from different academic institutions in research focusing on how these courts seek to aid a uniquely vulnerable population.<br/><br/>By examining the purpose and practice of VTCs, the project addresses why and how local legal innovations emerge to address entrenched social and political problems such as drug use, mental health disorders, poverty and war. Further, the research addresses how these innovations integrate logics from disparate institutional fields related to medicine, criminal justice, and social welfare. Finally, the analysis will reveal how authorities encourage compliance in legal institutions with contradictory goals related to punishment and rehabilitation. The project involves team-based, comparative, ethnographic analysis, including long-term observation of court hearings, interviews with VTC founders and personnel working locally and nationally, and the collection of legislative histories and institutional documents that explain the purpose and practice of each VTC, as well as national level initiatives to promote VTCs.

However, researchers in the history or sociology of science cannot study what is accepted and what is rejected in these journals because until recently they did not have access to a body of data that included accepted and rejected manuscripts, the topics covered, the characteristics of those who submitted manuscripts, and the comments of the reviewers.  Moreover, they did not have such data over time, so that they might see changes within a discipline in terms of topics and submitters.  The American Sociological Association (ASA) has electronic copies of all the manuscripts and all the reviews for ASA journals for a twenty-year period between 1991 and 2010.  Based on a prior three-year, NSF-funded project, the Center for Social Science Research (CSSR) at the George Mason University has created a Digital Archive that contains this information for the American Sociological Review, the ASA top journal.   Given the complexities of the Archive data file, CSSR will hold a two-day workshop so that interested scholars can be trained to use it to answer critical questions about the history and development of sociology in a time-period of pronounced changes in the discipline.  Faculty trained on the use of the archive will pass on this knowledge to their colleagues in sociology and other disciplines to further the study of the peer-review system for a flagship journal.

However, children are susceptible to suggestion -- both from those who aim to influence their reports and those who aim to establish what children are alleging. Given children's susceptibility to courtroom questioning, the manner in which children are questioned about prior suggestive influence is incredibly important. How do children understand when attorneys are attacking the credibility of their reports, and how does the subtle phrasing of attacks influence children's responses? This investigation will assess how attorneys are questioning children in recent cases of alleged sexual abuse, as well as how children understand and respond to such questions. The findings can provide concrete recommendations for those questioning children about alleged crimes, helping to establish productive techniques that elicit accurate responses. In doing so, the proposed research has the potential to improve legal decision making in cases involving children, by providing questioning methods that better distinguish true from false allegations of abuse.<br/><br/>The researchers will utilize a mixed-methods approach. First they will conduct a systematic field assessment of how children are questioned in recent cases of alleged abuse. The findings will provide an indication of the frequency, content, context, and responsiveness to such assessments of credibility about suggestive influence. Second, a series of laboratory studies will assess children's comprehension and response patterns to such questions, with the materials developed in tandem with the findings from the field assessment to approximate courtroom questioning. In the laboratory studies, the researchers will also include questioning alternatives not used frequently by attorneys. Such findings will assess the boundaries on what children understand.

Scalable, universal quantum computing promises to be one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era. The range of applications are broad and will only expand with the development of new quantum algorithms, with one of the biggest opportunities being molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For example, despite being a multi-billion dollar industry, computational drug discovery is limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, qubit numbers must be increased several orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The proposed innovation of trapping and individual control of neutral atoms will, if successful, enable quantum computers to scale to the thousands of qubits needed for error-corrected, universal quantum computing.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology for scalable trapping and addressing of neutral atom qubits through dynamic, parallelized optical trapping and individual addressing of alkaline earth qubits. Neutral atoms are an emerging platform for quantum computing and the majority of work thus far has been directed towards alkali atoms (i.e., those with a single valence electron). Alkaline earth atoms have two valence electrons and correspondingly a richer energy level structure, which has demonstrated very long trapped coherence times.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.<br/><br/>Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and be made more efficient by using wide bandgap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include but are not limited to power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel contactless, hybrid current sensor offering an order of magnitude better performance than the state-of-the-art in capturing currents up to and beyond 30 MHz for use in emerging high-frequency power converter applications utilizing wide bandgap semiconductors. The proposed sensor combines complementary magnetoresisor and Rogowski coil technology along with magnetic concentrators into a single chip. By combining these previously underexplored technologies in discrete current sensing would result in a non-invasive, lossless current sensor for MHz converters, where today none exists. Phase I objectives will address technical challenges in developing a chip-scale integrated sensor, including miniaturized Rogowski coil design and magnetic concentrator shape and material evaluation for signal amplification and electromagnetic interference rejection. Design of the analog signal conditioning circuits required for the integrated circuits are also part of this phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.<br/><br/>The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This should advance collaborative, cross-disciplinary research on nanomechanics and further accelerate the progress in the field, both in terms of fundamental studies and applications. Graduate students and research associates are especially welcome at the conference. To attract them, information about the conference was broadly disseminated, and colleagues were asked to encourage their students and postdocs to attend. There are already 32 graduate students participating in the workshop, which is roughly one-third of the entire participant cohort. The participants are limited to 110 scientists to ensure lively interaction and full participation throughout. The remaining two-thirds of the participants are roughly divided equally between postdocs and senior scientists (either professorial faculty, or professional scientific researchers). The scholarships expected from this grant are intended to be provided to prospective students and postdocs. This should significantly increase and enhance the participation of students and postdocs at the workshop. Steps have been taken to encourage members of the underrepresented groups to attend as well. A measure of success of this effort is that, along with female invited speakers, a female graduate student has been chosen to give an oral contributed talk, which is an exceptional opportunity for a student given the level of the conference.<br/><br/>The workshop FNS/2019 comes from the challenges that are posed by nanomechanical systems. They include, but are not limited to, (i) the occurrence of comparatively strong quantum and classical fluctuations and (ii) the vibration nonlinearity. Along with the invariably present thermal fluctuations, NEMS are subject to nonequilibrium fluctuations. Characterizing and understanding these fluctuations, as well as revealing their consequences is complicated and requires developing new techniques. At the same time, because of the small system size, vibrations with even comparatively small amplitudes become nonlinear, with the nonlinearity often coming into play already for thermal fluctuations. Addressing these challenges requires concerted international effort.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its major research themes are: a) wind hazards assessments; b) estimation of exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructures; and c) improvement of community resilience. Within these themes the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) will select the projects based on their priorities and the Center?s faculty specialties and expertise. Texas Tech University (TTU), as one of founding sites of the WHIP Center, has had an ongoing wind related research program for forty-eight years and supports a broad array of facilities including Ka-band mobile radars, 200m met tower, low-rise test building, wind tunnel, tornado simulator, and debris impact facility. The projects will leverage these facilities along with analytical models to build a strong linkage to fundamental research and technological innovation. Dual-Doppler radar and in-situ anemometry can measure and validate microscale surface winds in landfalling hurricanes. Fragility curves generated from tornado simulator could be quickly transitioned into design standards and building codes. Aerodynamic database of wind tunnel data would help formulating probability distributions of pressure on building components for differentiating wind-water damage in hurricanes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet they regulate a large body of social behavior and also help to pattern social inequality.  This project will advance our scientific understanding of inequality by developing a new approach that identifies social norms in written texts describing correct behaviors. The project will inductively derive the relationships between behaviors prescribed and proscribed in the texts and more measurable dimensions of inequality, such as social class. The project will also uncover the connections between those written norms and the social boundaries and exclusions that create inequality.  The project will inform understanding regarding the pervasiveness of social inequality that has previously been resistant to scientific study and will provide evidence regarding how social norms change over time.<br/> <br/>The project will study social norms through analysis of an original digital corpus consisting of texts describing correct behaviors. The corpus includes more than 7 million words and 90,000 pages of text produced during the last 95 years. The research uses multiple methods including corpus linguistics analytic techniques of topic modeling, word embedding, word network mapping, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. These strategies will identify social norms, symbolic boundaries, techniques for the enforcement of norm compliance, and narratives of justification attaching moral values to social norms. Machine learning will be guided by and supplement traditional by-hand content analysis of texts from the same corpus. The project will also use archival research to place the research findings in their social and historical contexts. Through these methods, the research will produce a new approach to studying social norms and inequality. The results will fuel discussion of the cultural foundations of social inequality as well as shed light on how social norms generally both operate and evolve historically.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technological advance has the potential to revolutionize species identification to prevent species extinction, to protect consumers and our food supply, and to combat threats to global biodiversity. The innovation's commercial potential includes improving the safety and sustainability of our supply chains, combatting costly environmental fraud, and detecting pests and pathogens that threaten our nation's economy, security, and health. The initial market opportunity is to address unmet demand from seafood suppliers, distributors, and retailers; government regulators and enforcement agents; and conservation and natural resources entities, for increased transparency and integrity of seafood supply chains by ending seafood mislabeling and fraud, which occurs in over 30% the $17.1 billion dollar U.S. seafood market and is worth up to $250,000 per illegal import.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop the customizable DNA collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge that enables a user to go from tissue sample to species identification in a single device.

However, the transition of this technology from academia to industry has been stymied by lack of CNT material that meets the manufacturing requirements particularly in terms of alignment, purity, and compatibility to be properly explored. Monolithic 3D integration will enable game-changing levels of improvement to computing speed and power efficiency, creating better computing for all. Providing a material which accelerates research and development for improved computing will create a game changing impact on the $500B integrated circuit market and potentially create billions of dollars in revenue.

This will allow application oriented nanoelectronics teams to move forward with R&D projects. Further, the project's work on the fundamentals of aligned CNT growth and purification will benefit the CNT materials community by the extension of the material into commercial manufacturing. The research objectives are on two fronts: 1) growth of CMOS compatible aligned CNTs and 2) purification of aligned CNTs. Growth of highly aligned CNT populations has typically utilized catalysts which are not compatible with front end of line CMOS fabrication, hindering the use of material in conjunction with Si integrated circuits. Current methods of CNT purification to remove metallic CNTs suffer from either destroying the critical CNT alignment, utilization of non-CMOS compatible materials, or the need of extensive post-processing.

It has potential to reduce the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site and landfilled by up to 85% as well as completely destroy odors and pathogens.  As a result, the project may also enhance social justice throughout the country.  Currently, low-income and disadvantaged communities inherit waste from other communities, sometimes very far away from where the waste originated.  They inherit the stench, the vectors (rats, flies, birds) and toxins.  For example, 7% of the biosolids produced by New York City end up in Alabama, via trains and trucks.  People living near the landfills and along transportation routes no longer use their porch because of the stench.  By improving the economics of a technology that destroys organics much better than state-of-the-art technologies, wastewater treatment plants will become cleaner, less malodorous and use less energy.  Other markets could open as well including clean power and chemical manufacturing. Finally, the project may lead to increased hiring of employees over the next three years. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an affordable and reliable process to cleanly and completely destroy organic waste, extract more resources and energy from sludge and biosolids at wastewater treatment plants while considerably reducing the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site for disposal.  This objective will be achieved by improving a process that uses water contained within the waste to create a hyper oxidative environment.  Similar processes use costly and hazardous pure oxygen, are extremely energy intensive, and are plagued with high maintenance cost.  By making innovations in energy recovery, the use of air as an oxidant instead of oxygen is possible without the large cost associated with having to heat and compress an entire air stream- oxygen plus inert nitrogen. Once optimal technical conditions for energy recovery are identified, the project will enter the design and fabrication phases. The resulting new energy recovery module will be added to an existing system. The prototype will be tested for continuous operation. New insights into energy recovery will be gained, which will benefit the scientific community as a whole.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will support technological development to investigate tiny mineral inclusions in diamonds. A new suite of more than 150 diamonds of deep origin, which formed at depths greater than 410 km in the transition zone and the lower mantle, will be investigated. 3D imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy of the hosted inclusions will be carried out at national X-ray and infrared facilities.

One of the major challenges pertains to determining the depth origin of the diamonds which often lack a complete suite of mineral inclusions to pinpoint their formation conditions. Up to a thousand inclusions will be analyzed potentially promoting the discovery of new mineral phases and providing information about how deeply water is transported into the mantle. New micro-analysis techniques will increase the rate and decrease the size of inclusions that can be studied, thus broadening the database of mantle mineralogy. Spectroscopic methods will probe various types of atomic-scale defects in diamonds as tracers for their depth of origin. Separately, the sound velocity of diamond will be measured at high pressure in all directions of the structure to determine diamond elastic properties. This will improve the geophysical modeling of seismic wave velocity in the deep, crustal roots below continents.

Users integrate their new knowledge of language use into practice tools derived from the field of applied linguistics. These tools help users analyze and discover language use patterns that are used to effectively structure a scientific argument. Automated feedback then guides users toward more purposeful analysis of writing. Studies have demonstrated that these tools can heighten user?s awareness of how to construct an original research argument while increasing their self-efficacy in becoming successful published research writers.  Furthermore, the tools have helped users become more independent writers, requiring users to seek less guidance about writing from research mentors who need the extra time to focus on their own research agendas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without touch feedback, prosthetic users tend to avoid manipulating many objects they otherwise could because they run the risk of destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research will yield a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million people with hand amputations worldwide and improve their quality of life.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the sockets of hand prosthetics to give users useful sensory feedback. The stimulator will integrate with existing prosthetic control systems. It will be built using standard off-the-shelf components, have a form factor small enough to easily fit into a variety of different prosthetic sockets, and operate for at least 12 hours while operating alongside a prosthetic hand and its control system. To improve sensation quality, a sensation controller that enables consistent long-term stimulation will be deployed, reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The expected outcomes of this research are 1) a portable, cost effective and energy efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the socket of a prosthetic user and integrated with their prosthetic hand; and 2) a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for daily manipulation tasks.

The market for this commercial submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies.

Their genomes may harbor many more novel antibiotics. However, harnessing the full biosynthetic capacity of these microorganisms for drug and agrichemical discovery is challenging. This is because the majority of their biosynthetic gene clusters lack detectable products in the laboratory.  This phenomenon, where predicted metabolic pathways fail to yield expected products, is termed biosynthetic silence.  Representing one of the greatest biotechnological challenges to bioactive molecule discovery, biosynthetic silencing effectively hides much-needed new molecules from product development. This NSF CAREER project is designed to reveal the biological underpinnings of biosynthetic silence.  Doing this will reveal new models of metabolic regulation that will be useful for activating silent genes and isolating their products for human gain. Importantly, this project demands a multidisciplinary approach and creates immersive scientific education opportunities at the high school, undergraduate and graduate school levels.  <br/><br/>Using polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PTM) biosynthetic clusters as a model, this proposal probes the mechanisms responsible for biosynthetic cluster silencing in filamentous actinobacteria. PTM molecules have therapeutically interesting activities and their biosynthetic loci are well- conserved among these organisms. This commonality enables comparative metabologenomics across actinomycete families. Systematic assessment of PTM production within the Streptomyces griseus clade by the PI's group suggests silencing is determined by two interacting mechanisms: transcriptional regulation and metabolic control.  Lessons learned from characterizing these mechanisms will be extended to actinobacteria outside of the S. griseus group towards understanding the evolution and induction of secondary metabolic regulation. Together, this work represents the first systematic application of comparative metabologenomics to reveal specific molecular-genetic and metabolic causes of biosynthetic silencing. Mechanistic understanding will likely reveal new strategies for therapeutic and agrichemical discovery via synthetic biology, fundamental for development of enhanced producing strains and more robust microbial functional genomic understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful completion of the proposed project will constitute the foundation of a medical instrument that will improve treatment strategies for cancer patients. Assigning the optimal therapy for individual patients is particularly important for the treatment of cancer, since every individual's cancer is unique. Although genetic profiling of tumor cells has been the gold standard for personalized medicine approaches in cancer, recent results demonstrate that only a small percentage of patients actually benefit from therapies specifically assigned for them. Aside from few cancer types, where drastic patient responses can be observed using genetic profiling, most cancer patients continue to suffer from ineffective or sub-optimal therapies, which in one of the main drivers of the cost of cancer treatment in the US. This stands in stark contrast to personalized medicine in infectious diseases, where almost all patients are prescribed optimal treatments determined by functional assays based on monitoring the proliferation of microbes ex vivo under the influence of a panel of drugs. Unfortunately, no proliferation-based test for cancer has proven to be sufficiently reliable to be widely adopted for clinical use, mostly because unlike bacteria most cancer cells quickly die when removed from the human body. This SBIR Phase I project will develop the techniques to measure MAR of cancer cells as a metric for drug response. MAR response reflects how individual cells change their growth in response to drugs in very short timescales without the long-term effects of ex vivo culturing. The research that will be conducted in this project will prove the technical feasibility of measuring MAR in a clinical setting for a panel of treatment options. Outcomes of this project will directly enable clinical studies to be conducted, before ultimately seeking FDA approval through clinical trials. <br/><br/>The focus of this project is a new technology known as the serial Suspended Microchannel Resonator (sSMR), which can measure mass and mass accumulation rates (MAR) of single cells with extreme precision. This SBIR Phase I project will test the technical feasibility of the sSMR platform for measuring drug susceptibility of primary tumor samples with a clinically and commercially relevant speed, versatility and robustness. The company aims to develop sSMR as a platform and introduce MAR as biophysical biomarker guiding clinicians in identifying the best therapy options for a specific cancer patient. Therefore, the goals of this first phase are critical, as tumor cells in biopsy samples taken from patients show differences in heterogeneity, count, and in most cases, lose their viability within 24-48 ex vivo. In Phase I, key technologies will be developed that will enable a sSMR chip to process samples with various cell types and counts at a high throughput and rate. The research activities to address the technical challenges for analyzing primary samples will be three-fold. First, while maintaining the measurement precision, the flow rate of cells in the chip will be increased to prevent primary tumor cells from adhering to channel walls. This is challenging, because the precision of measurement is inversely proportional to the time duration each cell spends in the chip. Second, an opto-fluidic switching technique will be implemented on chips with a new microfluidic T-junction design enabling imaging and characterization of particle morphology, and the avoidance of dead cells, debris, and doublets to improve assay robustness and throughput. Third, by leveraging the microfluidic T-junction and developed imaging capabilities, a microfluidic cell enrichment technique will be developed. This feature will allow for a larger panel of drug conditions to be tested on tumor biopsies with limited cell counts. For validation of these innovations, response of tumor cells taken from 10 multiple myeloma patients to a panel of three drugs and their combinations will be measured and analyzed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing conditions. This project will overcome these limitations by exploiting the unique self-assembly behavior of zwitterionic copolymers to achieve ultrathin, uniformly porous films in both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms.

Key to this response is the movement of RNA, a type of genetic information, from one part of the plant to another.  However, detailed understanding of how RNA moves in plants is not well understood due to the small amounts of transiting RNAs.  In addition, nearly all of our knowledge comes from research on short-lived plants and very little is known about long-lived trees due to the time it takes to grow and study them. The discovery of a novel virus-like RNA (called CYVaV) that infects virtually all citrus varieties provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore the biology of trees and the movement of RNA in plants.  CYVaV accumulates to high levels in tree veins and moves in the absence of specific virus-produced ""movement"" proteins.  Since CYVaV RNA must use the trees molecular machinery to move its RNA, it is an ideal system to study RNA movement.  This project uses CYVaV to develop technologies to understand the movement of RNAs in plants.  In addition, CYVaV may enable researchers to introduce genetic elements in trees.  An important broader impact is the possibility of using CYVaV as a vehicle to combat the bacterial disease Citrus Greening by targeting the bacteria and the insect depositing the bacteria.  This could help save the US citrus industry from Citrus Greening.<br/><br/>Recent revelations that 50% of the companion cell (CC) transcriptome is moving long distances through sieve elements (SE) have elicited numerous questions concerning how and why this migration of mRNAs is occurring.  Answering key questions on intracellular and intercellular movement of mRNAs requires a model system consisting of an abundant mobile RNA, whose location can be traced in living tissue under different cellular conditions. The recently discovered Citrus yellow vein associated virus (CYVaV) is a highly unusual virus-like RNA that traffics bi-directionally through the phloem of all commercial varieties of citrus and laboratory host Nicotiana benthamiana in the absence of encoded movement proteins (MPs), coat protein or silencing suppressors.  This project develops CYVaV as a model for transiting mRNAs using MS2 CP and &lambda;N22 systems and as a VIGS vector to study effects of altered gene expression in citrus phloem.   CYVaV causes few if any symptoms on citrus although it accumulates to levels detectable on ethidium-stained gels in infected plants.  This should allow for high level expression of small RNAs, with the initial goal of down regulating CC callose synthase, which causes callose deposition in SE during stress or pathogen invasion.  Since CYVaV should have no host-MP specific incompatibility, it will also be examined for an extended host range in other woody plants and vines, which currently have no useable vectors.  By studying CYVaV movement and ability to serve as a VIGS vector, one broader impact of this work is using CYVaV to block the devastating effects of Citrus Greening.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Funding in this travel proposal will support approximately 24 U.S. students, early career scientists, and members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Ground motion simulation and, more recently, dynamic rupture modeling are at the heart of seismic hazard calculations and studies of earthquake source processes. A wide range of numerical methods are being used, and there are growing efforts to perform verification and validation of the simulation codes. In addition, researchers are now routinely performing dynamic rupture simulations of actual earthquakes and slow slip events, addressing questions about how ruptures navigate fault geometric complexities; the role of friction, pore fluid pressure, inelastic material response, and dynamic weakening mechanisms on rupture nucleation, propagation, and arrest; etc. This international workshop will bring together modelers from different countries with observational seismologists and experimentalists, facilitating exchange of scientific knowledge and ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, overdose deaths now claim three to four times more American lives each year than homicide and more deaths annually than the AIDS epidemic did at its peak.  Although the drug overdose crisis has affected people across all locations and walks of life, research shows that this illegal drug epidemic is concentrated in some communities and demographic groups but not others.  Little research has been conducted, however, on why some places and populations are more vulnerable to experiencing drug overdoses.  In addition, little is known about whether the community sources of fatal drug overdoses are the same as those that shape homicide and suicide rates.  This project will address these questions by identifying the community characteristics that contribute to drug overdose death concentrations across locales, time, and demographic groups, both alone and compared to the community sources of homicide and suicide.  In so doing, this project provides one of the most comprehensive, nationwide analyses examining the community-level sources of drug overdose deaths to date.  It also will equip researchers and policy makers with information that can be used to combat the drug overdose epidemic by targeting community-level conditions for intervention and assisting those places and groups that are most susceptible to drug overdose concentrations.  <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>This project will compile a unique database using approximately 25 years of nationally-representative mortality data on overdose deaths, homicides, and suicides drawn from the Center for Disease Control Restricted-Access Multiple Cause of Death Mortality data from 1990 to 2016.  These data will be aggregated and combined with measures of community social, economic, and health indicators drawn from multiple databases including: the U.S. Census Bureau, Center for Disease Control prescription data, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation community health data.  Using fixed effects change-score models, these combined data will be used to identify the community sources of overdose death rates across: (1) aggregate study units (e.g., county, metropolitan areas); (2) time (1990-2016); (3) substance type (heroin, natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids, cocaine, psychostimulants); and (4) demographic groups (race/ethnicity, age, gender).  These analyses will be replicated for both homicide and suicide to identify whether the community-level determinants of death are unique for each form of mortality, or whether there are common factors that similarly predict overdose, homicide, and suicide death rates.  Hybrid time series models will also be used to address limitations of fixed effects modeling.  Findings from this project will contribute to greater understanding of ecological theories of crime by testing relevant hypotheses using dependent variables reflecting drug overdose, homicide, and suicide rates, which include outcomes previously understudied within this theoretical framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And when formal legal policies change, the reforms generally get implemented in distinct and divergent ways by local court actors, sometimes in ways inconsistent with policy goals. This project capitalizes upon recent major policy changes imposed in the federal criminal system by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine how different court ""communities"" have responded to the changes. Specifically, new policies have been developed urging prosecutors to focus on certain kinds of federal crimes, and that require prosecutors across the country to maximize the potential punishment. While the DOJ policies aim for standardized prosecutorial practices across the diverse federal district courts, prior research suggests that local courts will vary in how they translate these directives into action.  <br/> <br/>The study builds directly upon the PI's previous NSF-funded research that examined jurisdictional differences in adjudication strategies in federal court, using both qualitative field methods and quantitative methods. The project revisits the same research sites (4 geographically and demographically diverse federal districts) to assess whether and how the current DOJ policy impacts caseload characteristics (including defendant demography) and adjudication practices and outcomes, with a focus on how formal top-down policy is translated into localized, on-the-ground legal action. Using interviews, observations, and administrative data from the federal courts, the project tests three related hypotheses: 1) Despite the return to policies that aim to control local practices through top-down mandates, adaptations will be localized in practice. Between-district variations will continue to be evident in four distinct sets of practices: case selection; prosecutorial charging practices; terms and modes of plea agreements; and formal sentencing practices. 2) Within-district, demographic composition of the caseload, the application of prosecutorial-controlled sentencing tools, and sentence lengths will change as a function of temporal period, but local adjudication norms will temper such change. 3) The degree of change in local practice norms will be greater in the current policy period (beginning May, 2017) than the previous one (2010-2017) because the current policy authorizes increased punishment for defendants and includes local compliance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In answering these questions, this project not only addresses the application areas, but also develops insights to tackle long-standing open questions in coding theory.  This project is interdisciplinary, and includes a synergistic education plan aimed at bringing together students from different backgrounds.  The education plan incorporates course development of both graduate and undergraduate courses at Stanford University as well as training for graduate students and research opportunities for undergraduates.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on four new lenses into coding theory, motivated by applications in distributed storage, cryptography, algorithm design and pseudorandomness.  Each of these lenses raises new fundamental questions in coding theory.  These questions fall broadly into the categories of ""locality"" and ""list-decoding.""  Informally, locality refers to the ability to decode a small part of the original data from only a small amount of encoded data.  List-decoding refers to the setting where there is so much noise that the original data cannot be uniquely determined, and the decoder must do the best it can to narrow the possibilities to a relatively short list.  By answering these new fundamental questions, this research will both make progress on the motivating applications and will also develop new theory illuminating the structure of locality and list-decoding in error correcting codes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today large scale solar generation (the majority of all solar energy) is almost exclusively by large farms of photovoltaic (PV) panels made from silicon cells, as used also for rooftop solar. The research is aimed at enhancing scientific and technological understanding of an alternative approach that exploits a different, much more efficient type of PV cell.? It promises lower cost electricity in sunny climates around the world, from longer lived plants using less land. The potential societal impact is broader adoption of solar electricity both in the US and across the world, and thus reduced global pollution. The commercial impact of the project is also huge. In the targeted global market, $30 billion now is spent annually on new solar installations and an increase to $100 billion is projected. This is an opportunity for the US to re-establish itself as a world leader in solar manufacturing, of both the different PV cells that underlie our approach, and the optical and mechanical systems that are the target of this research and are key to cost reduction.?<br/><br/>The proposed project will explore a new approach to solar electricity generation, using advanced photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity with twice the efficiency of silicon PV panels. The innovation is in the system used to focus sunlight on the cells as needed?for highest efficiency at lowest cost. The advanced PV cells themselves have already been developed for spacecraft, but previous efforts to commercialize them for ground use have failed, because the systems needed to provide concentrated sunlight were too expensive. The research will be directed to developing, building and testing the two innovative elements critical to a complete, low cost system: 1) Small glass lens arrays used at the focus of large dish reflectors to apportion sunlight equally onto individual small cells. Existing commercial glass molding methods do not yield arrays of the size and precision needed; a new molding method tailored specifically for the task will be developed. 2) A novel mechanical structure will be developed to orient the mirrors toward the sun throughout the day with minimal use of steel, by employing an efficient spaceframe structure turning on a ground track, and a sensor-feedback system to eliminate conventional, heavy, rigid bearings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Debugging is often challenging, as developers must generate possible hypotheses about a failure's cause, laboriously test hypotheses by reasoning about the behavior of complex code, and use debugging tools to generate and identify relevant runtime state. These challenges may be manifest to software users as software with unfixed defects and increased software cost. In addition, expert developers have knowledge which, if extracted, would be valuable in helping to debug more easily. Experts have long been shown to do even simple programming tasks over ten times more quickly than non-experts, largely because they have seen similar situations before. This project addresses the question of the nature of mental models of debugging and the creation of a scientific foundation for understanding, externalizing, and sharing expert insight into the runtime behavior of programs.<br/><br/>This project encompasses a comprehensive set of activities for conducting studies of software developers and designing new forms of debugging tools.  A broad sample of developers will be observed to collect sketches capturing mental models from debugging tasks, abstract common building blocks, and count the frequency of these building blocks. New types of debugging tools will be designed which enable developers to externalize their mental models by recording, abstracting, and replaying queries over program executions and visualizing relationships between elements within program executions. New debugging tools will be evaluated through user studies to understand if and how developers may externalize and share their debugging mental models. Together, these activities will deepen the scientific understanding of how developers debug and create new techniques for developers to work more effectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To predict when and where melting snow will be available, water managers need to know how much snow is in the mountains and where it is located. But snow is not the same depth everywhere, so comprehensive estimates are required. Unfortunately, manual measurements of snow are too hard because of access problems, and methods to measure snow from satellites are still being developed. One challenge faced by satellites is trees. Satellites can't usually see snow through a forest.  In winter 2019, NASA is testing new sensors for measuring snow from aircrafts by repeatedly flying over 13 flight regions throughout the western US. The sensors will provide snow depth and water content data approximately every 3 meters of very large areas. One flight path covers an experimental field site near Boise, Idaho were scientists have a long history of studying mountain hydrology.  This project will investigate the relationships between mountain forests and snow by making new meteorological measurements in forest at the same time that NASA is collecting unprecedented snow depth data.  Knowledge gained can be used to improve critical water supply forecasting methods.<br/><br/>Mountain snow provides the dominant water supply from most of the western US; understanding the processes and properties that control the accumulation and melt of snow is crucial for science and society. The patterns of snow accumulation and melt are impacted by many climate and terrain factors that challenge scientist's abilities to model and forecast snow-derived water supply. Foremost among the challenges is the impact that forests have on the timing of melt. In some regions forests preserve snow while in others they enhance melt. Obtaining data at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to answer important questions about the impact of forests on snow is typically financially and logistically prohibitive. In winter 2019, the NASA SNOWEX project will obtain snow depth data at 3 m spatial resolution every two weeks through the accumulation and melt season.  With additional ground-based data collected during these campaigns, it will be possible to answer some critical questions about forest-snow interactions. The objective of this research is to collect distributed longwave radiation data coincident with spatially and temporally distributed snow distribution data. Specifically, the project seeks to answer how spatially variable longwave radiation in forested and open environments impact accumulation and melt in relatively cold vs relatively warm snowy environments. An array of radiometers will be deployed to measure the spatial distribution of longwave radiation at the snow surface under forest canopies of different density through the snow accumulation and melt seasons. Coupling the high resolution NASA snow depth and water content data with distributed radiation data funded by this project fill a critical knowledge gap in the science of snow-vegetation interactions, provide training for one PhD student and two undergraduate students, and connect to a well-established education and outreach programs at Boise State University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to use this newly developed approach that couples a variety of environmental stresses with traditional plant clonal propagation techniques to produce maize plants with enhanced stress resistance. This project is a joint collaboration between the Schmitz Laboratory at the University of Georgia and the Gutierrez-Marcos Laboratory at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and is supported as part of the Breakthrough Technologies competition, which is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. The ability to uncover stress-responsive variation using this novel, clonal plant propagation strategy could lead to a rapid improvement of stress resilient maize varieties. In addition to the agricultural impact, this project will fund graduate student training in experimental and computational biology. The graduate students will participate in mentoring high-school summer intern students from the Young Dawgs program sponsored by the University of Georgia. These students will focus on biological computer programming. Additionally, hands-on workshops for experimental biology will be hosted at the University of Warwick through the Nuffield Foundation Research Program to inspire students and teachers to explore the area of plant biotechnology. <br/><br/>This project aims to create Zea mays plants with enhanced responses to abiotic and biotic stresses.

Transcriptome analyses will be performed to assess the functional significance of the stress-induced epigenetic variation a transcriptome analysis on regenerated plants. For the induced epigenetic variation to be relevant it must be stable over generations. Therefore, the stability of induced epigenetic variation by studying the DNA methylome and transcriptome of progeny plants derived from clonal regenerants will be assessed. In parallel, phenotypic characterization of the regenerant plants and their progeny in comparison to controls will be carried out to determine if enhanced responses to stress exist. These results will potentially lead to novel methodologies for inducing novel yet stable epigenetic variation, thus enabling innovative avenues for trait improvement in maize and possibly other crop species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hurricane Michael produced numerous overwash areas along Cape San Blas and opened a new pass from the Gulf of Mexico to St. Joseph Bay. This will likely alter salinities and water temperatures and bring additional larval and adult recruits to the Bay.

No other hydrologic science meeting is focused on this goal. The Catchment Science GRC, has taken place biennially since 1991 and continues to represent a unique opportunity for scientists from academic institutions and government agencies from around the world in this field. The GRC on Catchment Science and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS, for early career scientists and students) includes members from broad ranging disciplines but maintains a focus on interactions among hydrology, biology and geochemistry in catchment science. The conference will identify new research opportunities and define new research questions in catchment science from an integrative, multidisciplinary standpoint. <br/><br/>The Gordon Conference on Catchment Science is a biennial event that draws an international audience and mixes established researchers with new investigators. This year's conference theme is ""Transcending the Uniqueness of Place in the Age of Big Data"" and will examine how process research and large-scale, high resolution modeling can be used to advance scientific understanding. Unraveling catchment functions and transferring knowledge to other sites requires an integrated physical, chemical, and biological perspective. The Gordon Research Conference and the Gordon Research Seminar on Catchment Science are designed with a format that favors discussion, interaction, and a focus on cutting edge, interdisciplinary science. The conference fosters exchange among hydrologists, ecologists, engineers, soil scientists, and biogeochemists.  The conference will enable catchment scientists from different disciplines to share and learn from one another in order to identify opportunities for research and scientific advancement. The conference will host a pre-conference Graduate Research Seminar where young investigators can discuss their work and gain valuable one-on-one council from investigators at a more advanced career stage. The Graduate Research Seminar provides opportunities for the exchange of ideas among early career investigators and the opportunity to build relationships with peers that will form the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disturbances can affect the behavior of marine mammals, yet associated physiological costs remain unknown. Because their impressive capacity for diving is based on specialized physiology, it is likely that physiological costs limit and define the sensitivity of marine mammals to disturbances. This project will investigate variability of dive physiology in northern elephant seals by using experimental at-sea disturbances that elicit responses to noise - a stressor of global concern. The methods build on state-of-the-art logging technologies and will develop a new probe that will be capable of detecting oxygen management in the body. Cardiovascular physiology and oxygen use of the seals will be measured during routine diving, and compared with animals that experience a remote experimental disturbance while at sea. The project goal is to understand the physiological range and limits of this species, and to provide data that could predict marine mammal resilience to natural and anthropogenic stressors. These data will have wide-reaching implications for sensitive ecosystems and other species of concern that are not easily studied. It will be directly applicable to conservation and management of marine species and habitats. The project will train undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and will include extensive public outreach via state parks, and a public aquarium. <br/><br/>Environmental changes, including noise pollution, represent a fundamental challenge to the structure and sustainable function of marine ecosystems. The goal of this project is to identify physiological variability in the oxygen management of a diving seal that can be directly linked to individual success in the ocean. The project's three objectives will be achieved using at-sea data collected from translocated juvenile elephant seals, via integrated measurements of cardiovascular physiology (EKG and oxygen sensors in blood or muscle) with simultaneously collected time-depth records and 3-dimensional acceleration data to interpret underwater activity. Objective 1 will provide the first comprehensive picture of the dive phenotype in the open ocean by characterizing interrelationships among heart rate, blood oxygen depletion, muscle perfusion, and fine scale dive behavior. It will also assess molecular markers of perfusion capability in muscles with different underwater oxygen demands. Objectives 2 & 3 are based on experimentally inducing the behavioral effects of acoustic disturbance observed in many aquatic species - extended dive durations and increased cost of transport. Both objectives will examine oxygen management strategies in response to stimuli. Comparing natural versus perturbed dives permits an assessment of individual plasticity in the dive phenotype, incorporating behavior and physiology. This is a critical first step in determining the capacity of a model species to extend diving, their response to at-sea disruptions in natural dive patterns, and, ultimately, to predict thresholds of disturbance beyond which they cannot compensate."

Currently these systems suffer from underperformance due to an inability to control or diffuse the high-energy content of the blade tip vortex. A major aspect of the project is the large-scale experiments in a unique high-wind hurricane simulator facility at Florida International University that enables flow-similitude and realistic application of the results to full-scale rotor-based systems. Such educational training is vital to increase the pool of experimental thermal-fluids engineers that can continue to improve the efficiency of energy systems for the benefit of society. <br/><br/>The proposed large-scale experiments will test new theories and create new knowledge of high- Reynolds number blade tip vortex breakdown using secondary vortex structures created by synthetic jets and chord-wise wall oscillations. The intellectual significance is a semi-empirical model that describes the characteristics of secondary vortices (e.g. length/ time scales, vorticity) necessary for vortex breakdown to occur, as well as its impact on turbulent kinetic energy, which is believed to induce blade structural vibration. The flow will be measured using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry techniques and analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as well as three-dimensional flow reconstruction from an array of two-dimensional measurement planes. These methods are unique for large-domain high Reynolds number flows. They will be used to shed light on blade tip vortex energy content/ POD modes, as well as to advance the field of experimental vortex dynamics particularly at high Reynolds numbers."

To achieve this, processor vendors have embraced manycore devices, where thousands of cores cooperate on a single chip to solve large-scale problems in a parallel manner. They have further incorporated heterogeneity, combining cores with different architectures on a single chip in a bid to provide ever-increasing performance per watt. This project boosts the search for higher energy-efficient performance by inventing novel cross-core learning techniques. Cores in current chips individually learn about the behavior of parallel programs in order to run programs more efficiently in the future, devoting complex and power-hungry hardware structures to do this. However, this research observes that parallel programs tend to exercise the hardware structures of different cores in correlated ways, meaning that the behavior of the program run on one core can be communicated to other cores for various performance and power benefits. As such, this form of intelligent cross-core information exchange is effective in achieving high performance per watt across computing domains from datacenters to embedded systems<br/><br/>In this light, this research provides techniques to deduce how similarly a parallel program's various threads exercise their cores' hardware structures (looking at a range of different programmer, compiler, and architectural mechanisms to do so). When this is detected, cross-core learning hardware gleans the information that is most useful to exchange to improve performance or power, and then transmits this information among heterogeneous cores using low-overhead hardware/software techniques. This project develops a lightweight runtime software layer to orchestrate this information exchange, relying on dedicated hardware support when necessary. Through developing this framework, cross-core learning is applied to a number of specific cases, ranging from higher-performance manycore cache prefetching and branch prediction, to performance and power-management techniques for interrupts and exceptions in scale-out systems, as well as thread and instruction scheduling.  Furthermore, this project heavily disseminates knowledge on how to design and program large-scale manycore systems (or scale-out systems) by involving students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels through active research and coursework. Overall, this work impacts the engineering community and broader society by: (1) helping to achieve high-performance, but also energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly computing systems; (2) providing academics and chip designers a design methodology and infrastructure to study manycore design; (3) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computer science; (4) educating graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students on parallel programming for manycore systems."

The physiology that permits these animals to sustain extended breath-hold periods and survive the extreme pressure of diving deep allows them to thrive in icy Antarctic waters. Key elements of their physiological specializations to breath-hold diving are their ability for remarkable adjustment of their heart and blood vessel system, coordinating blood pressure and flow to specific body regions based on their metabolic requirements, and their ability to sustain periods without oxygen. Identifying the details of these strategies has tremendous potential to better inform human medicine, helping us to develop novel therapies for cardiovascular trauma (e.g. stroke, heart attack) and diseases associated with blunted oxygen delivery to tissues (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis, or cancer). The goal of this project is to document specific genes that control these cardiovascular adjustments in seals, and to compare their abundance and activity with humans. Specifically, the investigators will study a signaling pathway that coordinates local blood flow. They will also use tissue samples to generate cultured cells from Weddell seals that can be used to study the molecular effects of low oxygen conditions in the laboratory. The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project will train a pre-veterinary student researcher will conduct public outreach via a center for community health improvement, a multicultural affairs office, and a public aquarium. <br/><br/>The goal of this study is to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the dive response. A hallmark of the dive response is tissue-specific vascular system regulation, likely resulting from variation in both nerve inputs and in production of local signaling molecules produced by blood vessel cells. The investigators will use emerging genomic information to begin to unravel the genetics underlying redistribution of the circulation during diving. They will also directly test the hypothesis that modifications in the signaling system prevent local blood vessel changes under low oxygen conditions, thereby allowing the centrally mediated diving reflex to override local physiological responses and to control the constriction of blood vessel walls in Weddell seals. They will perform RNA-sequencing of Weddell seal tissues and use the resulting sequence, along with information from other mammals such as dog, to obtain a full annotation (identifying all genes based on named features of reference genomes) of the existing genome assembly for the Weddell seal, facilitating comparative and species-specific genomic research. They will also generate a Weddell seal pluripotent stem cell line which should be a valuable research tool for cell biologists, molecular biologists and physiologists that will allow them to further test their hypotheses. It is expected that the proposed studies will advance our knowledge of the biochemical and physiological adaptations that allow the Weddell seal to thrive in the Antarctic environment."

The significant need for an efficient and effective mobile power distribution system became evident during search and rescue/recovery missions following the Japan tsunami and the disappearance of the Malaysia MH370 airplane.  The technology outcomes from this project will apply to a broad range of environments (in space, air, water or on ground) where the success of long-term robotic network missions is measured by the ability of the robots to operate, for an extended period of time, in highly dynamic and potentially hazardous environments. These advanced features will provide the following advantages: efficiency, efficacy, guaranteed persistence, enhanced performance, and increased success in search/rescue/recovery/discovery missions.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the following technology problems as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: inflated energy use currently required when the autonomous vehicles break from mission to return to recharging station; lack of multi-robot coordination needed to take into account both fundamental hardware and network science challenges necessary to respond to energy needs and dynamic environment conditions. By addressing these gaps in technology, this work establishes the theoretical, computational, and experimental foundation for mobile power delivery and onsite recharging capability.  Moreover, the new technology developed in this project is universally adaptable for disparate autonomous vehicles especially autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In more technical terms, this project creates network optimization and formation strategies that will enable a power distribution system to reconfigure itself depending on the number of operational autonomous vehicles and recharging specifications to meet overall mission specifications, the energy consumption needs of the network, situational conditions, and environmental variables. Such a system will play a vital role in real-time controlled applications across multiple disciplines such as sensor networks, robotics, and transportation systems where limited power resources and unknown environmental dynamics pose major constraints. In addition to addressing technology gaps, undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this research and will receive interdisciplinary education/ innovation/ technology translation/ outreach experiences through: developing efficient network energy routing, path planning and coordination strategies; designing and creating experimental test-beds and educational platforms; and engaging K-12th grade students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math including those from underrepresented groups.  <br/><br/>This project engages Michigan Tech's Great Lake Research Center (GLRC) and Center for Agile Interconnected Microgrids (AIM) to develop experimental test-beds and conduct tests that validate the resulting methods and algorithms, and ultimately, facilitate the technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

To develop these resources in a cost-effective manner, it is vital to understand the plumbing of these reservoirs-specifically how big the pores (open spaces) are in the rocks, how well they are connected, and what kind of fluids they hold. This study focuses on small pores, called micropores, to understand how they form, and how they change as they are buried in the Earth. This knowledge will allow people such as farmers, water plant managers, and the oil and gas industry to drill fewer wells, increasing their economic competitiveness and decreasing disturbances to the environment and people. Micropores are also responsible for premature deterioration of roads constructed with crushed limestone. Therefore, the results from this work could lead to more robust highways, reducing construction and maintenance costs, while providing a safer and smoother ride for drivers. <br/><br/>Previous work shows that most micropores are hosted in a framework of calcite microcrystals. The current research aims to understand the fundamental controls on the textures of these microcrystals in limestones. Numerous generalized pathways for calcite microcrystal formation and evolution have been proposed. None, however, has tied microcrystal texture to diagenetic process in a robust manner. Our aim is to integrate laboratory experiments, advanced imaging, and high-resolution geochemical techniques to better understand the diagenesis of calcite microcrystals and thus the micropores between them. Specifically, we propose to use experiments and a wide variety of natural samples to assess the geochemical heterogeneity and genetic evolution of the various calcite microcrystal textures. We hypothesize that spatial variations in microcrystal chemistry will reveal that the different microcrystal textures correlate to positions along a diagenetic trajectory of increasing cementation (i.e., microcrystal textures become more fitted with progressive burial and cementation).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the chemical composition and size distribution of living and non-living particles in the ocean have an enormous impact on marine ecosystems, including the dynamics of marine food chains, the vertical transmission of solar energy, and the transport of organic matter and trace elements.  These particle characteristics not only affect but reflect changes in many biogeochemical processes in the ocean.  In this project, a team of scientists will launch a set of technical and numerical modeling innovations that will allow them to determine key biogeochemical quantities from optical observations of the angular distribution of scattered light.  The project will involve an interdisciplinary team of experts, who will theoretically model the optics of marine particles, develop an innovative advanced mathematical modeling scheme, and then laboratory- and field-test and validate the approach for observing marine particle properties. <br/><br/>When perfected, the technique should see a broader application, as it will be designed to be amenable to operation on ship-borne and autonomous platforms with the potential to provide estimates of the particle size distribution and composition at high temporal and spatial resolutions.  It should thus benefit different fields requiring detailed knowledge of aquatic particles (biogeochemistry, biology, optics).  The project will also provide for the training and support of graduate and undergraduate students as well as public educational outreach, including a special effort to reach Native Americans in North Dakota.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to derive water-column quantitative particle size and composition information from in situ unobtrusive volume scattering function (VSF) measurements to characterize marine biogeochemical particulate stocks.  The angular patterns of the scattered intensity and polarization state of the scattered light by particles can be described in terms of a 4x4 Mueller matrix (S) that is intrinsically determined by the sizes, shapes, composition, and structures of the particles. The particle properties can be, therefore, potentially inferred from measurements of S. Unfortunately, the complete Mueller matrix of oceanic waters has been seldom measured. Even the most commonly measured component, the volume scattering function (element S11) representing the angular distribution of unpolarized light, was scarcely measured until recently, followed by development of an inversion technique to derive size distributions and composition of particles from the VSF.  Recently, a commercial product, LISST-VSF, became available for measuring the Mueller matrix components S11 (VSF), S12 (linear polarization), and S22 (cross-polarization), potentially providing an avenue to obtain a much more detailed characterization of particles.  This project will incorporate the additional information provided by S12 and S22 using recent advances in scattering modeling to further constrain the inversion with the following: (i) better knowledge in particle shapes using S22 (spherical vs. non-spherical); (ii) reduced uncertainty using both S11 and S12; and (iii) further improved capability to characterize particles in the size range of 0.02 to 200 um. The study should greatly enhance our ability to quantify size distributions and refractive indices (closely linked to particle densities) for particle groups such as phytoplankton cells, detrital particles, organic particles, mineral particles, bubbles, and emulsified oil (if present)."

Polymer nanostructures can be massively fabricated by nanoimprinting, template infiltration, and electrospinning. A plethora of top-down (etching) and bottom-up (directed- or self-assembly) techniques have been developed for semiconductor nanostructures to meet the needs of microelectronics industry. In contrast, metal nanostructures still require multiple lithographic and thin film deposition steps which are slow and expensive. This award supports fundamental research in the rheology of liquid metals to advance a new nanomanufacturing technique involving tensile deformation and rupture of arrays of liquid metal. The research enables nanolithography-free fabrication of controllable metal nanostructures assembled on various substrates such as metals, glasses, polymers, and semiconductors. The project provides education and hands-on training in metal nanomanufacturing to undergraduate and graduate students and opportunities in engineering to minority students and students with disability. <br/><br/>A variety of shapes such as droplets, thin films, beads-on-a-string, conical structures, and long fibers can be created by deformation of polymer liquids.

However, a similar approach is not applicable to liquid metals because of their low viscosity, high surface tension, and lack of viscoelasticity. These challenges of conventional metals are overcome by using amorphous metals or glass forming metal alloys which exhibit a metastable supercooled liquid state that mimics the rheology of thermoplastics. Effects of viscosity, surface tension, and strain-rate on flow behavior of metallic supercooled liquids are systematically studied. Such knowledge is used to manipulate the supercooled liquid state for high-throughput manufacturing of metal nanostructures by mechanical means. The research work involves extensional or tensile deformation of liquid metal arrays to create high-aspect-ratio and hollow metal nanostructures which are not feasible by existing embossing methods. The glassy or amorphous nanostructures are subsequently devitrified or crystallized for applications which require crystalline metal nanostructures. Besides leading to new applications, this nanomanufacturing project enables fundamental studies on size effects in metallic glasses through performance of thermal, electrical, and mechanical tests on nanoscale specimens."

Recent progress in nanotechnology has reduced the size of silicon transistors down to the order of 10 nanometers. For such small transistors, other physical effects set in, limiting the functionality of the transistors. Novel materials and device concepts are required. Recently, a group of materials called Heusler alloys has been theoretically predicted to be promising for applications. These materials are ferromagnetic and expected to host a new type of massless fundamental particles discovered recently in solid materials, called Weyl fermions. This effort will provide experimental evidence for such exotic states in Heusler alloys. If successful, it would not only advance the knowledge of topological Weyl semimetals, but also likely lead to applications in spintronics. This project also provides the principal investigators with an opportunity to strengthen the education and training in field of discovery and growth of crystalline materials, the importance of which was highlighted in the National Research Council's report ""Frontiers in Crystalline Matter"". <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Recent discoveries of topological Weyl semimetals in non-magnetic materials such as TaAs-class materials, photonic crystals and (W/Mo)Te2 have generated immense interest and attracted worldwide attention. However, ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals have not been experimentally realized yet, though they were predicted to have more exciting properties, e.g. quantum anomalous Hall effect in monolayer ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal. There have been considerable theoretical efforts in predicting ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals and many candidate materials have been proposed. The major objective of this proposed research is to experimentally verify one recently-predicted candidate material system, i.e. Heusler alloy Co2XZ(X=V, Zr, Nb, Ti, Mn, Hf; Z =Si, Ge, Sn, Ga and Al). The principal investigators of this project grow single crystals of various members of the Co2XZ family using the floating-zone, metal flux and chemical vapor transport methods and seek transport and spectroscopic evidences of Weyl fermions in these materials through magneto-transport, Hall effect, quantum oscillation and photoemission spectroscopy experiments. In addition, the principal investigators also study the Weyl states driven by a magnetic field in several half Heusler alloy systems ReMX (Re= rare earth, MX=PdBi and PtSb). The goal of this part of research is to find more field-driven Weyl semimetal states, which could be used as a platform to verify the proposed mechanisms for the field-driven Weyl state and study the dependence of Weyl state on spin-orbital coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Context-free language (CFL) reachability has been widely adopted for specifying program analysis problems. However, little foundational progress exists on advancing the CFL-reachability framework itself. To support precise and scalable program analyses, an expressive, accessible class of formal language reachability is needed to bridge fundamental formal language research and practical analysis-based tool development. The project's novelties are twofold: a new powerful formalism for specifying program analyses, and algorithms and techniques for realizing a practical framework based on this formalism. The project's impacts are deepened knowledge on and improved capabilities for building precise and scalable static analyses, as well as practical analyses for improving software reliability and security.<br/><br/>This project will explore linear conjunctive language (LCL) reachability as a new static analysis formalism.  In contrast to CFLs, LCLs are closed under all set-theoretic operations and can also be efficiently recognized in quadratic time.  A significant number of advanced program analyses need to match properties described by multiple CFLs simultaneously. LCLs can precisely express many such properties, while CFLs cannot because they are not closed under intersection. Thus, LCL reachability offers a novel perspective in specifying and realizing program analyses. The investigators' initial work on LCL-reachability has shown considerable promise, leading to both more precise and orders of magnitude more scalable alias and taint analysis, two widely-used analyses.  This project aims to fully exploit LCL-reachability's potentials by developing a unified solution for specifying program analysis problems in LCL and implementing novel data structures that support efficient LCL-reachability algorithms. It focuses on (1) theoretical development of the LCL-reachability formulation, (2) efficient algorithms for computing LCL-reachability, and (3) generalizing to practical program analyses.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>SRI International (SRI) in partnership with Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall) will conduct an efficacy study of a new comprehensive science curriculum for middle grades 6-8 called Amplify Science Middle School (ASMS). This school science curriculum integrates disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. The overarching aim of the study will be to understand the impact of the curriculum on student achievement, classroom implementation, and teacher practice in relation to the recommendations of ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"" and the Next Generation of Science Standards. While the number of states fully adopting NGSS hovers at around 20, nearly another 20 states have either incorporated the Framework or substantial portions of the NGSS into their state frameworks. Currently, the number of curriculum materials that have been designed for the Framework are relatively few, and thus the efficacy evidence basis for NGSS-designed curricula is limited. As more and more curriculum materials become available for supporting the Framework vision, the science education field needs rigorous research on the efficacy of curricula and the conditions required to implement them. ASMS is the Hall's first comprehensive 6-8 grade curriculum that has been designed specifically to meet the vision of the Framework and NGSS. Field trials of ASMS with more than 475 teachers and 34,000 students in a wide variety of settings, including urban, rural and suburban schools, have shown positive impact on student achievement, providing a compelling reason for a large-scale efficacy trial at this time.<br/><br/>The study will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods within an experimental design that will allow the examination of relations between contextual factors and student learning gains to help explain the results. Thus, this study will be important for moving education researchers toward increased understanding of how to meaningfully study and support teaching and learning in districts that will be trying to implement the next generation of science curriculum materials. Work will be conducted in districts with large numbers of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields so that educators can better understand the promise of NGSS-aligned curricula in promoting access and equity in science education. The research team will conduct a random assignment efficacy study in 7th grade classrooms beginning in academic year 2018-19 and following up with these students as 8th graders in academic year 2019-20. Teachers in both conditions will receive professional development on the NGSS; teachers in the treatment condition will also receive professional development in the use of the ASMS materials. The recruiting target is a sample of 48 middle schools within up to 6 medium to large districts in California and/or Washington. The researchers will attempt to recruit all middle schools and all 7th grade<br/>science teachers in a district. It is anticipated that each school will have an average of two teachers teaching 3 sections of 7th grade science with 30 students per section for an approximate total of 96 teachers and 8,640 students. All students should have opportunities to learn science. This study will aim to draw valid inferences about the impact of curricula in districts with high concentrations of students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. This work will also contribute to the larger, nationwide effort to support standards-based instructional reforms in science by helping to identify conditions needed for successful implementation of NGSS-designed curriculum materials. The findings will provide an important basis for investments in new curriculum materials and will be of strong interest to those in science education and the learning sciences, as well as to district leaders and policymakers concerned with scaling up of rigorous curriculum."

The results will be important to both neuroscience and engineering. On the neuroscience side, the results will address how the brain combines information about movement and touch, thereby improving our understanding of stroke and brain injury. On the engineering side, the work will develop novel robots and sensors that use touch to sense object location, shape, and texture, to track fluid wakes in water, and to sense the direction of airflow. These capabilities will improve the ability of robots to work in challenging environments; for example, robots could explore dark areas more easily or provide surgeons with a better sense of touch during surgery. To train the next generation of scientists and engineers, both undergraduate and graduate students will help construct the robots and will explore industry- and government-related applications of whisker-based touch sensing. The research team will investigate technology transfer opportunities in robotics and medicine, flow sensing, instrument placement, corrosion detection, three-dimensional tactile profilometry, and compliance sensing. <br/><br/>The fundamental scientific rationale for the work is that understanding how animal nervous systems process complex sensory and motor information necessarily requires quantification of the input. However, it is currently impossible for neuroscientists to record from all primary sensory neurons involved in a particular sensorimotor behavior. The three stages of this project exploit the whisker system of mammals in an endeavor to completely quantify whisker-based input and early neural processing in the rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). The first stage of work will focus on the development of modular, reconfigurable, artificial whiskers that can sense both touch and fluid flow. The materials, manufacturing, and sensor designs necessary for whiskers at multiple length scales will be investigated and signals from the whiskers will be represented based on known coding properties of primary whisker-sensitive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The second stage of work will involve the construction of whisker arrays that anatomically match those of the rat and the seal. These arrays will be used to develop combined hardware and software models of the responses of the entire population of TG neurons. Finally, in the third stage of work, the whisker arrays will be mounted on robotic platforms, and the robots will be put through the same head movements as real animals during natural behavior. This process will allow us to simulate the entire TG neuron population response during complex, natural behaviors. Overall, the project will help unlock the basis by which low-level but powerful neural circuits confer animals with flexibility and resourcefulness in sensing and movement.<br/><br/>This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a mulitdisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE)."

A central problem in understanding the origin of the human brain concerns the role of social life and the demands it places on the brain to generate adaptive behavior.  As humans evolved complex societies, it is thought that the brain increased in volume to enable advanced cognition.  Social insects are outstanding models to examine brain evolution in light of social complexity.  This research project employs ants as an ideal model system to analyze the relationship between sociality and brain evolution because different species form colonies that vary in size and the degree of complexity.  This research will also help us understand how exceptionally small brains are able to process complex social information.  The project will analyze differences in the size and organization of worker brains, and their metabolic costs to determine if complex social life has increased the efficiency of energy use in the brain.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate who will become skilled in designing scientific studies and will acquire techniques that enable brains to be imaged.  Students will also learn data analysis, and scientific writing and publication. The researchers will develop a curriculum to enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to the study of behavior and neuroscience.  The researchers will recruit diverse participants from the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago to encourage minority students to become activity engaged in science. The project will broadly support science outreach in the Chicago STEM Pipeline, Arizona Assurance, Brain Awareness, and Boston Upward Bound programs to address the critical national need to improve science education and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>To determine how social complexity has influenced brain evolution, the researchers will quantify neuronal metabolic requirements, neuropil investment and scaling, behavioral plasticity, and synaptic organization in brain regions considered key to cognitive function.  Pairs of species representative of major ant subfamilies that accentuate variability in social complexity will form the sample groups.  The researchers will: 1) quantify energetic requirements of functionally specialized neuropil using cytochrome oxidase staining to assess ATP use; 2) determine if brain development is experience-dependent; 3) quantify synaptic complexes associated with cognition; and 4) couple behavioral performance with neural and metabolic metrics.  The researchers will determine neuron number and size and variation in peripheral sensory structures, and examine brain compartment scaling patterns.  Controlling for phylogeny, analyses infer how independent evolutionary events associated with collective intelligence shaped brain evolution. All original images will be freely available upon publication, in the absence of copyright issues.  Organismal data (specimen and colony collection data, phenotypic data, etc.) will be maintained in individual labs, and will be made freely available upon request.

The ever-growing volume and complexity of these data sets make many traditional techniques inadequate to extract knowledge from them. An emerging area, known as sparse learning, has achieved great success in learning from big data by identifying a small set of explanatory features and/or samples. Typical examples include selecting features that are most indicative of users? preferences for recommendation systems, identifying brain regions that are predictive of neurological disorders based on imaging data, and extracting semantic information from raw images for object recognition. However, training sparse learning models can be computationally prohibitive due to the sparsity-inducing regularization, which is non-smooth and can be highly complex when incorporating complex structures. This project aims at developing algorithms and tools to significantly accelerate the training process of sparse learning models for big data applications. The key idea is to efficiently identify redundant features and/or samples, which can be removed from the training phase without losing useful information of interests. Success in these unique techniques is expected to dramatically scaling up sparse learning for big data by orders of magnitude in terms of both time and space. The PIs plan to integrate the big data reduction tools developed in this project into their education and outreach activities, including development of new courses and integration of project components into existing courses. The PIs will make special efforts to recruit female and underrepresented students to this project.<br/><br/>The major technical innovations of this project include the following components: (1) the PIs will develop efficient feature reduction methods for the generic scenario where the structures of both input and output can be represented by directed acyclic graphs; the proposed formulations include many existing approaches as special cases; (2) the PIs will develop efficient methods to reduce the numbers of features and samples simultaneously under a unified formulation, which can also incorporate various structures; (3) the PIs will develop efficient methods to discard irrelevant data subspaces to accelerate the process of uncovering low-rank structures commonly seen in big data. All the proposed data reduction methods are exact, i.e., the models learned on the reduced data sets are identical to the ones learned on the full data sets. This project heavily relies on optimization theory, especially on sensitivity analysis and convex geometry. The outcome of this project includes a unified approach to accelerate sparse learning and provide a systematic framework for developing efficient and exact data reduction methods. The systematic study and in-depth exploration of redundant data identification is expected to deepen the understanding of sparse learning techniques and dramatically enhance their applications in big data analytics."

The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.<br/><br/>The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions.

Advances in HPC are vital to national interests by providing infrastructure for scientific discovery that improves the national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense. To solve large-scale scientific problems, HPC relies on an increasing number of nodes and components, which makes it likelier for long-running computation to be interrupted with failures before completing. A critical technique to ensure computation completion is checkpointing. Checkpointing allows snapshots of the computation to be saved so that when a failure occurs, computation state can be restored from the last snapshot and continues execution, rather than restarting from the beginning. The research in this project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art checkpointing technique by making it significantly faster and lowering its cost. This project also plans to contribute to the training of future workforce by providing students with exposure to the mechanisms and inefficiencies of current checkpointing mechanisms on NVMM, and the new in-place checkpointing. The project seeks to increase participation of minority and under-represented groups and involves undergraduates in research.<br/><br/>Prior approaches to checkpointing rely on taking a snapshot of the system state (system-level checkpointing) or the application state (application-level checkpointing) and saving it to secondary non-volatile storage. With the advent of non-volatile main memory (NVMM), a new approach to checkpointing becomes possible.  In contrast to traditional approaches to checkpointing that rely on storing separate snapshots in a separate secondary storage, the project uses a new approach where checkpoints can be constructed in-place in the NVMM  utilizing the working data structures used by the applications. This allows only very minimal additional state beyond what the program already saves to memory, making checkpointing significantly faster and incurring lower cost, in turn providing further HPC scaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The earth is not shrinking, it is digitizing, and the ability for US researchers to stay competitive in the global research community will increasingly be determined by their ability to reduce the time from theory to discovery.  Over the last 5 years, the open source commercial sector has greatly outpaced the academic research world in its growth and adoption of programming languages, infrastructure design, and interface development. Problems that were primarily academic in nature several years ago are now common in the commercial world. Terms like big data, business intelligence, remote visualization, and streaming event processing, have moved from the classroom to the board room.  However, academic projects are largely unable to take advantage of many today's most popular and widely used open source technologies within the context of their campus and shared research infrastructure. The recently completed, NSF funded, Science Gateway Institute planning project revealed just how far behind many communities are. In a survey of over 26,000 NSF-funded PIs, science gateway developers, and leaders in higher education (i.e., CIOs, CTOs, and others), over 85% of respondents said they needed help adapting existing technologies to realize the needs of their gateway. Another 80% said they needed help simply understanding what technologies were available to them. The research community doesn't just see the gap, they live it. This project seeks to quickly close the capability gap between academic and commercial infrastructure by extending and making robust the Agave Platform, an open, Science-as-a-Service cloud platform for reproducible science. Essentially, this project will allow scientists to focus their energies on their science rather than so much on the computing technologies they use. <br/><br/><br/>This Agave Platform will build upon the success of the existing Agave Developer APIs which currently serve over 20,000 users in the plant biology community. This project includes three well-defined efforts which will synergistically evolve the current technology into a sustainable Science-as-a-Service platform for the national research community. First,it will extend the Agave Developer APIs with additional services and management interfaces to create a cohesive, self-provisioning Agave Platform which will enable Science-as-a-Service to the developer community. Second, the project team will partner with commercial and academic institutions to create a community driven Application Exchange (AX) based on Docker container technology to facilitate application transparency, portability, attribution, and reproducibility. Third, the project will consolidate existing open source contributions from projects already with the Agave ecosystem into Agave ToGo, a collection of reference science gateways in multiple languages and web frameworks. The Agave Platform will democratize access to software and infrastructure across all areas of science and engineering by modernizing the mechanisms with which the research community can utilize and access academic research infrastructure. This will bridge the gap between industrial and academic research infrastructure and allow researchers to use a new generation of open source software and technologies. The AX will enable greater interoperability and accountability in the way computational science results are published and reviewed. Through the matching investment of industrial partners, reproducibility, best practices, and rigorous scientific review will be brought to the mainstream and promoted as a fundamental aspect of the scientific process in an open, sustainable way. Agave ToGo will make custom gateways readily available to end users and developers alike. For end users, it will empower them to focus on domain science rather than computer science. For developers, it will stimulate innovation and increase the opportunity for discovery. When combined with the Agave Platform and Application Exchange, Agave ToGo will enable novice users to create scalable, reproducible, digital labs that span their office, commercial cloud, and national data centers in a matter of minutes."

This research project addresses key scientific and engineering barriers that currently prevent the production of additively manufactured products at an industrially-relevant scale. In particular, the project focuses on how to better design products that will be produced via additive manufacturing by considering manufacturing constraints and challenges associated with assembling parts into final products. The study will result in fast algorithms for generating and selecting design concepts that have the minimum number of parts required to cover all functional requirements and that meet constraints imposed by the additive manufacturing process. This will facilitate high-volume, mass production of 3D printed products, thereby furthering the practicality and economic impact of additive manufacturing. The project spans several disciplines through a joint effort between the University at Buffalo (UB) and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The project will enhance the curriculum related to design for additive manufacturing at the two participating universities by introducing results from this research into existing courses. Outreach activities will promote the recruitment of women and minorities to advanced manufacturing through workshops aimed at K-12 students organized in partnership with the Tech-Savvy program at UB. The research community will be engaged through a road-mapping workshop on computationally efficient methods in decision-based design. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to define a prescribed theoretical framework and practical methods for classifying and generating physically integrated design concepts that can be realized effectively through additive manufacturing. The framework is based on the independence of functional requirements principle and modeling of physical integration problems as graph coloring problems. The research will result in new, computationally efficient (polynomial-time) graph-coloring algorithms based on discharging techniques in combination with Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. The new algorithms and design framework will be demonstrated and evaluated on representative design problems with the resulting designs being realized through additive manufacturing. Manufacturing productivity measures such as surface roughness, buildup time and cost, will be considered."

The project incorporates fundamental research in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to further develop a multiscale generalized correlation framework to enable discovery and decision-making via analysis of large and complex data. The tools under development will allow scientists to better explore and understand high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multi-modal data in a myriad of applications. The project aims to provide a unified framework for discovery of relationships between observations in an efficient and theoretically-sound manner. <br/><br/>Combining the notion of generalized correlation with the locality principle, multiscale generalized correlation (MGC) is a superior correlation measure that equals the optimal local correlation among all possible local scales. By building upon distance correlation and making use of nearest neighbors, the resulting MGC test statistic is a unique dependence measure that is consistent for testing against all dependencies with finite second moment, and it exhibits better performance than existing state-of-art methods under a wide variety of nonlinear and high-dimensional dependencies. By investigating the theoretical aspects of distance-based correlations, this project aims to further improve the finite-sample performance of MGC-style tests, extend its capability to testing dependence on network and kernel data, and broaden its utility to general inferential questions beyond dependence testing such as two-sample testing, outlier detection, and feature screening, as well as applications to brain activity, networks, and text analysis. Overall, this project intends to establish a unified methodology framework for statistical testing in high-dimensional, noisy, big data, through theoretical advancements, comprehensive simulations, and real data experiments."

Macrosystem management requires an understanding of how different levels of spatial complexity (within a stream reach to entire river valley scales) and biotic organization (populations to ecosystems) affect the functioning of rivers and lakes. The present study will provide this information for 18 rivers spread equally between the two largest temperate steppe biomes of the world: the North American Great Plains and the Euro-Asian Steppes (including those in Mongolia). This project will provide research experiences for under-represented participants (particularly rural and Native American students), stimulate STEM program recruitment in largely under-represented (EPSCoR) states, support some faculty and students at primarily undergraduate institutions, and contribute to scientific education at both graduate and undergraduate institutions in two countries.<br/><br/>These rivers flow through 3 major types of ecoregions within these temperate steppe biomes: mountain steppe shrublands, short-to-tall grasslands, and semi-arid shrublands. Scientists and students from the USA and Mongolia will sample the structure and functioning of these 18 rivers in a variety of hydrogeomorphic areas, such as constricted, meandering, braided, and anastomosing channel sections. Despite their similarity in biome and ecoregional types, the river macrosystems of the Great Plains and the Mongolian steppes vary substantially in fauna, flora, and community through ecosystem functioning. These variations result from differences in climatic patterns, the degree of riverine landscape modification (e.g., by dams, levees, and riparian modification), and the naturalness of the resident fauna. For example, most rivers in the USA contain some dams and many exotic fauna have been introduced, while the vast majority of Mongolian rivers contain no dams and their aquatic fauna is almost exclusively natural and different from those in the USA. Moreover, the Central Asian subcontinental area of Mongolia has one of the strongest warming signals on earth, with air temperatures rising three times faster than the overall northern hemisphere average. Consequently, riverine macrosystems in the USA can help predict changes to Mongolian rivers as a result of pending dam construction and possible species introductions to some rivers, while knowledge of responses of Mongolian macrosystems to more rapid climatic changes can help predict future effects in U.S. rivers. Therefore, this project's goals are to: (a) compare and contrast hierarchical scaling relationships and effects of system drivers and cross-scale interactions on rivers in similar biomes and ecoregions of the two continents; and (b) evaluate effects of climatic changes and anthropogenic disturbance to these river macrosystems."

However, relying solely on the sensations that result from movement would be insufficient to quickly adjust and update future motor plans due to the inherent delays in the communication and processing within the central nervous system. There is strong behavioral evidence that to ensure sufficient control the brain uses information about the issued motor commands to form a prediction of the expected sensations that result from body motion. Despite this evidence, it remains largely unknown how the brain combines these predictions of sensory feedback with actual motion-induced sensations for movement control and self-movement perception. This CAREER proposal, through student involvement and outreach activities, lays the foundation for a long-term research and educational career to address these gaps in knowledge. Utilizing a diverse set of techniques, the investigator will systematically examine the contributions of actual and predicted sensory feedback to upper limb behavior.<br/><br/>Corollary discharge (CD, also referred to as efference copy) is the internal duplicate of a motor command made at the same time the motor signal is generated. This signal is used to predict the future state of the body and the expected sensory consequences due to movement. The integration of this internal state information with delayed sensory signals is critical for accurate movement control and motion perception. However, little is known about the properties of this signal in humans or how this internal movement information is integrated with reafferent sensory feedback. Despite being poorly understood, internal state estimation remains a critical feature of computational models of limb movement and feedforward control. To directly address the current gaps in knowledge, the proposed studies aim to (1) quantify the accuracy and sensitivity of proprioception and internal limb state estimation, (2) computationally describe how these signals are combined to aid perception and motor coordination, and (3) determine the causal relationships between behavior and the neural processing of these signals through the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation to areas within the parietal cortex and cerebellum. Pursuing the project goals will utilize different techniques (computational modeling, noninvasive neural stimulation and quantitative behavioral analysis) in order to advance the computational frameworks for sensorimotor integration and control. Increasing the understanding of this neural integration could potentially (1) provide the foundation for understanding how actual and predicted sensory information contribute to complex behaviors (e.g., eye-hand and bimanual coordination), (2) help define the constraints (e.g., timing and acuity) of the different sensory information required for effective neural prostheses and brain?machine interface control and (3) assist in distinguishing the basis of feedforward motor control deficits in several neurological diseases. Importantly, the project promotes the inclusion and training of students from various backgrounds, particularly minority students, and encourages the outreach and dissemination of the scientific research to a broad spectrum of participants within the community, from grade school students to retired individuals."

Gaining understanding of these dynamically evolving behavioral patterns is very important to solve problems associated with such systems. For example, in transportation networks, these emergent patterns usually dictate congestion dynamics and are poised to undergo a transformative change with the introduction of connected vehicles that can communicate with each other. Consequently, our ability to observe such patterns plays a critical role in effectively managing the transition to a smarter transportation network as well as in improving system performance and reducing congestion costs. This research seeks to answer questions about the appropriate scale at which these patterns may be best observed. Additionally, this work also seeks to assess the effect of varying penetration rates of connected vehicles on the ability to observe emergent patterns in traffic. This work has a great potential to significantly improve our ability to monitor, predict and control the occurrence of emergent congestion events. In the case of traffic flow applications, this study could help reduce worldwide congestion costs that are estimated to be in several hundreds of billions of US dollars annually. The techniques developed during this study will enhance our fundamental knowledge about how to observe the emergent behavior and use this knowledge to analyze and solve the problems associated with several other complex systems. The project also has highly innovative educational plan of creating visually appealing and lucid graphics material to engage undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the general public.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research project is to create a rigorous methodology to determine the spatial scale and model order required to observe and predict emergent phenomena in complex systems. In a narrower context of traffic flow, the project seeks to establish the modeling requirements for observing emergent congestion events on a multi-lane highway, and predicting such behavior with better accuracy than current prediction models. The approach will modify existing Krylov subspace-based model order reduction techniques by explicitly incorporating spatial scales into the process. More importantly, the novel contribution of this work will be the control-theoretic formulation of the renormalization group theory borrowed from the field of statistical mechanics to gain an understanding of how the observability of emergent dynamics depends on spatial scale. The research will include the study of spatial dependence of observability in complex systems in a control-theoretic setting. This work will also contribute to the study of how penetration rate (i.e., the distribution of a sensor network in a complex system) impacts the observability of emergent behavior in complex traffic flow dynamics."

Globally, an estimated 422 million people had diabetes. In the United States, about 8.3% of the population currently has diabetes and that number is projected to grow to 1 in 3 adults by 2050. The current treatment for high blood sugar is frequent self-administration of insulin injections and monitoring of blood sugar levels throughout the day is necessary to sustain life for patients with type 1 or advanced type 2 diabetes. Lack of tight control of blood sugar levels accounts for many chronic complications of diabetes, such as limb amputation, blindness and kidney failure; while low blood sugar levels result in life disruption and the risk of seizures, unconsciousness, brain damage, or possible death. Current insulin infusion approaches, however, cannot mimic normal physiological conditions in which the pancreatic cells quickly releases insulin in response to increase in blood sugar levels, and insulin levels are shut down once the blood sugar is normal. This proposal is to develop the next-generation blood glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems that are based on synthetic vesicles in a biomimetic manner, inspired by the vesicles (or granules) of pancreatic celIs. The planned insulin delivery system will be able to automatically regulate insulin release continuously and repeatedly according to blood sugar levels. Towards this goal, the PI proposes to develop transformative glucose-responsive insulin nanoparticles (GRINs) for intelligently regulating blood sugar levels with fast and repeatable responsiveness. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be triggered at a high blood sugar level, and the release is inhibited with a normal blood sugar range, thereby mimicking pancreatic cells to ""secrete"" insulin in response to fluctuating blood sugar levels. The GRINs prepared will be further loaded into a painless microneedle array-based patch on the skin to achieve easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will develop novel materials, formulations and devices that may be of broad use for development of other bio-responsive smart drug delivery systems. In addition, the proposed research will create dynamic and sustainable education activities, including a K-12 based outreach module 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', an interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, together with hands-on lab research. Such activities are expected to inspire students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>Technical: <br/>Diabetes is a major public health problem currently affecting about 422 million people across the world, and this number is expected to reach over 450 million by 2030. Current treatment for Type 1 and advanced Type 2 diabetic patients requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose (BG) levels and periodical insulin injections to maintain normal blood glucose levels. An artificial pancreas-like closed-loop insulin delivery system that continuously and intelligently releases insulin in response to changing blood glucose levels holds great promise for enhancing heath and improving quality of life for patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. To date, mimicking the function of pancreatic cells, chemically-controlled closed-loop delivery strategy utilizing synthetic materials and/or modified insulin have been widely explored. This typically consisted of polymeric formulations that swell, shrink or dissociate to adjust the insulin release rate according to ambient glucose levels. However, challenges remain to demonstrate a system which would combine; i) fast response; ii) repeatable activation; iii) ease of administration; and iv) excellent biocompatibility. The proposed project aims to develop the next-generation glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems, inspired by the ""natural"" granules of pancreatic cells. The PI will explore 'artificial' glucose-responsive insulin nano-granules (GRINs) and their relevant devices. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be rapidly triggered at high blood sugar state, and inhibited within a normal blood sugar levels in a repeatable manner. The GRINs developed will be further integrated into a painless microneedle array-based device for application on skin, and thus achieving easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will also guide the development of novel materials, formulations and devices for engineering other delivery systems which can be intelligently activated by the variation of physiological signals. Moreover, the proposed research program will be closely integrated with dynamic and sustainable educational activities, through development of a K-12 outreach module- 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', a new interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, as well as hands-on lab research. Students will be exposed to biomaterials, devices and micro-nanotechnology, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines."

How does influence propagate in social networks? How do the utilization of transportation options and the cost of ridership in a city change during the day and throughout the week? How does knowledge evolve? Formulating these questions as programs is currently beyond the skills of most data scientists. Executing such programs poses tremendous efficiency challenges, especially for graphs with billions of edges, and with non-trivial evolution rates.  Much research and engineering effort today goes into developing sophisticated graph analytics and their efficient implementations, both stand-alone and in scope of data processing platforms. Yet, systematic support for querying and analysis of evolving graphs is still lacking. This support is urgently needed, due both to the scalability challenges inherent in evolving graph analysis, and to considerations of usability and ease of dissemination. This project will fill this gap by establishing the fundamental principles of effective modeling and efficient analysis of evolving graphs, and by making results available to the community of use in an open-source platform called Portal.<br/><br/>This project will build on the state of the art in temporal data management, making the principles and techniques that were developed over decades of research and practice in that domain available to evolving graph applications.

Hurricane Harvey has provided the opportunity to precisely test how populations respond to extreme weather. This study specifically looks at how individuals of a common ant species who are repopulating decimated areas behave. Because recent climate models predict severe storms will become more common, understanding how these events affect the populations of native species exposed to them will become increasingly important to understanding the future trajectory of plant and animal survival and the population health of important species. This knowledge can be used to shape effective conservation and preservation strategies and to protect vulnerable species and habitat. This project leverages the existing interest the public has in how ants respond to flooding, such as fire ant rafting, to help explain how animals respond to extreme weather events. It also provides a foundation for hands-on activities and lesson plans to be distributed to rural Texas schools, including schools associated with citizens of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. Last, the researchers on this project have a strong commitment to recruiting underrepresented minorities to participate in this work.<br/><br/>The ability to disperse to and successfully colonize new habitats is predicated on a disperser's phenotypic and life history traits. In animal populations, patterns of space use and range expansion are inherently behavioral processes. As such, many animals exhibit distinct morphological and behavioral polymorphisms associated with dispersal and range expansion. However, few studies have focused on patterns of recolonization in populations' native ranges after local extinction events, despite the potential for long-term effects on population demography. This study leverages the unique circumstances created by Hurricane Harvey to ask whether re-colonizers of native, disturbed habitat bear behavioral traits predicted to promote colonization in new, non-native habitats.  Using ants of the genus Temnothorax, this study tracks the risk-tolerance and life-history phenotype of colonies recolonizing Big Thicket National Preserve in Eastern Texas after the local extinction event caused by Hurricane Harvey flooding. This is done by tracking the risk-tolerance of colonies re-establishing following floods with a standardized aggression assay. Additionally, colonies are kept in common garden conditions for one reproductive cycle to measure energetic allocation toward reproductive and somatic maintenance; a proxy for life-history strategy. This research provides significant insight into the role disturbance has in maintaining behavioral variation and thus a population's ability to recolonize after an extinction event."

How does one aggregate preferences of individuals, arriving at a society-wide consensus?  This question has been the subject of intense debate throughout history, dating as far back as ancient Greece, and, in the past two decades, has led to the development of computational social choice - an interdisciplinary area of research and practice that combines insights from mathematics, logic, economics, and computer science.  One of the main foci of computational social choice are the algorithmic aspects of determining actual or potential winners in a poll or in an election.  Moreover, dealing with incompleteness and uncertainty (an inherent characteristic of polling) is an important challenge confronted by computational social choice. In recent years, the data management community embarked on an investigation of preference databases, which extend traditional databases by treating preferences on a par with relational data.  This project will bring forth a foundational and systems research agenda that will create bridges between the computational social choice and the data management communities.  The main aim of this project is to develop a unifying framework that brings together preferences, rules, outcomes, contextual information, and database query languages.<br/><br/>This project will enrich the kinds of data analysis tasks that are currently supported by computational social choice methods to include context, going beyond determining winners, and into reasoning about positions and issues that the alternatives represent, as well as information about those choosing.  To this effect, this project will develop a query language that will enhance traditional database query languages with special operators for voting rules and winners, thus making it possible to study social choice problems in the context of additional information about voters, candidates, and issues. Furthermore, this language will support sophisticated queries about incomplete or uncertain preferences, rules, and winners in the relational context.  Rigorous semantics of queries in this language will be provided and fundamental algorithmic problems, such as query evaluation and reasoning about constraints, will be investigated.  The techniques developed in this project will be experimentally evaluated in a query engine prototype using real data sets. By establishing a technical connection between computational social choice and data management and by developing a unifying framework, the computational social choice community will have access to a plethora of methods for managing incomplete and uncertain information that were developed by the database community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their global importance, microbial responses to CTs are currently a mystery. This research project targets this substantial knowledge gap to identify the microorganisms and their enzymes that degrade CTs across a range of ecosystems. Beyond scientific advances, this project will also support significant curricular development in the introductory microbiology course at The Ohio State University. Through the development of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), this project will allow hundreds of undergraduate student-scientists to perform authentic research; experiences shown to enhance scientific education and boost retention of students in scientific disciplines. This project will create a modified undergraduate laboratory class where CURE students participate in the discovery and classification of CT degrading microorganisms new to science, generating data that will be integrated into the research aims of this project. Additionally, the scientific data generated here will be transmitted more broadly to the scientific community via the production of an interactive, web-based bioinformatics platform. As part of the integrated research and educational objectives, this research will generate fundamental knowledge of CT-microbe interactions with direct applications to agricultural, industrial, and health resource management. <br/><br/>Today the diversity of microorganisms, enzymes, and pathways mediating microbial CT degradation are currently unknown. The overarching goal of this research project is to test the central hypothesis that mechanisms for tolerance and degradation of CTs are widely encoded in microbial genomes across ecosystems, yet currently represent a cryptic microbial metabolism. This project tracks CT metabolism from organismal to ecosystem scales, identifying the enzymatic catalysts of organismal CT tolerance and degradation, the coordinated responses to CT perturbation in microbial communities, and the extent of CT metabolisms across ecosystems. Here, parallel isolate and community genomics paired to expression analyses and high-resolution CT metabolite data will elucidate the organisms, enzymes, and metabolisms mediating CT degradation and resistance. Outcomes from this research project include (1) knowledge of the microbial physiology and ecology of CTs, (2) discovery of novel degradative enzymes that are likely common to anaerobic microorganisms, (3) development of a CT library of biological and metabolite signatures resulting in the identification of microbial polyphenolics and their degradation products."

Nanofabrication has been widely implemented commercially for improving microelectronic devices and information technology. However, the limitations of conventional lithography techniques in terms of resolution, capital and operational costs, and limited flexibility in terms of materials that can be patterned and fabricated have motivated the development of unconventional fabrication methods. Scanning probe lithography is one of these promising new fabrication methods, and it uses a scanning sharp probe to produce with nanoscale precision modifications on the surface of a material. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a scanning probe lithography method based on hot probes, which are used to thermo-chemically change the properties of a material at the nanoscale. This technology, called thermochemical nanolithography, has a broad range of applications, in particular to fabricate nanostructures in graphene, conductive polymers nanowires, DNA and protein nano-arrays. The research work is geared toward answering questions that can facilitate the wide scale use of thermochemical nanolithography and providing students with a unique interdisciplinary training that includes developing knowledge in materials science, spectroscopy, nano- and micro-fabrication, and surface science techniques. This will enable the team to augment the community's understanding of nanoscale processes and potentially provide inexpensive and robust tools to decrease the cost of entry into nanolithographic patterning. <br/><br/>Thermochemical nanolithography is a versatile atomic force microscopy based technique that can be used to fabricate nanostructures and nanoribbons of graphene-like materials via local thermal reduction of chemically modified graphene. Thermochemical nanolithography uses thermal probes to locally heat the surface of a material to produce a variety of nano-scale chemical reactions, which can be controlled in terms of spatial resolution and extent of chemical conversion, so that complex chemical gradients can be obtained. For applications in the next generation of electronic, sensor and energy nano-devices based on graphene-like materials, this project aims to address the following issues: (i) fabrication of defect-free graphene nanoribbons with control over size, length and positioning (registry) on arbitrary substrates; and (ii) nanoscale control of the chemistry of graphene and other materials nanostructures. The research team will use experiments, finite elements calculations and density functional theory simulations for understanding and controlling the nanoscale thermo-chemical modification of graphene-based materials to fabricate graphene nanoribbons of high quality with excellent control over positioning and size. Furthermore, this project aims at developing parallel (up to 100 probes) patterning using novel concepts of temperature control and software, with the goal of writing and then reading more than 1 million 10-nm pixels in 1 second."

The first of these is the existence of a relatively light so-called Higgs boson, as discovered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012.   The biggest mystery here is to explain the origin of the mass of this new particle.   The second fundamental problem is to understand the nature and origin of the so-called ""dark matter"" that is five times more prevalent throughout the universe than ordinary matter. One possibility is that dark matter can arise together with a completely new sector of dark particles which have not been discovered by experiments conducted thus far because such particles are presumed to interact only very weakly with the known particles.  As part of her proposed research, Professor Gori will pursue an ambitious research program focused on studying these two fundamental problems at the interface between high-energy and high-intensity experiments. She will explore new models with more than one Higgs boson and investigate extended dark-sector theories.   As part of her work, she will also develop new search strategies for existing and planned experiments at Fermilab and extend its science mission with searches for dark particles.  As such, Professor Gori's research furthers the national interest by advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and potentially enhancing the research done at one of the premier US national laboratories. Professor Gori will also initiate an outreach program aimed at underrepresented minorities (URMs), connecting the University of Cincinnati Physics Department with local high schools and elementary schools whose student populations are majority female or African-American.  In particular, she will start a ""Women in STEM: From High School to Academia"" program, and she will broaden the after-school programs of local schools with predominantly URM student bodies. <br/> <br/>More technically, Professor Gori will build new models of extended sectors responsible for quark and lepton masses, and explore the signatures of such models at both low- and high-energy experiments, focusing on the connection between Higgs and flavor physics. Professor Gori will develop new search strategies for light dark sectors at existing and planned experiments at Fermilab: MINOS+, NOvA and the DUNE near detectors, and the SeaQuest nuclear physics experiment. This will allow searches for a vast set of dark-sector theories. Professor Gori will also work closely with the experimental collaborations to explore optimized setups for DUNE and SeaQuest to maximize their physics reach. Professor Gori will also exploit the connection between the Higgs and dark sectors in order to develop scenarios in which dark-sector particles are produced from Higgs decays, leading to novel signatures that can investigated over the coming years at the LHC."

A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. <br/><br/>The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive theory of computational pseudo-randomness in the setting of quantum information processing. These pseudo-random objects and tools can be useful in quantum algorithm design and quantum complexity theory. The computational approach of this project to some problems outside the conventional territory of computing could stimulate further collaboration between computer scientists, quantum information theorists and physicists.  Course development, assisting the development of local ``Women in CS'' chapter and ``Women in Tech'' events, establishing interest groups in quantum computing at the university to attract underrepresented students, as well as outreach to high school students are an integral part of this award.<br/><br/>This specific focus is on computational pseudorandomness, which is indistinguishable from true randomness as far as efficient observers are concerned. There are three major objectives: 1) formalize and design pseudorandom quantum states and quantum operators, in analogy to two basic classical pseudorandom objects -- pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions; 2) investigate their applications in computer science, especially in quantum cryptography such as constructing quantum money, quantum authentication, and a novel primitive of tokenized cryptography. This requires developing appropriate quantum security models and designing new schemes; 3) develop other quantum pseudorandom objects and explore applications beyond computer science such as understanding black holes and thermalization in physics. The proposed pseudorandom objects and techniques to be developed can provide more efficient solutions to some proposed applications or even overcome some no-go results in the information-theoretical setting. This study complements the work on quantum state and unitary designs, which are statistical approximations to the quantum Haar randomness. Together, they can reveal more insights to the fundamental properties of quantum information.

These patterns are called 'surface instabilities'. Over the past several years, there has been significant interest in understanding how surface instabilities form, as they are ubiquitous in biological systems and have found wide use in engineering applications ranging from microfabrication to soft robotics. However, nearly all of the past studies have focused on understanding how surface instabilities form under very slow compression, or have neglected the dynamics leading to this event. This award will investigate how surface instabilities form and propagate across the surface of the material as a result of fast compression or impacts. The speed of the event causing the instability is critical as it yields fundamentally unique phenomena, which are prevalent in most physical systems, but still not well understood. The improved understanding gained as part of this fundamental research will impact a broad range of applications. For example, because of the role of surface instabilities in friction, this research will positively affect engineering applications with moving soft materials in contact. It will also lead to improved understanding of the dynamics of sandwich beam composites, and to improved impact absorbers, shock protective systems, and novel soft electronics devices. In addition to the research goals, this project has a significant education and outreach component that will positively affect students from K-12 through graduate levels, and will increase the involvement of underrepresented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The research objective of this multidisciplinary, collaborative project is to investigate the initiation and propagation of surface instabilities in soft materials under dynamic loading, using a combined theoretical, computational, and experimental approach. Experimental characterization will be conducted using a combination of drop tower, high-speed video, and laser ultrasonic test methods. Dynamic surface instability propagation will be modeled analytically, and computationally using nonlinear finite element techniques. This project will provide significant intellectual contribution by answering open questions including: What are the conditions for initiating the propagation of surface instabilities, and how do they propagate? How does the propagation of surface instabilities lead to material failure? And how can the propagation of surface instabilities be manipulated? More generally, as there have been almost no investigations into the dynamics of propagating surface instabilities, this investigation will open a new class of instability-based surface waves and provide an improved understanding of dynamic phenomena in soft materials."

Subduction zones are where two tectonic plates collide and one sinks below the other.  Subduction zones produce the largest earthquakes in the world, such as the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 2011 that caused widespread destruction in northern Japan.  This project will focus on two subduction zone regions: Cascadia in the U.S. and Hikurangi in New Zealand. Onshore and offshore GPS data will be modeled to determine the amount of slip released as slow slip events, as steady creep, or where regions are locked and not slipping. Slow slip events refer to slip on a fault that is similar to what occurs during an earthquake, but occurs much more slowly and does not emit damaging seismic waves. Locked regions refer to areas of a fault in which friction prevents slip, allowing energy to build up for future release in an earthquake. In contrast to previous modeling work, this project will use realistic, three-dimensional elastic properties of the earth constrained by prior seismic studies. The products of this project will directly inform earthquake hazard forecasts for both the Cascadia and Hikurangi subduction zones, which have major cities nearby (Portland and Seattle in Cascadia; Wellington in Hikurangi). Important additional information will be obtained for an International Ocean Discovery Program project scheduled for the northern Hikurangi margin in 2018 that is targeting the slow slip region. The project will support and train an early career female scientist who will be mentored by a more established female scientist.  The project also features public outreach through public talks in New Zealand and the U.S. and the incorporation of the results into lecture materials at two universities in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project will generate new and improved catalogs of slow slip events and plate locking models for the Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction zones. A Network Inversion Filter (NIF) technique will be used to process all available GPS data to identify slow slip events, and produce models of slip and slip-rate evolution over time.  The NIF technique is based on a Kalman filter approach, which balances a physically reasonable but inaccurate model of steady slip with noisy data.  Additionally, these NIF inversions will incorporate offshore ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip deployment during the mid-2014 to mid-2015 time period for the Hikurangi subduction zone.  These OBP instruments recorded a large offshore slow slip event in late 2014. These models include, for the first time, realistic, three-dimensional earth structure and the effects topography and bathymetry.  Long-term velocities of GPS stations will be modeled to obtain improved constraints on the plate interface locking region for each subduction zone. Plate locking indicates how much of the expected motion between tectonic plates is not occurring continuously at the boundary, and could therefore be released in earthquakes or slow slip events. GPS station velocities will be averaged in two ways: first only over times between slow slip events and second by averaging through slow slip events which will provide two locking models for each subduction zone.  Products will include new realistic 3D locking models for the two regions, slow-slip event catalogs for both subduction zones and a full-slip budget with uncertainties for each subduction zone as a function of location over the time period of study."

Efforts of many research laboratories are focused on creation of scientific codes for data generation, analysis and interpretation. However, publicly funded and often hard won scientific codes developed in a typical research laboratory too frequently become unsustainable  beyond the lifetime of funding or shortly after staff rotation. Projects that are funded to afford expensive computer science expertise simply to maintain and update existing software divert scarce resources from the lab's primary goals and often translates the problem without resolving it.  Only a select number of researchers receive sufficient funding to maintain and update software, limiting the dissemination of new ideas and techniques. The diversity and continually changing nature of software environments compounds the issues.  Enabling user utilization presents hurdles in deployment, access and training.  These issues also create barriers to the implementation of new ideas embodied in new codes.  The GenApp project's goals are to address these issues. To begin with, GenApp enables the rapid dissemination of scientific codes to researchers with minimal software expertise. As more researchers use these codes, more of them become vested in the codes, which helps their sustainability. <br/><br/>The fundamental goal of this project is to advance the GenApp framework into a transformative tool to broadly benefit the scientific software developer community. GenApp is a generalized application generation framework intended for rapid deployment of scientific codes, which can generate both science gateways and stand-alone applications. Among the main unique features of GenApp are the minimal technical expertise requirement for the end user and an open-end design ensuring sustainability of generated applications. To produce fully functional applications, GenApp weaves libraries of fragments and user defined modules as directed by simple definition files, created from a uniform, logical, and simple-to-encode general interface definition file provided by GenApp.  This general definition file and the underlying software can be reused indefinitely to produce applications in a variety of existing and yet-to-be defined software environments. Preserving such simplicity with GenApp's maturation is one of the main developmental strategies. To achieve the goal of GenApp four focus Aims have been proposed. The first is infrastructure development, which includes general enhancements to the capabilities of GenApp. The second is documentation, training, dissemination, outreach and sustainability - all important aspects to produce a software product that is useful to the community. The third is simply feedback, since user and developer feedback will help drive the first two Aims.  The final Aim includes two structural biology domain science applications that will adopt and drive GenApp development.  GenApp will see its primary practical utilization in making highly demanding novel computational and analysis tools accessible to experimentalists and theoreticians working in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle scattering (SAS) domains of structural biology.

Despite its importance, understanding of how meltwater moves and is stored within snow before it gets to streams and rivers is limited to knowledge gained from a few small-scale snow studies. There are pressing needs to better understand how these dynamics affect streamflow. Seasonal snow-cover is one of the fastest changing water resources under current climate trends with important yet uncertain implications on runoff production. While the concept of hydrologic connection between soils and streams has received attention, the liquid water storage and connectivity of flowpaths within a mountain snowpack at slope scales relevant to runoff generation are less understood. This is a major gap in knowledge of mountain streamflow production. Emerging capabilities in remote sensing technology, ground-based observations, and physically-based hydrologic modeling provide new opportunity to better understand snow water resources in headwater catchments. Specifically, improved understanding of the distribution of liquid water in a snowpack will transform the scientific community?s ability to monitor and predict the physical hydrological processes that occur during snowmelt. This project leverages state-of-the-science observation and numerical modeling techniques to understand the storage and transport of liquid water within a seasonal snowpack. Using newly developed in-snow liquid water mapping techniques, together with airborne-based snow depth mapping, we will track the storage and movement of meltwater across sloping terrain of a heavily monitored alpine watershed. A flexible hydrologic model will be used to assess our ability to simulate the observed processes. Results will improve scientific capabilities to: a) conceptualize and model snowmelt processes, b) understand the importance of the hydraulic properties of snow at the catchment scale, and c) constrain the potential hydrologic impacts of climate and land-cover change. In broader impacts, thos project will help students to understand fundamental concepts of hydrology and understand the various methods of study of hydrology such as modeling, field observations and remote sensing. The project will support one graduate and two undergraduate students who will be involved in numerical modeling and field work. The project will be carried out at the University of Colorado and Mountain research Stations. The project will in many diverse group of students who are first generation college students, students of color, veterans and rural students.<br/><br/><br/>	The goal of this project is to characterize and constrain the physical mechanisms that control snowmelt delivery to streams in headwater basins. This project leverages new observation and modeling techniques to quantify and simulate the snow distribution, snowpack water holding capacity, snowmelt production, and dynamic in-snow flowpaths. This is achieved through state-of-the-science techniques including ground penetrating radar (GPR), instrumented unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), global positioning system (GPS) instrumentation, and a network of automated sensor nodes to intensively monitor soil moisture and snow depth, and a weir to monitor streamflow. Finally, hydrologic modeling will be conducted with the Structure for Unified Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) model to assess the impact of modeling decisions and the ability to simulate snowmelt dynamics. The overarching research question of this project is: How do snowpack liquid water storage and through-snow hydrologic flowpaths affect hillslope-stream connectivity, and how do these processes evolve through the snowmelt season? This work will observe and simulate the spatially and temporally variable snowmelt season to complete the following project objectives: 1) Map the seasonal dynamics of catchment snow water equivalent (SWE) using UAV flights, GPR surveys, a network of sensor nodes, and manual observations. 2) Monitor the spatial and temporal progression of snowpack liquid water content and transport using combined UAV and GPR surveys, automated GPS signal attenuation, soil moisture sensors, and catchment streamflow response. 3)	Evaluate the skill of hydrologic models to simulate the observed dynamics of the snowpack, soil, and streamflow response by systematically analyzing multiple model representations of hydrologic processes and scaling behavior. This research question will be investigated in a snow-dominated headwater catchment in the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado. Our work builds upon decades of local research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecological processes. The Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado Boulder benefits from partnerships with the strong local scientific communities including LTER and CZO research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will bring together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and science teachers to identify a set of practices that science teachers can readily incorporate into their planning and instruction.  The project will design, develop, and test a research-based professional learning approach to help middle school science teachers effectively support and sustain student motivational competencies during science instruction.  The approach will include use of materials addressing student motivational processes and how to support them, evaluation tools to measure student motivational competencies, lesson planning tools, and instruments for teacher self-evaluation. The translation to practice will include recognition of student diversity and consider ways to facilitate context-specific integration of disciplinary and motivational knowledge in practice. The project will focus on middle school science classrooms because this period is an important motivational bridge between elementary and secondary science learning. This project will enhance understanding of teacher pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in that it frames knowledge about supporting motivational competencies in science as PCK rather than general pedagogical knowledge. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.   <br/><br/>This early stage design and development project will iteratively develop and study a model of teacher professional learning that will help middle school science teachers create, modify, and implement instruction that integrates support for students' motivational competencies with the science practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas specified in science curriculum standards.  A design-based research approach will be used to develop and test four resources teachers will use to explicitly include attention to student motivational competencies in their lesson planning efforts.  The resources will include: 1) educational materials about students' motivational processes with concrete examples of how to support them; 2) easy-to-implement student evaluation tools for teachers to gauge students' motivational competencies; 3) planning tools to incorporate motivational practices into science lesson planning; and 4) instruments for teacher self-evaluation. A collaborative group of educational researchers will partner with science teachers from multiple school districts having diverse student populations to jointly develop the professional learning approach and resources. This project will contribute to systemic change by moving motivational processes from an implicit element of educating students, to an explicit and intentional set of strategies teachers can enact.  Research questions will focus on how teachers respond to the newly developed professional learning model, and how students respond to instruction developed through implementing the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While enhancing user privacy, the Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) makes it difficult for middleboxes that are commonly used by Internet service providers and mobile carriers to operate, because numerous beneficial middlebox functions (e.g., caching, web page optimization) rely on accessing the unencrypted traffic content. To overcome this challenge, this project develops a system aiming for a practical, ready-to-deploy solution that allows middleboxes to selectively inspect and manipulate HTTPS traffic while still respect the privacy requirements of users. This research will lead to new and continuous innovations in network services that are hard or impossible to achieve today. <br/><br/>The system has two prominent features. First, it is only deployed at client hosts as an operating system (OS) service, as well as on middleboxes. In addition to being transparent to applications, it does not change the encryption protocol or anything on the server side. Therefore, the system can be easily deployed by, for example, regular OS update pushed by mobile carriers. Second, the system allows clients to control what information the middlebox can access. Doing so provides least privileges to middleboxes for performing their functions. In addition, the proposed system is easy to use, secure, and incurs low overhead.<br/><br/>Developing these technologies will facilitate our understanding of the possible design space to allow coordinated, secure, and efficient manipulation of HTTPS traffic, ultimately leading to improved Internet user experience and privacy.

The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. <br/><br/>It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project.

Such technologies have started to unleash a transformation of Web search from a keyword match to discovery, learning, and creativity, which are crucial to promoting the goal of knowledge discovery. Unfortunately, the search for information remains inherently difficult for significant portions of the Web such as the Scholarly Web, which contains many millions of scientific documents. For example, PubMed has over 20 million documents, whereas Google Scholar is estimated to have more than 100 million. Open-access digital libraries such as CiteSeerX, which acquire freely-available research articles from the Web, witness an increase in their document collections as well. Despite attractive advancements by scholarly search portals, semantic search technologies that ""understand"" complex concepts and their relations and can systematically satisfy users' intricate information needs have yet to be investigated on the Scholarly Web. The goal of this project is to design solutions to make information more accessible and comprehensible to Scholarly Web users in particular, and Web users in general, and to help them discover knowledge more effectively and efficiently. The approach taken will be to develop an integrated framework, focusing on the extraction and utilization of scholarly knowledge graphs in online scholarly environments. Educationally, this work will involve: training of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, particularly encouraging the participation of women and underrepresented groups in the research efforts; curriculum development and integration of research into courses taught by the PI; exposure of students to industry and international experiences; and education for the general public.<br/> <br/>The project will target the following research objectives: (1) explore the construction of scholarly knowledge graphs that combine evidence from multiple resources in an open information extraction framework; (2) design and develop novel algorithms for the detection and analysis of interesting and previously unknown connections between concepts, in order to enforce knowledge discovery on the Scholarly Web; and (3) investigate the utility of scholarly knowledge graphs in a question answering system.

This research will study how, when, and where people use smartphones and the relationship between these usage patterns and the likelihood of being a victim of cybercrime. This research is the first step to a better scientific understanding how the physical world surrounding smartphone use enables cybercrime. Tired users may be less cautious in browsing to unsafe websites, or distracted users may miss a critical pop-up that a virus has been detected. Once these unsafe patterns of behavior are identified, new techniques, tools, and training can be developed to help prevent smartphone users from becoming victims of cybercrime.<br/><br/>This research expands existing theories of victimization in the domain of mobile devices, where both the criminal activity and the victimization occur online but may be affected by the offline environment. This research collects sensor data from the smartphones of 160 volunteers, such as GPS location, call frequency, and app usage. The smartphone sensor data is combined with questionnaires, demographic data from the U.S. Census, and neighborhood condition data from Google Street view.  This research also provides a baseline of smartphone security threats stemming from behavioral and social factors, and applies new methods for social science research using mobile sensor data to unobtrusively observe the daily activities of subjects. Finally, this research adds to the body of knowledge on the fundamental limitations of sensor-based activity and context inferences, provides a unique corpus of smartphone sensor data that is freely available to the scientific community, and a set of open source tools for collecting and analyzing the data."

However, students need guidance to be successful at giving help. This research explores how students give help to their peers as they move between learning activities. It also explores the development of personalized learning technologies to provide students with individualized support that improves their help-giving skills across activities. Traditional personalized learning technologies have been ""single-serving,"" in that they are built for a particular activity and do not leverage a student's other experiences with the domain. This single-serving approach misses the opportunity to gain a holistic perspective of a student's ability and adaptively track a student's growth in learning. This project will develop a new technology, called Ubiquitous Collaboration Support (UbiCoS), that can adaptively support the same student in giving help across different learning tools. UbiCoS is applied to peer help across three 8th grade mathematics activities. The first is a discussion forum integrated with a digital textbook where students answer questions posed by their classmates. The second is an online Q&A forum where students go to answer questions posted by other students around the world. The third is a teachable agent system where students explain mathematics concepts to a virtual agent. Enhanced understanding of how technology can facilitate help-giving interactions could improve how peer help activities are designed and supported in middle school mathematics classrooms, which would directly impact domain learning, help-giving skills, and motivation. This project explores ways to broaden interest in STEM by fostering help-giving discourse in middle school experiences. The proposal has the potential to directly impact over 300 students engaged in the evaluation and iterative development of UbiCoS and create digital tools that engage learners that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>This project designs and incorporates knowledge about the individual student's pattern of help-giving actions across activities into standard components of personalized collaboration support including automatic interpretation of student interaction, expert and student models, and a support module. UbiCoS will be iteratively developed and evaluated in three phases. The first engages students in workshops to aid in the design of the help-giving support. The second phase conducts design studies to improve understanding of the relationship between the timing and content of adaptive support, student help-giving behaviors, and cognitive and motivational processes. Finally, the third phase consists of a controlled study to evaluate the impact of the support on student outcomes. The results of these user studies will advance understanding of an instructional framework describing the ways adaptive help-giving support should account for cognitive, motivational, and classroom factors as they relate to a student's prior experiences. This research establishes UbiCoS as a new genre of educational technology that can support collaboration in a holistic manner, across different learning activities."

The proposed research is inspired by biological surfaces, like leaves, that exhibit different wetting behavior in their lifetime, and turn from hydrophobic to hydrophilic as natural or man-made pollutants interact with their surface. Investigating how the dynamics of drops splashing on leaves change because of changes on surface characteristics is important for understanding early catastrophic leaf loss and developing methods to avoid it. This can have further implications on predicting levels of food and forest resources.<br/><br/>Most of the previous work done by biologists and biochemists about shedding of leafs, has focused on acute chemical effects of air contaminants on leaf surfaces. Nevertheless, both the physical mechanism of a leaf turning hydrophilic and the dynamical aspects of hydrophilic leaves in response to raindrops are not well understood, which may significantly contribute to catastrophic leaf loss after rain. The PI proposes to investigate the interplay between a leaf?s wettability, elasticity, and drop spreading, inspired by a raindrop impacting a leaf in nature. First, the mechanism of transitioning from hydrophobic to hydrophilic leaves will be explored. Secondly, the spreading dynamics of a droplet on a curved substrate will be formulated both macroscopically and microscopically in terms of wettability and a falling speed, which will allow the estimation of an impact force and drop-spreading radius on the leaf. Finally, a leaf?s mechanical moduli and ultimate strengths will be characterized, in order to understand bending and torsional deformations of a leaf upon drop impact. The PI will pursue personal and educational interests for students with disabilities. As an educational objective, the PI will develop research programs that assist disabled students in overcoming the difficulties encountered in the current educational system, due to impaired social and communication skills. A proposed peer-buddy program is designed for students with autism or other social impairments by exposing them to laboratory research along with typical peers in structured environments. An inclusive environment would provide the students with structured research opportunities, which would help to develop the confidence and capacity needed to effectively communicate and collaborate with their peers, and eventually become future engineers or scientists."

Unlike existing techniques that seek only to improve position tracking along a path, this research project will focus on the iteration-to-iteration improvement of economic metrics such as energy generation/expenditure, total iteration time, or monetary cost. The control techniques created in this research will be applicable to a wide variety of systems for which repetitive control is essential and there exists a clear economic objective to improve upon from one iteration to the next. Example applications include assembly line and manufacturing operations (an over $1 trillion industry where parts are produced by the thousands and minimizing manufacturing time and energy expenditure is critical), actively-controlled exoskeletons (which control a repetitive human walking gait), and airborne wind energy systems. This research will focus specifically on airborne wind energy systems, which replace the conventional tower with tethers and a lifting body to harness high altitude winds using very little material. These systems can generate substantially increased energy through repetitive crosswind flight, rather than stationary operation, and there exists a significant opportunity to improve the energy generation performance from one repetition to the next. The research will be augmented by education and outreach activities, including the creation of wind energy-inspired undergraduate classroom modules, development of a kite design activity at the Charlotte Engineering Early College High School, and summer opportunities at a regional airborne wind energy company, Windlift, Inc.<br/><br/>This project will derive new control theoretic knowledge for a unique economic iterative learning control framework that focuses on maximizing or minimizing a profitability index rather than mere tracking performance. Specifically, the learning framework will blend two mechanisms that will transform the state of the art in point-to-point iterative learning control. First, unlike traditional point-to-point iterative learning control approaches where the waypoints are pre-specified and only the behavior between waypoints can be adapted from one iteration to the next, the framework will enable adaptation of the waypoints themselves from one iteration to the next. Secondly, an inner loop flexible-time iterative learning control module will allow the waypoint arrival times and total iteration time to vary from one iteration to the next. This will enable the research team to tackle time-optimal and energy-optimal problems through an iterative learning framework, which has not been accomplished in a general sense to-date. Considering that the waypoint adaptation law and flexible time iterative learning module comprise two interconnected subsystems, a small gain stability analysis framework will be used to derive bounds on the allowable variation of waypoints from one iteration to the next. Finally, the application of the ILC framework to repetitive crosswind flight of AWE systems will provide an online learning mechanism for the optimization of crosswind flight, which is especially important due to the complex and uncertain dynamic models of these systems (which can often render offline crosswind trajectory optimizations ineffective)."

Such applications include coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles that operate in variable atmospheric conditions, concepts for relocatable marine hydrokinetic energy systems that operate in a varying ocean environment, and airborne wind energy systems that operate in an atmospheric environment where the wind varies with respect to both time and vertical position. This research will focus on deriving general theory that will be relevant to a variety of applications, along with the validation of these results on an airborne wind energy system. In airborne wind energy systems, the conventional tower is replaced by tethers and a lifting body (a wing or aerostat) that elevates a horizontal-axis turbine to high altitudes. Because the tether lengths can be adjusted, the operating altitude can be varied to optimally harness the wind resource. The work will include a substantial complementary educational component, wherein graduate, undergraduate, and STEM high school students will utilize NREL's Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to optimize renewable/storage/dispatchable network configurations for microgrids in North Carolina and California.<br/><br/>This research will derive new control theoretic knowledge and tools for the systems that operate in a spatiotemporally varying and partially observable environment. While optimal control in a temporally varying environment is a well-studied problem that can be addressed through Markov models, the addition of a spatial component results in an explosion in the number of states, rendering Markov-based methods computationally infeasible in most cases. Furthermore, the presence of partial observability results in a fundamental tradeoff between exploration (obtaining knowledge of the spatial environment) and exploitation (operating at the most favorable locations). To address the complexities of this spatiotemporal optimization problem, this research will explore the use of a multi-rate, multi-scale hierarchical framework. Specifically, an upper-level controller will perform a global optimization over a very coarse grid (thereby rendering the optimization computationally tractable), and a lower-level optimization will perform adjustments on a much finer grid. The research will focus on model predictive control for the upper-level optimization and will explore the use of extremum seeking and model predictive control strategies at the lower level. Control algorithms will be validated on a model of a lighter-than-air airborne wind energy system, using real wind shear profile models and load demand data. In this airborne wind energy system, the wind speed is only measurable at the system?s operating altitude (thereby making the problem partially observable), and significant energy production improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude.<br/>uction improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude."

Airborne wind energy systems replace towers with tethers and a lifting body, reducing deployment time and fixed infrastructure costs, and enabling turbines to take advantage of strong, high-altitude winds. Successful realization of these systems is projected to yield levelized costs of electricity below $0.25 per kW-h, providing cost-competitive energy solutions to remote communities, islands, military bases, and deep-water offshore locations. The synthesis of control systems to stabilize airborne wind energy systems in harsh atmospheric conditions remains a bottleneck for their widespread acceptance, further exacerbated by high prototype development costs. This research will reduce control system prototyping costs by multiple orders of magnitude, using 1/100-scale models that are 3D printed, tethered, and ""flown"" in a water channel laboratory test facility. The water channel provides an ideal mechanism for optimizing the control system design while replicating key dynamic properties of the full-scale system. Throughout the project, students will develop an industrial and small-business perspective through interactions with a leading early-stage airborne wind energy company. Outreach activities include the development of kite design modules for a high school engineering summer camp and co-design of an energy-rich science curriculum for an early college high school for economically disadvantaged students.<br/><br/>Optimization of airborne wind energy flight performance represents a coupled plant and controller optimization problem, where experiments are indispensable but expensive at full-scale.

This water channel platform, which will be instrumented for closed-loop control of tethered systems, has been shown to yield provably similar dynamic performance to full-scale systems. In the proposed plant and controller optimization process, experimental data will be used to perform parameter identification and generate corrections to subsequent numerical optimization iterations. At the completion of each numerical optimization iteration, optimal design of experiments techniques will be used to determine a set of configurations to be tested, taking into account the cost of each reconfiguration.

When two or more parties share secret data, often there are certain actions they can perform to strengthen their information security.  For example, sometimes revealing partial information to an unwanted eavesdropper can actually improve the overall security.  This project seeks to develop a quantitative picture of how secrecy evolves as the trusted parties manipulate their data and publicly share part of their information with one another.  A novel approach to this problem will be adopted through the use of recently developed techniques in the study of quantum entanglement and the theory of entanglement transformations.  The notion of secrecy will be placed on the same fundamental level as quantum entanglement in that both will be viewed as precious physical resources that can be manipulated and used for various information processing tasks.  Investigating the connection between classical secrecy and quantum entanglement will not only offer a new level of unification between quantum mechanics and classical information theory, but it will also yield a fresh perspective on how quantum and classical physics differ.  Ultimately, the deeper understanding of classical secrecy developed in this project will lead to improved security analysis and new methodologies for securely transmitting information.<br/><br/>This research program investigates fundamental questions in quantum information theory and classical cryptography.  A typical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol (like those employed by commercial QKD machines) consists of two separate phases - called Alice and Bob - who use a quantum channel to exchange quantum information between them. However, in this process an eavesdropper - named Eve - may interact with their state so that all three systems are described by the joint quantum state &#961;ABE. Eventually the parties measure their respective systems and obtain measurement outcomes, i.e. classical data. But due to the indeterminism of quantum mechanics, this measurement data can only be described by some tripartite probability distribution PABE.  The second phase of the QKD protocol is purely classical and now consists of Alice and Bob using local operations and public communication to convert the distribution PABE into secret key states, which are perfectly correlated bits shared between Alice and Bob, yet completely hidden from Eve. This process is known as public key agreement, or secret key distillation.  Using secret key states, Alice and Bob will be able to transmit data secretly from Eve, regardless of her computational power.  The distribution PABE is said to possess ""secret correlations"" since using public key agreement, it can be converted into secret key states.    <br/><br/>Classical systems that share secret correlations behave remarkably similar to quantum systems that share entanglement.   In particular, both quantum entanglement and secret correlations are capable of being transformed, degraded, and enhanced through local physical processing and global classical communication.  In this project, a mathematical framework will be constructed that is suitable for studying the most general physical manipulations of secret correlations, something currently lacking in the research literature.  Within this framework, new analytic tools will be developed to study the crucial problem of secret key distillation and the broader question of when one type of secret correlations can be transformed into another.  A particular focus will be on generating new secrecy monotones and measures that do not rely exclusively on information-theoretic quantities such as entropy and mutual information.  Additionally, novel cryptographic paradigms will be introduced that are inspired by similar primitives in quantum information theory, such as random entanglement distillation and entanglement combing.  An underlying goal of this project will be to unify classical secrecy and quantum entanglement as physical analogs.  Under such a correspondence, known techniques and results in entanglement theory can be applied in the study of secrecy, and vice versa."

Recently, researchers have discovered innovative ways to harness these surprising features for use in information processing technologies.  Quantum systems are now understood as possessing certain resources such as entanglement, coherence, and nonlocality, which can be applied in next-generation devices.  This research project will study the general mathematical theory of quantum resources.  It seeks to advance the understanding of how non-classical features of quantum mechanics can be measured and manipulated using physical processes that are conducive for experimental implementation.  Ultimately the results of this project will help lay the theoretical foundation for future quantum-based technologies, which include cryptographic, computational, and communication devices.  In attaining its results, this project will help prepare the next generation of scientists by supporting a diverse student workforce. <br/><br/>This research will study quantum resource theories from two complementary perspectives.

In addition, it will investigate structural properties and resource measures in non-convex theories.  As a second research thrust, this project will examine the specific resource theories of quantum nonlocality and generalized quantum measurements.  Rigorous frameworks for these resource theories will be developed that focus on their operational natures.  Furthermore, nonlocality and measurement incompatibility, two fundamental features of quantum mechanics, will be unified as equivalent resources in semi-quantum nonlocal games.

A mass extinction event is currently underway that is many magnitudes greater than previous events recorded in the fossil record. Humanity is widely considered to be in a new period coined the Anthropocene Epoch on account of both extinction rates and the footprints our societies are recording on Earth?s surface. It is not surprising then that species numbers and biodiversity patterns are becoming increasingly relevant to human survival and a rising priority across the world. Biodiversity provides humanity with food, energy, and materials. The biodiversity of plant species can be measured on the ground using calculations such as the total number of species in an area, or the number of species weighted by the portion of area covered by each species. Global biodiversity trends can be collected from satellites but finer scale processes cannot be studied without an expanded network of ground and airborne observations of the same species over short-term intervals (every 1 to 5 years). Remotely sensed and ground based measurements from the National Ecological ObservatoryNetwork are well suited to complete this knowledge gap. This award will combine measurements collected simultaneously from the ground and the Network's Aerial Observation Platform, which has cutting edge optical imaging and three dimensional laser scanning systems onboard, to test the direct mapping of biodiversity variables. A method for measuring biodiversity will be demonstrated at eight Network sites located along a latitudinal gradient in eastern US temperate, broadleaf and mixed forest. Project activities will be conducted over two years at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. Two workshops will be hosted that are designed to involve faculty and students across a network of Primarily Undergraduate Institutions through collaboration with Ecological Research as Education Network participants. Curriculum will be developed that focus on interdisciplinary training of students in field data analysis training, large dataset handling, macroecology theory and remote sensing. Value added remote sensing map products, educational material and the biodiversity processing framework generated from this project will be made available to National Ecological ObservatoryNetwork data users for testing other sites located in additional eco-climatic domains across the Continental US.<br/><br/>Documenting and understanding patterns of biodiversity is a central issue in macroecology. To date, continental to global scale plant diversity mapping has been based on occurrence data, biased by uneven sampling and narrowly focused only on species richness. Vegetation diversity or phytodiversity occurs along a range of temporal, biological, and spatial scales, from genes to species, ecosystems and global biodiversity. Patches or corridors of biodiversity across a local landscape can reflect areas where fine scale patterns of species diversity are mechanistically related to broad scale dynamics as represented by environmental variables. The first component of this project explores an emerging concept in imaging spectroscopy where spatial patterns of reflectance correlate with species diversity (the spectral variation hypothesis). The second component of this project addresses cross-scale interactions and will directly benefit macrosystems biology by enhancing theory on scaling challenges related to spatial heterogeneity and interactions between fine scale species diversity and broader environmental variables across macroscale gradients such as latitude and time since glaciation. The project investigates the following three questions: 1) what are the spatial and spectral detection limits for species diversity mapping with Network Aerial Observation Platform datasets and by extension, how limited is simple species diversity upscaling, 2) what coarser scale natural and human variables are driving species diversity patterns at the site level and where are local diversity hotspots predicted to occur, and 3) how do patterns of and controls on species diversity change along macroscale gradients and how is spatial heterogeneity expected to influence macrosystem mapping and modeling? The value added optical and structural diversity map products that are generated under this award will be useful to larger remote sensing and ecology communities and help provide a basis for new and synoptic exploration of relationships between functional and taxonomic diversity in the US. The optical diversity products can also be used to run simulations that evaluate the role of future satellite-based spectroscopy missions in mapping Essential Biodiversity Variables. Overall processing flows developed through this project will create new methods for identifying potential landscape and genetic diversity hotspots and results can be used to test global biodiversity theories related to latitudinal and elevational distributions."

The richness and large scale of online communication data open up new opportunities for detecting online attacks. However, attackers are motivated to constantly adapt their behaviors to changes in security operations to evade detection. Deception underlies most attacks in online communication, and people are poor at detecting deception. Against this backdrop, this project aims to improve the resilience of solutions to online attacks and enable predictive methods for their detection. Although a complete set of deception behaviors of online attackers is assumed to be unknown, there is a reason to expect that some behaviors are more difficult for attackers to control than others. By identifying such behaviors and their relations in online communication, the project lays the groundwork for the development of resilient and predictive approaches to the detection of online attacks, and advances the state of knowledge on online deception behavior and its identification. At the educational front, the project provides new educational material for enriching the curriculum in cyber security and related disciplines. The interdisciplinary nature of this work contributes to graduate student training toward a new generation of scientists who are capable of conducting multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research using a variety of research methods. The PIs actively engage students at both graduate and undergraduate levels in their research activities, particularly making a strong effort to engage women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Online attackers' evolving behaviors can make the existing solutions to online attacks become ineffective quickly. This project not only discovers new deception behaviors and their relations from the discourse and structure of online communication, but also determines attackers' behavioral control during online attacks by comparing different types of online deception behavior. Further, this project develops techniques for automatic extraction of deception behaviors from online communication by building upon natural language processing and network analysis techniques. Some anticipated advances include: (1) deception theory extension by investigating deception behavior in online attacks via a new lens of behavior control, (2) guidelines on how to improve the resilience of online attack detection methods by identifying deception behaviors that likely escape the attackers' control attempt, (3) a predictive approach to attack detection in online communication by exploring the temporal relationships among deception behaviors, and (4) techniques for extracting deception behaviors from online discourse and structure. This project can lead to integrative and effective methods for online attack detection."

This failure is attributed to the limited ability of adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs = heart muscle cells) to divide and regenerate the lost myocardium.  In contrast, zebrafish hearts fully regenerate after 20% ventricular removal and thus provide a genetically tractable model system for heart regeneration investigations.  While the zebrafish heart has been extensively assessed using immunohistochemistry and DNA and protein analyses to study the roles of different signaling pathways in cardiac development and regeneration, which is thought to have relevance for developing mammalian regeneration therapies, current approaches cannot elucidate the progress of the process (i.e., regeneration) of the same samples over time.  The objective of this project, which builds on the PI's demonstrated ability to obtain quality (favorable high signal to noise ratio) electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in sedated animals, is to provide revolutionary polymer-based wireless devices for long-term acquisition of intrinsic ECG in freely swimming zebrafish models of heart regeneration.  Broader society interests include the promise 1) to enable novel cardiac therapy; 2) to reduce cost and time of drug screening; and 3) to pave the way for numerous comfortable patch-based healthcare wearables for both patients and healthy populations.  Integration of research with education activities are designed to help close the gap of engineering education and biomedical research, including efforts to 1) inspire and train students from different disciplinary and levels to follow higher education and a bioengineering career; 2) to nurture K-12 students directly and indirectly through their teachers by broadening knowledge in state-of-the-art hi-technology applied in bioengineering and medical research; 3) to translate cutting-edge technologies used in rigorous research to real world devices directly supporting society; 4) to engage multidisciplinary personnel from engineering, science and medicine to tackle unmet bioengineering challenge; and 5) to establish international collaborations to exchange innovations as well as to address global issues such as water quality.<br/><br/>Unlike mammalian hearts, which have limited ability to regenerate myocardium after ischemia induced infarct due to the limited capacity of adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) to divide and proliferate, zebrafish (Danio rerio) hearts fully regenerate after 20% ventricular resection.  The central theme of this project lies in the applications of flexible and stretchable microelectronics and wireless power transfer to carry out heart regeneration studies in freely swimming zebrafish models.  The project involves three milestones: 1) Development of flexible and stretchable micro-electrode array (MEA) membranes for long-term recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) in zebrafish models of heart regeneration:  Four working electrodes approximately 200 um in diameter will be placed near the heart and a reference electrode will reside on the body.  2) Design and implementation of a wireless system (an ""ECG Jacket"") including wireless powering (inductive coupling or ultrasound) and data communication for remote and continuous electrocardiac monitoring of freely swimming fish (multiple fish monitored simultaneously) in a circular tank under biological investigations.   3) Deploying the system to elucidate the roles of specific genes towards myocardium regeneration in zebrafish (multiple mutant-like models with injuries induced by either amputation or a cryogenic approach) with potential translations to humans and to demonstrate the translational potentials for i) drug screening (zebrafish will be treated with well-known drugs that affect cardiac activity, e.g. amiodarone and verapamiland) and ii) physiological monitoring in humans with comfortable (flexible and stretchable) and unobtrusive patch-based devices (e.g., ECG, EEG, EOG, EMG, and blood pressure) in the home setting.  The technologies developed will enable long-term (up to 2 months) ECG recordings of specific myocardial sites and thus uniquely determine the overall functionality of the area under investigation without effects of sedation. The conventional view of mammalian hearts as having virtually no regenerative capacity is now questioned by recent animal and human studies, in which new CMs may arise from existing CMs and progenitor or stem cells. The discovery of specific genes' roles towards heart regeneration in zebrafish studies would suggest methods to activate limited regenerative capacity in the human heart, garnering optimism about potential cardiac therapies."

This research is transformative because it will be the first to comprehensively address the slow motion of particle-laden liquids over soft porous material and its related drag reduction. This project will substantially advance understanding of the behavior of slurry flows over highly compressible porous media in which the fiber can act as a lubricating layer, with the potential to vastly increase lift and reduce drag. The experimental methods and analysis techniques developed could also be applied to the motion of suspensions and non-Newtonian fluids over a broad array of structured/patterned surfaces such as hydrophobic surfaces. The insights gathered could significantly advance microfluidic-based devices in a wide range of industrial applications including, biomedical fields, chemical synthesis, (cell) biology, food, and pharmaceutics to drastically reduce friction and wear, leading to improved efficiencies and operating lifetimes for these devices. Teaching materials for this unified subject will be created by introducing suspension flows as an example of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and their interaction with porous media to the engineering students.

The objectives of the proposed project are to 1) develop an analytical model that accurately describes the slow motion of slurries over random arrays of soft porous media with specific mechanical properties by coupling the Brinkman equation with the diffusive flux model, and establishing scaling laws for coupled flows, and 2) experimentally validate that model by a specially designed experimental set-up using pressure drop as a means to measure drag reduction and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) to measurement fluid velocities."

Furthermore, applications that run on mobile devices have even more strict constraints on memory capacity and computational resources. To address these issues, this research develops a new family of machine learning algorithms with faster prediction time and smaller model size.

This is the white space that this proposal covers:  how anisotropy in the viscoelastic properties of a fluid can impact fundamental transport phenomena involving active colloids. A first research thrust will focus on the effect of the anisotropic environment of a liquid crystal suspension has on the diffusivity of a self-propelled particle within the suspension. Specifically, Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations will be combined with experiments involving tracking of single self-propelled colloidal Janus particles at the interface of a nematic liquid crystal. A second thrust will focus on the effects of a suspension of active particles hosted within an anisotropic fluid on the diffusion of passive tracer particles. Motile bacteria dispersed within biocompatible liquid crystals will be used to explore how passive particles diffuse in the presence of the motion of the rod-shaped bacteria. The overall outcome of this integrated program of experiment and simulation will be new knowledge regarding fundamental transport processes driven by internally generated gradients in complex fluids. The collaborating group will establish a collaboration with the Teacher Preparation Program at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez to develop, disseminate and assess bilingual educational modules. Educational activities are proposed to expose students to cross-cultural educational experiences and to prepare them to work in diverse settings. An interdisciplinary class on soft matter will be offered to students at both institutions."

A particular area of promise for these theories is visual recognition, where object detection and image classification approaches need to be able to deal with the highly diverse appearance of real-world objects. However, existing visual recognition methods generally succeed only in the presence of sufficient amounts of homogeneous and balanced training data that are well matched to the actual test conditions. In practice, when the data are heterogeneous and imbalanced, the performance of existing methods can be much worse than expected.<br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive framework for real-world visual recognition based on novel sparse and low-rank modeling techniques, which will be able to deal with imbalanced, heterogeneous and multi-modal data. Imbalanced data will be handled using convex optimization techniques that automatically divide a dataset into common and rare patterns, and select a small set of representatives for the common patterns that are then combined with the rare patterns to form a balanced dataset. Heterogeneous and multi-modal data will be handled using non-convex optimization techniques that learn a latent representation from multiple domains or modalities. Classification and clustering algorithms can be applied to the latent representation. Applications of these methods include image and video-based object recognition, activity recognition, video summarization, and surveillance."

This project involves the research and development of MetaDash, a teacher dashboard that provides information regarding students' cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational self-regulatory learning processes during STEM instruction. The dashboard is informed by multi-modal channels that synthesize information such as student facial expressions, eye gaze behavior, electrodermal activity, and verbalizations.

The research approach investigates (1) how and when to present the multi-channel input based on human-computer-interaction design principles and informed by teacher usability studies; (2) how to optimize statistical approaches to handle unstructured data from multiple sources; and (3) how to create behavioral signatures for constructs such as self-regulation, motivation and frustration using multi-modal measures such as eye-tracking and facial expression.  The ultimate goal of MetaDash is to foster STEM learning by supporting teachers' and students' monitoring and control of CAMM SRL processes. As such, MetaDash will advance current dashboards by providing teachers with: (1) multichannel STEM learning and cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) self-regulated learning (SRL) data collected from students; and (2) individual student and aggregate data to accelerate teachers' decision-making."

The current state-of-the-art techniques use static sensor network to help obtain solutions from complex mathematical models which are often inaccurate and cannot provide timely information. The mobility and adaptability of MSNs make them great candidates for overcoming these challenges. This project will develop a unified framework for modeling, identifying, estimating and predicting behavior of such distributed parameter systems.

Addressing this question poses surprising obstacles, such as the difficulty in optimizing large-scale spaces for experimental testing and controlling for pre-existing knowledge.

Researchers will develop a 2-D treadmill coupled with a head-mounted display to allow free ambulation of large-scale virtual spaces. Successful development of this device has important societal applications. For example, pre-training with enriched body-based cues has the potential to increase knowledge transfer to real world environments, which could be helpful for training individuals such as first-responders and navigation in wilderness environments. Also, the device and proposed experiments will provide a completely novel understanding of the neural basis of human spatial navigation with body-based cues, fundamental to accurately modeling spatial cognition and understanding why we often get lost when we visit new cities.<br/><br/>Almost all theories of the neural basis of spatial navigation, largely developed in freely navigating rodents, assume the critical importance of importance of body-based cues to this code.

As these bacteria are also capable of attaching to electrodes, new techniques for monitoring metal decontamination could harness these sensing systems. The researchers will use molecular techniques to look inside the bacteria, where they will determine how sensing of these metals switches genes and proteins on and off in response to different types of metal surfaces.

However, environmental bacteria have many surface-associated lifestyles distinct from the classic biofilm state. Thus, a grand challenge is to explain how signaling networks utilize only one intracellular output molecule to control diverse adaptations. A recently discovered novel alternative solution has been discovered, based on multiple cyclic dinucleotides that regulate distinct genetic programs. The newfound signal cyclic AMP-GMP (cAG) is required when Geobacter sulfurreducens grows on extracellular metal oxide particles commonly found in sediments and aquifers. In this same organism, the classical signal cdiG is essential for growth as an attached conductive biofilm to relay electrons to methanogens or electrode surfaces. Strikingly, the newfound cAG signaling pathway in Geobacter uses biomolecular parts previously associated with cdiG signaling, revealing cracks in the monolithic model of a cdiG-only signaling network. The sub-class of GGDEF enzymes that synthesize cAG, called DncG, are conserved throughout diverse Bacterial phyla, including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Deferribacteria. However, regulators of DncG activity and downstream effectors that respond to cAG are largely unknown. This collaborative research project will establish a comprehensive parts map and regulatory model for the newfound cAG signaling pathway, build a molecular toolkit to study how it operates alongside classical cdiG pathways in vivo, and define how the signal controls environmentally important phenotypes."

So far, measurements of the magnetism of these particles agree with prediction to a very high precision--much more precisely than those who formulated the theory ever expected. This is despite the fact that the same theory has serious problems: it predicts that no universe would survive after a big bang, and it has not been able to explain why the universe is made of matter rather than antimatter. What is wrong in our mathematical description, and the source of the fundamental imbalance between the properties of matter and antimatter, have yet to be discovered. This project will investigate such problems by measuring an electron's or positron's magnetism even more precisely than before. To do so, a single elementary particle will be suspended for months at a time. Batteries and magnets will keep the charged particle from colliding with any apparatus. Cooling the apparatus to nearly absolute zero will make a nearly perfect vacuum. To measure the magnetism, the separations of the lowest energy levels of the system will be probed by stimulating transitions between these levels using radio waves, and measuring the frequency of the waves that make these transitions occur most rapidly. This project promises to improve the measurement precision by an order of magnitude or more by stimulating two transitions simultaneously. Methods developed as part this project so far are being used to stabilize the magnets in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to analyze the constituents of modern pharmaceuticals via ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) analysis. <br/><br/>In more technical detail, a single electron or positron will be suspended in the electric and magnetic fields of a cylindrical Penning trap.  Refrigeration below 0.1 kelvin will allow cryopumping to produce a nearly perfect vacuum and eliminate blackbody photons from the cylindrical cavity formed by the metal trap electrodes so the electron can radiate down to a cyclotron ground state.  Electromagnetic driving forces will stimulate further cooling of the particle, and others will stimulate changes in its cyclotron and spin state.  These one-quantum changes will be detected using quantum non-demolition methods that keep repeated detections from changing the quantum states of interest.  Spontaneous emission of the particle's cyclotron motion will be inhibited, using a combination of the choice of the magnetic field strength and the cavity size, to give averaging times long enough for detecting a single quantum state of a single particle.  The magnetic moment in natural units is essentially the measured ratio of the particle's spin and cyclotron frequencies, both of which will be measured simultaneously to greatly reduce the effect of tiny but unavoidable drifts of the magnetic field.  The measured magnetic moments, the most precisely measured properties any elementary particle, will test of the most precise prediction of the standard model of particle physics at an unprecedented precision."

To achieve this goal, the PI proposed an educational program that trains next generation engineers to work in collaborative teams of experts, preserving academic rigor in each discipline while simultaneously attaining the broad goals of the technical and environmental design requirements. This is an ideal platform to demonstrate that co-optimization of environmental and performance objectives will not slow progress to market, but instead supply a novel toolset that can provide transformative advances and accelerate discovery.<br/><br/>Novel advanced materials are required to meet several of the NAE Grand Challenges. Carbon nanotubes are particularly well-suited to address two of the primary environmental engineering directives of water access and viable renewable energy. To enable these important applications, the principle investigator (PI) proposes a research program to surmount limitations in carbon nanotube manufacture via: (1) uncovering the chemical mechanisms associated with carbon-carbon bond building during carbon nanotube synthesis, (2) leveraging this mechanistic understanding to exert precision control on nanotube morphology and bond placement, enhancing the atom economy while minimizing unwanted byproduct formation, and, (3) as a consequence, maximizing the material performance while minimizing the environmental impacts at a reduced fabrication cost for a sustained benefit to the national economy. If successful, the proposed work will contribute a fundamental understanding to the fields of heterogeneous catalysis and nanofabrication and unlock the unattained, transformative materials needed to address the world's water, climate, and energy storage needs. Last, because of the intellectual value of the demonstrated simultaneous-optimization platform for all future technologies, this work could have far-reaching and unimagined benefits in the engineering innovation space. Using a novel Mango Tango chemistry/reactor system, the PI proposes that the carbon precursor controls the reaction product, allowing one to tailor the chirality of SWCNT as well as the surface chemistry.  This will allow the production of surfaces that can be used in a variety of applications. In this system, the carbon nanotubes are generated on a fixed substrate rather than in a flowing gas reactor. By using alkynes with different side R groups, the PI can produce a variety of different surface chemistries and dictate the chirality of the product. Student colloquia will address a critical gap in professional preparation trainings and in public communication skills for engineering students."

The research objective of this proposal is to address fundamental questions that arise naturally in network control theory from a probabilistic perspective. In particular, the investigators will address questions such as: how likely is it that a broadcast signal can control a large network. Can media shape public opinion. Can a single leader move public opinion from one state to any arbitrary desired state? The investigators will use state-of-the-art tools in probability and random matrix theory to study such fundamental problems.  One emphasis of the proposal is the synergistic relationship between probability and control theory.  To encourage and assist other researchers, the investigators plan survey works that will emphasis particularly useful probabilistic tools and techniques that one needs to address these types of problems.  Based on this duel relationship, many of the problems discussed by the investigators have the potential to lead to interesting new questions and directions in random matrix theory, which has many applications outside of mathematics including statistics, mathematical physics, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. The proposal also has several educational components including support for graduate study in engineering and mathematics and promoting participation of minorities in higher education in science and engineering.  <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to address fundamental problems and questions in network control theory using recently developed tools from probability and random matrix theory.  Specifically, the investigators plan to analyze the general phenomenon that most systems ""even those of a very discrete nature"" are controllable. One specific motivating example is the question of controllability for Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics on a large network. The investigators plan to analyze such systems by studying the case when the underlying graph or network is random.  To address such problems, the investigators plan to use and extend a number of diverse and involved techniques from probability and random matrix theory including analytic techniques (e.g. resolvent techniques, concentration of measure), algebraic tools (e.g. linear algebra), and probabilistic methods (e.g. Littlewood-Offord theory). Additionally, the investigators also expect the proposed work to be useful to mathematicians, as it will highlight precisely what types of problems and applications exist in other scientific areas.  Besides for the case of Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics, the investigators also plan to address systems formed from directed and weighted graphs as well as a minimum-energy control problem for systems whose parameters are random."

It is a truism that  computers have grown steadily more powerful over the years, but equally important (if not more so) than the amount of sheer computing power available is how efficiently we are able to harness that power.  Finding an efficient strategy to solve a given problem (in the language of computer science, an efficient algorithm) can often spell the difference between success and failure.  (As an illustrative analogy, consider the task of assembling a large jigsaw puzzle.  A poor choice of strategy such as a brute-force approach of trying each pair of pieces against each other may be infeasibly slow, while a cleverer approach such as grouping pieces by their color can be radically more efficient and lead to a feasible solution.)  But in order to fully understand the abilities of efficient  algorithms, it is crucial to also understand their limits: what is it that efficient algorithms *cannot* do? The field of ""computational  complexity"", which is the subject of the PIs' project, seeks to mathematically prove that certain computational problems do not admit *any* efficient algorithm no matter how long and hard we try to develop one.  Such results can have both practical value (by guiding algorithm development away from ""dead ends"") and deep theoretical significance, as they play a profound role in shaping our fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of computation.<br/><br/>The 1980s witnessed exciting progress on a range of Boolean circuit models (a mathematical abstraction of the digital circuits that modern computers are built from) in computational complexity; researchers succeeded in proving many lower bounds establishing that various computational problems have no efficient algorithms in these models.  However, further progress slowed significantly after the 1980s. Many of the landmark results obtained in this era were based on the ""method of random restrictions"", which roughly speaking uses probabilistic arguments to show that Boolean circuits can be dramatically simplified by making certain random substitutions of constant values for input variables.  In this project the PIs will intensively investigate an extension of the method of random restrictions which they call the ""method of random projections."" Rather than simply substituting constant values for input variables, the random projection method additionally identifies groups of variables, ""projecting"" them all to the same new variable so that they must all take the same value.  While the underlying idea is simple, it turns out that this identification of variables helps ""maintain useful structure"" which is extremely useful for proving lower bounds.  In recent work the PIs have successfully used this new ""method of random projections"" to solve several decades-old problems in Boolean circuit lower bounds and related areas (which in some cases had notoriously resisted progress since the 1980s or 1990s).  As the main intellectual goals of the project, the PIs will continue to develop and apply the method of random projections to attack important open problems in Boolean circuit complexity.<br/><br/>In addition to the technical goals described above, other central goals of the project are to educate, communicate, and inspire.  The PIs will train graduate students through research collaboration, disseminate research results through seminar talks, survey articles and other publications, and continue ongoing outreach activities aimed at increasing interest in and awareness of theoretical computer science topics in a broader population, including presentations at elementary schools."

In fact, the fluid dynamics of large, open bodies of water can be quite complex and this proposal addresses large coherent structures that naturally occur in the flow structure of these large bodies of water. The goals of this project are to extend the PI's ONR YIP award into the realm of 3-D, expanding the mathematical and control framework for distributed autonomous sensing and tracking of geophysical fluid dynamics and to understand the long-term impact of geophysical fluid dynamics to improve the autonomy of underwater vehicles. The key idea exploits the capability of the team to cover large regions to increase the spatio-temporal sampling resolution of the flow field. The data will then be processed in a distributed fashion to obtain a global description of the flow dynamics that can be maintained and updated in real-time. The specific objectives that expand prior proposals include not only the 3-D modeling, but the development of an energy efficient stochastic pulse controller for tracking the ridges of the coherent structures and expanding the estimation of the structures through stochastic approaches that allow the fusing of larger teams of sensing entities. The intellectual merit of the proposed work stems from the synthesis of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, transport theory, and robotics to develop a modeling, control, and analysis framework for collaborative unmanned systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. The information gleaned from the coherent structures will be used to refine motion control and resource allocation strategies to determine minimum-effort stochastic control policies for long-term operation in GFD environments. To the PI's knowledge, this is the first attempt to use robots to track and map unstable coherent structures in the ocean, and to exploit knowledge of them to improve the autonomy of AUVs/ASVs.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Success of these endeavors will improve the forecast of weather-climate systems, underwater transport dynamics, and the modeling and prediction of various other physical phenomena in geophysical flow environments. Since the proposed methods are very general and developed for continued operation in dynamic and uncertain environments, success of the proposed activities will likely increase the maneuverability and energy-efficiency of existing AUVs/ASVs; enable teams of AUVs/ASVs to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions as they execute their assigned tasks; and provide greater situational awareness for various scientific, commercial, and military applications in the ocean. In addition, the proposed educational activities include a comprehensive plan to integrate the study of GFD into robotics through online educational modules for general K-12 audiences; an interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate curriculum; and contributions to the robotics community in the form of open source software and hardware development tools."

Current wireless networks can hardly meet this demand because they are interference limited -- per-user throughput decreases super-linearly with network density.  Adding more access points (APs) may worsen the problem, because the APs themselves interfere with each other.  The objective of this research is to overcome this fundamental limitation, and enable network capacity to scale proportionally with node density, by exploring a transformative architecture called Scalable Distributed MIMO (SDM). The principle behind SDM is to reorganize the APs into clusters. Within each cluster, the APs tightly synchronize and share data with each other. This enables them to cancel the mutual interference and scale network capacity with AP density. Different AP clusters contend for channel access in a self-organized manner, thus scaling capacity across an entire network. The long-term objective of SDM is to enable dense indoor infrastructure networks supporting Gbps per-user throughput, marking an important step towards the goals outlined in the National Broadband Plan.  <br/><br/>To realize the SDM principle, the proposed research synthesizes a comprehensive framework of tasks spanning five years, including performance modeling/analysis, network protocol/algorithm design, and implementation/experimentation on a software radio testbed. In particular, the PI plans to (i) systematically explore ways of deploying AP clusters to balance the tradeoffs between system complexity, scalability, and compatibility with legacy networks;  (ii) design a new paradigm of cluster-centric network protocols that feature tight coordination between APs within a cluster and self-organization among different clusters;  (iii) develop new communications algorithms that tame the coordination overhead while maximizing cluster capacity, and translate the capacity gain into improved end-user experience.  The testbed used in the research tasks will be extended into a user-friendly educational platform that enhances the knowledge of wireless networks for students at different levels. The research and educational materials will be broadly disseminated for reproducibility of results."

Processing such a large bandwidth stream of visual information on behaviorally relevant time scales requires the brain to extract and represent information from visual signals efficiently, i.e. represent the most information for the least cost in time, hardware and energy. In essence, the brain needs to compress the visual stream in much the same way that software compresses the digital representation of a movie. This coding enhancement might arise because the brain has evolved coding strategies that specifically account for the fact that because of both object and eye movements, the visual input to the eye may be correlated in space and time. As a result, the visual signals to the brain from the eye and retina may be quite predictable. One of the primary questions in current sensory-motor systems research is to what extent the brain utilizes prediction to compensate for the fact that it takes a finite amount of time to process information even though the visual scene might change in the interim. This proposal focuses on neural representation of visual motion and gaze behavior for natural motion videos and uses a novel video game environment to simplify the analysis of gaze. The project will also create a publicly available database of natural gaze recordings, analyze the statistics of natural retinal image motion, characterize the representation of naturally correlated motion stimuli in cortical neurons, and to articulate the strategy underlying gaze control. This database will benefit neuroscience, computer vision, media design, and other fields.<br/><br/>The experimental approach combines cortical physiology in non-human primates with high-resolution eye movement recording in both humans and monkeys. The PI proposes to use high-resolution videos of natural moving scenes as visual stimuli while recording neural activity in motion-sensitive visual cortex.  By carefully degrading the movies to make them increasingly less natural and measuring the impact on neural responses, the experiments will determine what features of the moving visual scene are represented most precisely.  A second set of experiments will study the interactions between the visual scene and eye movements. The PI will develop an innovative Pong-like video game that actively engages the viewers and creates a common viewing purpose (scoring points) while simplifying the identification of the target of interest to aid analysis, thereby controlling the cognitive state of the viewer. The interdisciplinary nature of the work will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students crossing over from mathematics and physics to neurobiology, and for students with a biology background to gain skills in computational analysis."

For example, in an automotive system, highly critical vehicle-control functions and less critical driver-alert functions might be hosted on the same hardware platform.  While such platform integration may be essential to make more efficient use of platform resources, care must be taken to isolate failures of less-critical components so that more-critical components are not affected. This project is directed at developing new tools, techniques, and methodologies for deriving mixed-criticality system designs that ensure such isolation, particularly on platforms that utilize multicore processors.<br/><br/>The thesis explored in this project is that ensuring both correctness and resource-efficiency in mixed-criticality systems requires the development of fundamentally new perspectives on the modeling of these systems, and different approaches to resource allocation and scheduling.  Specific goals include devising new models for representing mixed-criticality systems, new metrics for quantifying the effectiveness of techniques for designing such systems, and new methods for performing resource allocation and scheduling upon integrated architectures that support mixed-criticality systems.  These new models, metrics, and methods inform the development of new tools and methodologies for deriving mixed-criticality system designs that are both correct by construction and implementable in a resource-efficient manner.  Continuing collaborations with partners in the avionics and automotive industries enable these results to push research on mixed-criticality systems forward to address national industrial needs.  This project is also expected to produce new open-source software and tools, new course content, and public outreach through participation in UNC's demo program (which is aimed at K-12 students, college students, and school teachers) and lectures and seminars by the investigators at national and international forums."

Geoscience is a STEM discipline that is of growing importance to several national and global issues, including climate change, energy resources, and understanding earthquake activity. Expertise in geoscience depends heavily upon unconscious perceptual skills that are difficult or impossible to impart through traditional classroom education. Consequently there is a great need to improve or develop new methods for perceptual training (i.e., training students to visually detect, identify, and interpret geologic processes) and to study how educational practices in this area may be optimized. This project will apply a cognitive science approach to meet this goal, by conducting behavioral experiments involving geoscience students, and developing computational models of human cognition. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>The proposed research will focus on the role of visual working memory (VWM) in perceptual learning and perceptual expertise in the geosciences. VWM is a cognitive system that is critical to the geosciences. For example, when a geologist views or studies a landscape, he or she acquires visual information from multiple points in the scene by making numerous eye movements. The geologist can then (unconsciously) use his or her VWM to integrate information across eye movements to develop a coherent representation of the landscape. While there is much existing research on VWM, very little is known about the relationship between visual working memory on the one hand, and fundamental changes in perceptual ability in specific domains such as geoscience on the other hand. The proposed research will build upon, and extend a recently developed model of human perception that has the potential to connect these two domains. This model is based upon information theory, or the mathematical study of how physical systems can efficiently communicate information.  This model suggests that training and expertise fundamentally change a person?s perceptual system in a way that leads to more efficient use of cognitive resources. In order to test this model, a series of behavioral experiments will be conducted involving novice and experienced students in the geosciences. These experiments and computational modeling efforts will contribute fundamental knowledge that can be used to improve geoscience and education."

A common theme that unites the proposed methods is scalability and identification of their limitations. A popular approach to identifying sparse inverse covariance matrices is through penalized likelihood methods. We propose a novel approach for solving the penalized Gaussian log-likelihood that is faster than its competitors by many orders of magnitude. The second research component in the proposal investigates the statistical properties of thresholded matrices in finite samples, with a view to obtaining a positive definite covariance estimation method which is highly scalable. The third research aspect of the project investigates quantifying the variability and uncertainty of estimated graphical network models. A methodology that takes advantage of a convex pseudo-likelihood formulation of the graphical model selection problem is introduced. This allows for the development of a highly scalable uncertainty quantification method with theoretical safeguards. The fourth research aspect of the project examines the use of the methodology proposed in the previous three sub-components to an application in the area of climate change, where high dimensional covariance estimation is required. The proposal also has a significant teaching and outreach component which aims to introduce statistics to aspiring young scientists at various stages of their undergraduate and graduate studies.<br/><br/>The availability of high-throughput data from  various applications, including genomics, environmental sciences and others,  has created an urgent need for methodology and tools for analyzing high dimensional data. Extracting and making sense of the many complex relationships and multivariate dependencies in the data and developing principled inferential procedures is one of the major challenges facing statisticians and data scientists. The theoretical and methodological work proposed in this project is motivated by applications and interdisciplinary collaborations in fields as diverse as the earth and environmental sciences, genomics and cancer research, and the social sciences. In genomics for instance, one is often interested to know how various genes are associated, and how these associations differ between an experimental (diseased) and control group. Gene regulatory networks also serve as important tools to study the evolutions of diseases. In the context of the climate change debate, modeling temperature at different points on the globe requires parsimonious modeling of the way in which these variables are related. Modeling correlations also arises naturally in material sciences and engineering where one is interested in seeing how different atomic particles interact when new materials are produced.  Hence the proposed project for estimating correlations in very high dimensional settings will  have widespread applications, since understanding associations/relationships between many variables is an endeavor that is common to many scientific disciplines. The proposed work, though firmly rooted in the statistical sciences, is very much interdisciplinary, and involves collaborations and partnerships between statisticians/data scientists and biomedical scientists, engineers and earth scientists."
