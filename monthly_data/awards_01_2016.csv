Most commercially available membranes are composed of a handful of polymers, and are limited in the types of separations they can perform. This project aims to build an integrated research and education plan centered on developing novel membranes with new capabilities by designing polymers that self-assemble to form nanostructures. Specifically, this research will focus on controlling the pore size of a novel family of membranes with high flux, exceptional fouling resistance, and sharp size-based selectivity, prepared by coating zwitterion-containing amphiphilic copolymers on porous supports. This research will lead to the development of improved membranes for separations underserved by existing technologies such as peptide separations and textile wastewater treatment. It will create a link between polymer structure and membrane performance that will enable the rational design of membrane materials for specific applications. The research will be fully integrated with a system of educational activities through the involvement of students at multiple stages in developing and performing outreach activities on polymer science and separations. The team will work closely with Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach (CEEO) to develop new outreach activities for K-12 students. The activity ideas will be initiated as term projects in the PI's courses for undergraduate and graduate students. They will be tested in summer workshops for girls in Malden, MA and also implemented in local schools through the Tufts Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program (STOMP), and disseminated through the STOMP Network. <br/><br/>This project aims to build an integrated research and education plan centered on designing polymeric materials that self-assemble into functional nanostructures that lead to the desired membrane functionality (e.g. selectivity, fouling resistance), and on discovering fundamental relationships that correlate polymer chemistry and architecture, self-assembled nanostructure, and function in membrane applications. The specific research objective of this project is to understand how the chemical structure and molecular architecture of copolymers with hydrophobic and zwitterionic groups, and their processing methods, affect (1) their self-assembled nanostructure and (2) their performance as membrane materials in selective separations. The team aims to control the pore size of these membranes by varying the polymer architecture and processing, and to develop fundamental structure-property-function relationships that serve as design rules for polymeric membrane materials with tunable, precise and monodispersed pore size. For this purpose, the team will synthesize amphiphilic copolymers that combine hydrophobic and zwitterionic monomers in random, comb and star-block architectures. How these materials self-assemble will be studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray scattering. Membranes will be made by coating porous supports with these polymers, and the pore size will be determined by filtration experiments. The pore size, permeability and fouling resistance of membranes will be correlated with the self-assembled morphology. The results will be used to compile design rules or a toolkit for the rational design of membrane materials targeted at specific separations that derive their permeability, selectivity and fouling resistance from their self-assembled structure. The research will be fully integrated with several educational, outreach and mentorship activities, such as the development of outreach activities for K-12 students that introduce concepts in polymer science, self-assembly and separations, incorporation of proposed research into undergraduate lab courses and classes, and involvement of undergraduate students in research."

The data are complex in size, dimension, and structure. The technology for rapidly processing such massive amounts of data is still in its infancy. One of the main goals of this project is to take advantage of some recent mathematical advances to develop and implement fast algorithms for fitting data by smooth functions. This could have many practical applications, for example in the design of automated systems that guide airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles through complex terrains avoiding obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The proposed research carries the hope of advancing obstacle avoidance algorithms -- fast algorithms that can plan an optimal path under various constraints. The project will open new research directions for students and researchers; and it also will enhance our understanding of mathematical theories such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, and nonlinear programming.<br/><br/>This 5-year integrated research and education project focuses on solving variational problems with boundary and/or obstacle constraints on arbitrary subsets in Euclidean space. The approach that the PI proposes is unorthodox: Rather than seeking exact minimizers of energy functionals, the PI will look for functions that minimize the energy functionals up to universal constant multiples. In contrast to the conventional approach to solving variational problems, which involves the solution of a partial differential equation, the PI will construct the solutions directly. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete theory revolving around the belief that any variational problem that can be solved using PDE theory can also be dealt with using extension theory. The special problems the PI will focus on are the obstacle problem, which requires the minimizers to lie above a certain barrier; and the Plateau problem, which seeks a surface of least area with prescribed boundary. Solving variational problems using PDE methods often requires the boundary of the set to have some kind of smoothness. In practice, this is a severe limitation. The novelty of the proposed approach is that there is no need to make any assumption on the geometry or the regularity of the set on which the PI prescribes the boundary conditions or constraints."

The University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC will host the second meeting on the first weekend of December 2016.  The third meeting will be held in April 2017 at either the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, FL, or at Washington and Lee University in Lewisburg, VA.  Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages (below) as it becomes available.<br/><br/>The conferences slated for 2016 will be the 26th and 27th meetings of the Palmetto Number Theory Series http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html , which is a series of meetings started in 2006 and managed jointly by the University of South Carolina and Clemson University, the two flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State.  The Spring 2017 meeting will be the 30th meeting of the Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/, which is a larger regional meeting started in 1988.  Recent meetings have averaged 40 - 60 participants.  The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast.   Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty.  Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks.     <br/><br/>A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own research.  Students and junior researchers in the community particularly benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from other participants.  Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants.  These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds.  The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities."

For example, when we roll a pair of dice, they fly and bounce according to physical laws that are non-random, but the outcome of the roll is nevertheless random.  A more sophisticated example is weather; although we understand atmospheric dynamics and can make reliable short-term predictions, the exact behavior of the weather several weeks from now remains largely random and unpredictable.  The theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems studies the mechanism that drives this evolution from predictability to randomness.  When this mechanism operates consistently no matter what state the system is in, the system is said to be ""uniformly hyperbolic"".  Such systems are well-understood, but this uniformity condition is so restrictive that it rarely applies to physically realistic examples.  A more realistic condition is ""non-uniform hyperbolicity"", where the increase in randomness only happens some of the time, but nevertheless appears eventually for typical initial conditions.  Several different approaches have been used to study non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  The goal of this project is to develop a unified theory of non-uniform hyperbolicity by clarifying and strengthening the connections between these existing approaches; by introducing new tools; and by studying new classes of examples.<br/><br/>Historically, the two most successful approaches to non-uniform hyperbolicity are Pesin theory (introduced in 1976) and Young towers (introduced in 1998).  Recent work by the PI and his co-authors has introduced ""effective hyperbolicity"" and ""non-uniform specification"".  All four approaches study non-uniform hyperbolicity via invariant measures, but the connections between them are not yet clear, and different approaches have different applications.  For example, Pesin theory gives powerful results once an appropriate invariant measure has been selected, but the other three approaches are more useful for finding distinguished invariant measures such as SRB measures and equilibrium states.  Similarly, Young towers yield stronger statistical properties than the other approaches, but construction of a tower may be quite difficult.  Recently Sarig gave a construction of countable Markov partitions using Pesin theory, which allows a tower to be built for any hyperbolic measure, but gives no information on the rate of decay of the tail of the tower, which is necessary for statistical properties such as the central limit theorem.  Preliminary results by the PI and his co-authors give an alternate construction that yields estimates on the decay rate; the PI will develop this approach to obtain strong statistical properties for a broad class of hyperbolic measures, including the SRB measures constructed using effective hyperbolicity and the equilibrium states constructed using non-uniform specification.  As a first concrete example, geodesic flow in non-positive curvature will be considered; these techniques are expected to give rapid decay of correlations for the unique measure of maximal entropy and other equilibrium states, and to give polynomial decay of correlations for the regular component of Liouville measure (subject to geometric conditions on the manifold).  More generally, the connection between the four approaches will significantly strengthen the tools of effective hyperbolicity and non-uniform specification; it will also make the the powerful theory of Young towers easier to apply, and give a precise sense in which all four approaches are equivalent.  A longer-term goal is to extend the class of rigorously understood non-uniformly hyperbolic examples; one important planned application is to Teichmuller flow, which has deep geometrical significance."

At these scales it will be paramount to understand how to harness these quantum effects in order to build more powerful computers. Recently, a new class of materials with unique properties has been discovered, which could play an important role for future information processing technologies. These ""topological insulators"" are electrically insulating in the bulk, but can conduct charge along their boundaries. This CAREER project studies the electronic properties of InAs/GaSb, a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI), a material in which electrons flow through edge channels. This project will first shed light on the effects of impurities on the electrical resistance of these edge channels and determine the role of magnetic interactions on charge flow. Furthermore, recent theoretical work has predicted that a 2D TI placed in contact with a superconductor (a metal which conducts charge without energy losses) can host Majorana states. These novel quantum mechanical states could have a transformative impact on fault-tolerant quantum computing. A second objective of this project is therefore to realize and detect Majorana states in a 2D TI-superconductor device. Beyond training graduate and undergraduate students for future careers in science and the high-technology industry, the principal investigator (PI) will promote broader interest in quantum physics, nanoscience and their applications through activities at local science museums and social media. A central educational goal is to increase the Native-American student participation in physics and STEM by launching an internship in the PI's lab and helping to organize a series of annual week-long summer camps for Native-American high-school students and their teachers at the University of Minnesota. <br/><br/>Technical: This project studies backscattering, confinement, topological superconductivity, and Majorana states in InAs/GaSb double quantum wells, a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI). Understanding backscattering and confinement of 2D TI helical edge modes is a significant open problem in condensed matter physics, and is important for applications that would harness spin-polarized ballistic transport. The research team uses induced quantum dots to simulate charge and spin impurities, which have been theorized to affect backscattering. Nanoscale magnetic insulator barriers are investigated as a means of confining the edge modes using magnetic exchange coupling. 2D TIs are also ideal systems for realizing topological superconductivity and for observing and manipulating Majorana zero-energy modes. Majorana modes have been predicted to exhibit non-Abelian, anyonic exchange statistics, and could play a key role for the development of decoherence-protected topological quantum bits. One of the main objectives of this project is therefore to realize and detect topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. To this end, the research team will investigate hybrid devices made by contacting InAs/GaSb with conventional superconductors. The research project is closely integrated with an extensive educational plan to train graduate and undergraduate students for successful careers in science and the high-technology industry and help educate the broader public about nanoscience. A central goal is to increase Native-American student participation in physics and STEM disciplines."

Unfortunately, such systems have been designed based on ad hoc heuristics (rather than on solid, theoretical foundations) and can be defeated by typical state-level censors. This research project is developing theory, methodologies, and tools to formally design, evaluate, and compare censorship resistance systems. <br/><br/>The researchers are developing a formal model for the Internet censorship problem based on theoretical foundations.

An important part of this project is the design and deployment of effective censorship resistance systems that will provide reliable, sustainable censorship resistance to Internet users. One approach being targeted by the researchers is leveraging emerging communication paradigms such as content caching, mobility, and cloud computing in the design of censorship circumvention tools. The second approach targeted by the researchers is adapting the design of circumvention systems to the architectural evolutions of the Internet. Specifically, the researchers are investigating the impacts of software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) on Internet censorship and adapting the design of circumvention systems to ensure sustainable circumvention performance for the future."

Increased stiffness and stickiness of red blood cells can impair blood circulation and this does occur in many diseases and conditions, including anemias, sepsis, malaria, lupus, heavy metal poisoning, blood transfusion complications, diabetes, cancer, kidney and cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and some neurological disorders. Medicine does not have a complete understanding of the mechanical changes of red blood cells in these conditions.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will advance our knowledge of red blood cell adhesion and deformability in the microcirculation using special built micro-channel devices that have adjustable stickiness where one can see the deformation of the cells as they flow, deform and interact with the micro-vessel walls. The principal investigator will use the beautiful imagery and the scientific art that arises from these experiments to reach out to the community through the Science, Technology and Art (STArt) education program that will be developed in collaboration with the Cleveland Institute of Art. The STArt program aims to stimulate scientific curiosity and interest in high school students through hands-on, scientific art themed workshops.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER award is to test the hypothesis that a red blood cell's adhesion affinity is a function of its deformability and phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer membrane surface. The exceptional deformability of the red blood cell is facilitated by its membrane skeleton, which is physically connected to the adhesion receptors. Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid located on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. Even though the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane surface has been correlated to adhesion, its role in red blood cell's increased adhesion affinity remains unclear. The research will systematically investigate, at the single cell level, the biomechanical properties of live red blood cells in microphysiological blood flow. The new knowledge gained will answer important questions: (1) which of the red blood cell receptors are associated with higher adhesion affinity and lower deformability? (2) Is the adhesion affinity a surrogate measure of red blood cell's deformability, phosphatidylserine translocation, and function? (3) Can the unhealthy red blood cells be identified and excluded from the circulation solely based on their adhesion affinity and reduced deformability? Proposed research will pioneer an integrated understanding of red blood cell adhesion and deformability, which may be pertinent to any disease accompanied by microcirculatory impairment."

It is also a field ripe for modern statistical development, since nonparametric models are in a sense even more appealing in the ""big data"" era, as it is precisely in data-rich settings that the increased flexibility of these models will begin to show real rewards in terms of statistical accuracy. The proposed work will develop nonparametric methods (and affiliated software) that will be useful to data scientists who model smooth, nonlinear trends in areas like those mentioned above, as well as many others.

Such forecasts will help policy makers design and implement more effective countermeasures towards these diseases. The proposal puts forward two main ideas for educational training, closely related to the research aims to be pursued. The first is a set of short videos on nonparametric smoothing, intended as supplements to an undergraduate level course called Advanced Methods for Data Analysis. They will be integrated with an interactive quiz system, and will be made freely available (on YouTube) so that others outside the class may watch too. The second idea is a statistical computation training group, for PhD students from Statistics and Computer Science.<br/><br/>""Locally adaptive"" nonparametric methods offer more fine-grained flexibility than traditional nonparametric methods, in that they can simultaneously represent different amounts of smoothness at different parts of the function domain. Currently, locally adaptive nonparametric methods are not often used in big, modern data sets, likely because of their computational inefficiency, and the general inavailability of locally adaptive methods in many modern problem settings. The proposed work seeks to change this, and to push the state of the art in modern locally adaptive nonparametric estimation. The research aims are to: deepen the theoretical understanding of existing locally adaptive methods for univariate problems; efficiently scale these methods and extend these theories to problems where data are collected in high dimensions and over graphs; and develop inferential tools for all of these locally adaptive procedures. The specific contributions will be balanced between the theoretical (statistical theories that describe the underpinnings of the methods in question) and computational (practical algorithms that describe implementation of these methods at scale) perspectives. A final more applied research aim is to use the proposed methods to improve and extend a forecasting system for major epidemics such as influenza and dengue fever."

Current methods for this rely on multi-step and high energy consumption operations. Inspired by the efficiency of biological separation processes that seamlessly capture and transport selective biomolecules, this project seeks to achieve a concerted ""catch and release"" of target molecules from a liquid mixture using responsive polymer-based material systems. The innovation arises from the programmed one-step sorting with low turnaround times. The modular design of the hybrid material system is highly customizable owing to its broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics, and physical simplicity. This project's career development plan provides the foundation for a long-term research program in highly efficient capture and isolation of molecules in flowing fluids. Ultimately, this technology platform may lead to the next-generation in-line separation, sensing, and monitoring technologies and be translated into broader areas of smart technology, robotics, bioengineering, and other autonomous systems. A variety of integrated research and educational activities are planned to develop bioinspired engineering curriculum by integrating the research and online media at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels and to increase public awareness of bioinspired technologies and their societal impacts.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to apply the bioinspired strategy that seamlessly separates biomolecules in a single step to innovate adaptively reconfigurable material systems based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels and to realize continuous ""catch and release"" of target molecules from a liquid mixture. This research explores fundamental questions of molecular binding affinity in different chemical environments that would facilitate the discovery of new adsorbents. To assess the separation performance of the system, quantitative sorting efficiency evaluation, system robustness examination with amenability to multiple separation cycles, and optimization will be conducted. Practically, the systems encompass significant modularity and design flexibility to permit integration and upscaling for broad applications. This research integrates the disciplines of chemistry, materials, and chemical engineering. Diverse education and outreach activities are planned to promote research, education, and awareness related to bioinspired engineering and separation research fields. These include the development of a bioinspired engineering course on campus integrated with an online channel, and female undergraduate,  graduate, and K-12 students participation in the research project, using existing infrastructure in the ASU High School Summer Academy, the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative program, and public media."

Stationary energy storage is the key enabler for intermittent renewable energy resources, including solar and wind. The nature of stationary applications requires the storage technologies to have low cost, long cycle life and most importantly scalability and sustainability. Although lithium-ion batteries have dominated the market in electronics and electric vehicles, lithium is generally too expensive to be used in stationary applications. This calls for alternative technologies based on earth-abundant elements, such as sodium and potassium. To date, attention has focused on sodium-ion batteries. To broaden the field, the PI has shown that a broad array of carbon materials can reversibly store potassium ions with promising performance for energy storage applications. This project will determine design principles for carbon anodes using potassium ion chemistry. On the educational side, the project will bring state-of-the-art knowledge of energy storage to underserved students in Oregon rural schools by developing a new Science-Tour program. This will be eventually expanded to include other OSU faculty. This new program will benefit a large number of students who do not have access to on campus activities at a university. Additionally, the project will integrate training of high school and undergraduate students into the research program to accelerate discoveries on campus.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this CAREER award is to elucidate design principles for carbon anodes by determining the structure-property relationships in potassium ion batteries. The PI plans the following activities: (1) Identify the functional substructures that are responsible for K-ion storage in bulk carbon electrodes by investigating the evolving structural and kinetic properties during K-ion insertion via advanced in situ and ex situ characterizations; (2) Determine the structure-property correlation by creating new carbon structures with features controlled at nanometer and atomic scales; and (3) Develop and disseminate energy science activities to bring STEM inspiration to underserved students. This project will test the assumption that bulk carbon anodes cannot reversibly store potassium electrochemically at room temperature. Furthermore, this project will use potassium ion batteries as a platform to generate knowledge on the substructures in non-graphitic carbon anodes that are responsible for metal ion storage. This question will be addressed by exploiting the structural distortion of carbon electrodes generated by insertion of large potassium ions, which can reveal invaluable information of structural properties of non-graphitic carbons with a resolution at nanometer and atomic scales. To observe structural distortion, the project will employ neutron scattering, in situ TEM and electrochemical titration techniques. In addition, the project will draw upon the demonstrated capability of the PI on rational design of carbon local structures to reveal the impact of substructures on electrochemical performance. The unique combination of close observation and fine-tuning of carbon structures at an atomic scale will generate fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationships for carbon anodes. This will lead to elucidation of new design principles for carbon materials for metal-ion batteries. The research may cause a paradigm shift for the battery community, while initiating a new frontier on understanding and designing carbons for various purposes."

Solar cells that capture the sun?s rays and convert this energy into electricity can potentially be improved through the science of photonics, which uses advanced materials to guide the light pathway through the device. This project will develop photonic structures which contain nanocrystal-polymer composite materials that split and concentrate the solar spectrum into its component wavelengths, and then direct the concentrated specific wavelengths to semiconductor materials that are best able to convert these wavelength energies into electricity. Through the combination of these processes, the overall efficiency for solar energy conversion can be increased.  The proposed research targets designs that can be readily implemented with existing solar cell fabrication processes and could also be integrated into architectural features for buildings. These photonic materials may also find other applications in biological imaging for medical diagnostics, solid-state lighting, and display technology.  This project also has broad educational goals coupled to the research activities, aimed at encouraging women and underrepresented minorities into STEM careers through project-based learning about solar energy.<br/><br/>This project will address a fundamental challenge in solar photovoltaic conversion of sunlight to electricity - the mismatch between the broad solar spectrum and semiconductors that only efficiently convert light at wavelengths near their bandgap energy.  In conventional multi-junction solar cells, the light must transfer through a stack of semiconductor layers designed to capture a portion of the solar spectrum.  The transfer of light through this stack results in absorption losses that lower the theoretically-attainable solar energy conversion efficiency.   The splitting of the solar spectrum into component wavelengths and the direction of these wavelengths to adjacent semiconductors, as opposed to within a stack, can reduce losses and improve solar energy conversion efficiency.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop an efficient spectrum splitting system for enhancing solar energy harvesting using optical materials that combine photonic structures with luminescent nanocrystal-polymer composite materials.  Towards this end, the proposed research seeks to gain a fundamental understanding of the interaction of these nanocomposite materials with various photonic structures for harvesting of light.  The research plan has three primary objectives. The first objective is to consider photonic routes for enhancing the efficiency of solar spectrum splitting based on nanocomposite luminescent concentrators.  For example, by incorporating light trapping elements such as Bragg mirrors into luminescent concentrators, luminophore quantum yield can be increased.  The second objective will address loss mechanisms by tuning the properties of luminescent nanocrystal-polymer composite materials.  For example, a photonic crystal consisting of alternating high index and low index nanocrystal-polymer composites could reduce losses within the luminescent concentrator.   In the third objective, photonic nanocrystal-polymer composite materials will be integrated into single-junction solar photovoltaic cells to serve as luminescent concentrators that provide controlled angles of emission, reduced absorption loss, and enhanced radiative decay rate. The design principles established through the single-junction device will be used to develop a spectrum splitting and concentrating system for multi-junction solar cells that harvest a larger fraction of the solar spectrum using nanocrystal luminophores engineered with different bandgaps. Theoretical approaches will link nanoscale properties and photonic structures to their performance as waveguides that accept diffuse sunlight and direct it to adjacent solar cells. This information will used to predict the upper limits of efficiency for single and multi-junction solar cells.  Experimental work will include synthesis of nanocrystal-polymer composites, correlation of the composite nanostructure to optical response, and fabrication of photonic structures.  Optical spectroscopy and electron microscopy will be used to characterize the light propagation inside the concentrators. The proposed research is integrated with educational activities that focus on project-based learning about solar energy across educational and outreach platforms, including the development of introductory lecture and laboratory coursework materials, the creation of a program for undergraduate women to learn about undergraduate research opportunities in solar and related sustainable energy systems, and outreach to K-12 students that emphasizes the role of engineering in addressing societal goals."

Growing availability of digital health records has created many opportunities for transforming health care delivery facilities such as hospitals, potentially improving their quality and operational efficiency. For example, recent research shows the benefits of guiding decisions in a hospital via statistical predictions. However, predictions are worthless when they cannot be integrated with the organization's workflow. In this regard, new ways of combining predictions with operations research models are needed. This research tackles mathematical barriers to the integration of operations research and statistical modeling. An example of this integration would be building new optimization algorithms that can adapt to patterns of uncertainty in the data at hand. The findings of this research can potentially improve quality of medical care and reduce health care costs. In addition, because this research lies at the intersection of machine learning, medicine, operations research, and statistics, it can help train the next generation of academic scholars (with emphasis on underrepresented groups) on this multidisciplinary area.<br/><br/>A common theme of statistical models in the age of big data is to characterize uncertainty via parametric or non-parametric models in a ""high dimensional"" space. High dimensional space refers to the space of available predictor variables that could contain information about uncertain outcomes in a decision task. Models based on high-dimensional data are particularly useful in healthcare because healthcare systems are complex, with many system-specific features in their patient populations and practice patterns. Such potential applications have led to a large body of recent literature (known by high-dimensional statistics) to deal with algorithmic and statistical challenges of such modeling framework. In contrast, in the operations research literature, the uncertainty is typically restricted to few known probability distributions to make mathematical analysis more tractable. This research aims to relax the aforementioned restrictions by combining ideas from the high-dimensional statistics with the mathematics of operations research, and applying the resulting models to two application areas -- wait time prediction in emergency departments, and personalized administration of new treatments. For example, in settings that can be modeled as multi-armed bandit problems, new theory that can help reduce the uncertainty in decisions by utilizing availability of many predictor variables in addition to the data on past decisions can be useful. Reducing this knowledge gap requires developing a new class of algorithms and asymptotic theory when the number of predictors grows faster than time periods or the number of samples. Another challenge that needs to be addressed is that in statistical setting the samples are usually assumed to be independent, however this assumption fails in decision systems with feedback where current decisions may impact future samples."

This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory.

The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles."

The cell membrane sits on a supporting intracellular matrix called cytoskeleton layer that defines cell shape and further stabilizes LB.  Ion channels and molecular receptors of membrane proteins on LB are the main targets of fundamental research and pharmaceutical drugs.  As such, model LBs have been the crucial platform to study transport and signaling processes of membrane proteins.  However, current model LBs suffer from notorious limitations including (1) short LB lifetime, (2) fluidic and/or electrical inaccessibility to both sides of the membranes, and (3) lack of the rich constituents of natural cell membrane.  Addressing these limitations of model LB systems should significantly expedite both fundamental biological studies and pharmaceutical drug screenings. <br/><br/>This proposal outlines a five-year program of integrated research and educational activities focusing on the development of highly stable lipid bilayers (HSLB) in microfluidic networks.

The fabricated HSLB will be characterized and compared with current model LBs, applied to study ion channel activities and the virus-cell membrane fusion process, and scaled up for other research and industrial users.  Compared to current suspended and supported LBs, the developed HSLB system will provide long-term stability, better replication of cell membranes and ease of scaling-up, as well as enabling simultaneous fluidic, electrical and optical measurements and manipulations.

The lack of robust GB structure-property relationships is considered to be one of the biggest obstacles to understanding the behavior of polycrystalline materials. To analyze the properties of GBs, it is necessary to first understand the way in which atoms are arranged at these defects. The atomic level structure of GBs may range from a highly ordered packing to a completely disordered arrangement (such as those observed in metallic glasses) depending on  five crystallographic degrees of freedom. To investigate such a diverse array of atomistic structures, the PI and his team will develop a novel geometrical framework to quantify the atomistic structure of GBs as three-dimensional polyhedral units. The objective is to reduce the complexity of GBs to a minimal set of fundamental structural units. Such a classification will facilitate an efficient computation of  structure-property relationships. <br/><br/>This CAREER award also supports the integration of outreach with research.

The mechanisms for the evolution of microstructural features are profoundly influenced by the grain boundary (GB) properties (energies, and mobilites) and their anisotropies. A wide array of failure phenomena such as fatigue, stress corrosion cracking, creep, failure under dynamic and shock loading etc. are controlled by the mechanical properties of GBs in structural materials. Even the design of novel damage resistant structural materials requires the quantification of the structural features and the properties of interfaces.<br/><br/>To better understand the atomistic structure and quantify the variation in GB structure as a function of GB crystallography, a new class of fundamental grain boundary structures, which will provide the basis set for the prediction of the structure and energy of a general interface in the complete five-dimensional crystallographic parameter space, will be identified. In order to compute this minimal set of interfaces, the PI and his team will develop an efficient and automated GB structure simulator. GBs of varying crystallographic character in the structurally simple mono-atomic, face-centered cubic metallic systems (Al, Ni and Cu) will be simulated. The Voronoi network and the Delaunay tessellation of the atoms in the GB will be analyzed to compute a three-dimensional polyhedral Structural Unit Model (SUM) and a favored set of GBs will be identified. Reduced order models for thermodynamic properties of GBs will be evaluated with the zero-Kelvin GB energy as a model thermodynamic property. The kinetic properties, such as GB mobility, will be analyzed through the analysis of the soft vibrational modes of the favored set of GBs.<br/><br/>This CAREER award also supports the integration of outreach with research.

At the oceanic mesoscale (about 10 to 100 km scales), advection is sufficiently strong to create strong gradients in sea surface temperature. As air blows across these very sharp fronts, the atmosphere cannot fully adjust, which leads to significant effects such as atmospheric cooling (warming) of warm (cold) sea surface temperatures. These effects are well pronounced in the Southern Ocean, where powerful mesoscale variability abounds. The main goal of this project is to explore mesoscale atmosphere-ocean interactions in the Southern Ocean and to understand how the ocean mesoscale creates sharp sea surface temperature fronts that modulate these interactions. This study will serve to inform global climate modeling efforts in terms of the identifying the key processes and required ocean resolution needed to correctly capture air-sea interactions. The project will advance a career of a female investigator and will train two graduate students in the fields of Physical Oceanography and Climate Science.<br/><br/>Atmosphere-ocean coupling at mesoscale plays an important, but poorly understood role in climate variability, atmosphere and ocean dynamics, uptake of atmospheric gases and biogeochemistry. Understanding of this coupling has large practical importance for climate modeling, because a vast majority of climate models cannot fully resolve the mesoscale, which leads to biases in the simulations. The main hypothesis of this project is that a significant part of the sea surface temperature anomaly variability at the oceanic mesoscale is driven by mesoscale oceanic advection. The analysis will be carried out in a fully coupled model system in which mesoscale sea surface temperature anomalies both affect and are affected by the atmosphere, and the study will employ a blend of advanced theoretical considerations, comprehensive coupled simulations and targeted idealized studies, all with high resolution in the ocean. The particular focus of this study is on the Southern Ocean, both because of its large role in climate and because mesoscale variability is ubiquitous there, but our conclusions are expected to be relevant to the other parts of the World Ocean.  One particular strength of this research is the merging of comprehensive climate simulations with a combination of idealized modeling and theory, in a fully coupled regime and with dynamically consistent mesoscale ocean circulation."

One group of molecules that are important for nerve cell migration (called Ephrins) exist as multiple types in mammals, making their detailed functions difficult to study. Taking advantage of the fact that insects (including the tobacco hornworm Manduca used here) produce a single type of Ephrin protein, a molecule (RACK1) that Ephrin interacts with in a major way during nerve cell development has been identified. This project will determine how RACK1 works together with Ephrin to regulate nerve cell migration and circuit development. The new discoveries made during this project will provide valuable information about how Ephrins function during nervous system development in more complex animals, including the human brain. The project will also provide unique opportunities for undergraduate students to learn advanced methods for investigating how specific proteins regulate nerve cell growth. Students will conduct experiments in Manduca to test the role of Ephrin and RACK1 in this process, and to identify other proteins that are required for Ephrin function. The data and resources produced by this project will be presented at major scientific conferences, published in scientific journals, and be posted on web sites that are freely available to other scientists and to the public. In addition, discoveries from this project will be presented to more general audiences at the Oregon Health and Science University Brain Fair, an interactive educational opportunity that is held annually at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.<br/><br/>This project will investigate how type-A Ephrins (which are attached to cells by GPI lipid anchors) can regulate the activity of intracellular tyrosine kinases in the Src family, and how this signaling pathway controls the migratory behavior of developing neurons. Preliminary studies indicate that the adapter protein RACK1 (Receptor of Activated Protein Kinase C) functions as a molecular rheostat that restricts Src signaling until MsEphrin signaling is initiated. Studies will be carried out using a well-characterized assay of neuronal migration in cultured Manduca embryos. Targeted manipulations of gene expression will test whether RACK1 is essential for the activation of a specific Src kinase (Src42) by type-A Ephrins. Biochemical assays of Src activity and Src-RACK1 interactions will test whether RACK1 functions as both a regulator and substrate for Src42 in this process. Time-lapse imaging and quantitative assays of neuronal migration will be used to investigate how this signaling pathway affects specific aspects of neuronal behavior in the developing nervous system. Similar methods will test whether a toll family protein (Toll-7) functions as a novel co-receptor for type-A Ephrins in this pathway. These experiments will also permit the downstream effectors of type-A Ephrins to be identified in related projects that will be conducted by selected undergraduate participants."

Of particular interest is the coupling of the lower atmosphere to the ionized layer near 100-150 km that is called the ""dynamo region"". Large-scale wave variations of winds and temperatures in the lower atmosphere that are called thermal tides are generated by the heating caused by the daily passage of the Sun overhead or by the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor or stratospheric ozone at tropical latitudes. Other large-scale waves called planetary waves (PW) may also be caused by weather activity within the lower atmosphere. These large-scale waves may have periodicities as long as 16 days and very large horizontal wavelengths (thousands of km).  These waves will propagate to higher altitudes where the winds, ionized gas content, and Earth?s magnetic field interact to generate electric fields and currents.  These, in turn, will induce magnetic field perturbations that may be measured by the global network of magnetometers (141 sites). The production of PW and tidal waves within the lower atmosphere is highly variable, and consequently, the winds and temperature profiles associated with these wave structures will exhibit significant variability from day-to-day that can be detected through the application of sophisticated analysis procedures to the global magnetometer data.  Part of the research motivation for this approach is that the electric fields generated within the dynamo region will map upward into the ionosphere above 250 km and generate variability of electron density at high altitudes that need to be understood for successful space weather forecasting, which has been given national priority. The research supported by this award would determine the ionospheric variability using the magnetometer data to measure the meridional and zonal components of magnetic field variations relative to a steady state baseline. The origins of this variability can then be considered in regard to possible factors to identify causal relationships. The award represents a strong potential for exciting and transformative science because the global analysis of ground magnetometer data will provide new insights into atmosphere-ionosphere coupling by tides and PW in a way that cannot be achieved by any satellite-based series of observations that is limited by the nature of local time sampling of the ionospheric variability.  The broader impact of this award is that a woman Egyptian graduate student would be supported in her PhD work in this award thus enhancing the cultural diversity of the aeronomy community.<br/><br/>The science motivation for this award is summarized by the following list of physical processes that need to be fully understood to understand space weather variability: (1) The dynamo region (ca.100-150 km) of Earth?s atmosphere is where electric fields are mainly generated through the dynamo action of neutral winds during daytime; (2) These electric fields have profound influences on the variability of the whole ionosphere; (3) Dynamo region variability is thought to originate from solar flux influences on electrical conductivity, and from the variability imposed by tidal and PW neutral winds, and disturbance winds associated with geomagnetic activity; (4) This variability has never been observationally quantified globally in a systematic way; (5) Knowledge concerning the variability of the dynamo region provides insight into the sources of variability for the overlying ionosphere; and (6) A global array of ground magnetometers exists that can provide the above knowledge.  Examination of the global magnetometer data through application of standard time-series analysis tools would seek to understand the cause-effect factors underlying the ionospheric variability with the focus being that a major fraction of this ionospheric variability is likely to be caused by the large-scale waves reaching into this region from below. These results would be compared with variations of the standard solar and magnetic field indices to search for evidence of causal relationships between the tides and PW excited in the lower atmosphere and whose influences extend into the 100-150 km dynamo region generate electric fields that then map along magnetic field lines into the F region ionosphere. The F-region plasma redistributions that they produce carry with them the spatial and temporal signatures of these tides and PW, and of the processes that produced or modified them at lower altitudes."

The confluence of these enormous crowdsourced data can contribute to an inexpensive, sustainable and large-scale decision system that has never been possible before. Such a system could vastly improve the efficiency and cost of transportation, healthcare, and many other applications.  The main obstacle in building such a system lies in the problem of information veracity, i.e., individual users might provide unreliable or even misleading information.  This project identifies important research questions in the task of mining reliable information from noisy and unreliable crowdsourced data, and pursues an integrated research and education plan to address these questions.  Through integrating data from various sources, this project addresses information veracity, which will benefit the many applications where crowdsourced data are ubiquitous but veracity can be suspect.<br/><br/>In particular, this project develops novel methods to mine reliable information by taking into consideration various properties of crowdsourcing: 1) Crowdsourcing platforms collect users' observations about certain objects. Other valuable information sources, such as spatial-temporal, user influence, and textual data, are leveraged to effectively detect reliable information from these observations. 2) Effective privacy protection and budget allocation mechanisms are designed to better motivate active crowdsourcing. These investigations are integrated with the exploration of both theoretical and practical aspects of the proposed methods. From the theoretical perspective, fundamental questions regarding the confidence in the estimated reliability and the convergence of the proposed methods are explored. From the practical perspective, the proposed methods are adapted to tackle challenging problems in various applications such as transportation, healthcare and education to enable new insights into these domains.  In addition to the research advances, this project contributes to educational innovation, as the proposed methods are applied to educational methodologies such as peer assessment and question answering.

They are found in natural settings, such as landslides, mudslides, and underwater avalanches, and in industrial settings, such as in tailings from mining operations.  The goal of this CAREER project is to develop experimental and modeling methods to examine the fluid dynamical behavior of slurries when the viscous liquid that conveys the particles exhibits complex behavior on its own.  The experiments will cover a wide range of flow regimes, and the results will fill an important knowledge gap in understanding the flow characteristics of slurries.  This understanding is essential to make accurate predictions of how natural disasters start and spread and to avoid or reduce their impacts.  Data acquired in the project will be useful to researchers who are interested in developing new models of slurries and to practitioners who develop equipment to process these complex materials.  In addition, results from the project will be incorporated into classes at Ohio University. Researchers working on the project will participate in a variety of outreach programs, including TechSavvy, a career conference for girls and the adults who support them, and a residential Technology Camp for high school girls that provides opportunities for young women to explore careers in engineering and technology.<br/><br/>This CAREER project focuses on the development of experimental and modeling techniques to investigate rheological properties of slurries in which the suspending liquid by itself exhibits non-Newtonian behavior, including a yield stress and shear-thinning.  For example, this is the case in mine tailings and debris, where small colloidal particles impart non-Newtonian behavior to the suspending liquid that affects the rheology of suspensions of larger, noncolloidal particles.  The experiments will span low-Reynolds number to inertial regimes, and will determine the particle pressure tensor and the kinetics of shear-induced migration of the particles.  Radiography and three-dimensional micro-tomography will be used to determine the local volume fraction of the particles and the local stress components.  Particle imaging and tracking velocimetry will be used to characterize the underlying microstructure, i.e., the spatial and temporal arrangement of the particles, and connect it to the macroscopic rheology of the slurry.  Results will be used to develop accurate theoretical frameworks to model geophysical flows and predict initiation, spreading dynamics and runout, which will help limit the impact of natural disasters."

However, the efficiency of the process has been low due to low energy of individual discharges and accumulation of debris particles in the inter-electrode gaps, especially, when machining micro-scale features. Further, the electro discharge machines use pressure flushing techniques that result in consumption of significantly higher amount of dielectric than needed for an effective discharge process. This award supports research to study an atomized dielectric-based electro discharge machining process that can reduce the consumption of the dielectric 10-20 folds and helping to achieve an environmentally sustainable machining process. The new process will offer unique capabilities of manufacturing high-accuracy components and devices with complex geometries. In addition, the quantitative understanding of plasma discharges in flowing liquid will be useful in a number of plasma applications ranging from water purification to plasma medicine.<br/> <br/>The overall goal of this research is to improve the efficiency of the micro-electro discharge machining process and produce an environmentally-sustainable machining process by reducing the consumption of hazardous dielectric. The approach is to atomize dielectric and produce a thin moving film that fills inter-electrode gap and flushes out the debris efficiently. This research has four specific objectives: (1) to understand film formation, flow characteristics, melt-pool formation, and debris flushing; (2) to understand the formation, collapse, and discharge of plasma in liquid medium; (3) to establish the relationship between the trajectory of the debris and the dielectric velocity; and (4) to establish relationships between process parameters and machining characteristics (discharge energy, material removal, and debris flushing). To achieve these objectives, a film formation model will be developed using mass and momentum transfer from the dielectric droplets in the spray; a spatially-resolved three-dimensional plasma model will be developed using a fluid-based approach; and the debris flushing model will be developed using the force balance at the flowing debris particle in the inter-electrode gap. To validate these models, experimentally measured data will be compared to model predictions. Film thickness will be measured using high-speed camera, plasma temperature and electron density will be measured using spectroscopy, and debris particle distribution around the discharge location will be determined from the measurements of different sized debris particles using scanning electron microscope."

Environmental conditions can cause changes in the characteristics of individuals, including their morphology, physiology, development, and behavior. Such environmental effects can be ephemeral, or they can persist for whole lifespans or even beyond a single generation. Studying such effects is central to our understanding of the process of evolution, especially as it might be affected by climate change. Epigenetics refers to mechanisms that alter how genetic sequences are translated into functional gene products, and certain epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in environmental effects on the characteristics of individuals. It has been argued that epigenetic modifications that are stable across generations can be an important source of genetic variation upon which natural selection can act, and that such variation may even be non-random with respect to environmental context and adaptive value. This hypothesis raises a number of compelling questions. First, which epigenetic changes are environmentally induced, and do environment-dependent versus independent changes differ in their stability of inheritance? Second, is the stability of epigenetic alterations itself heritable? Third, is the stability of epigenetic modifications adaptive, and if so, under what conditions? Additionally, this project will train students from high school to graduate school and promote international engagement by graduate students and post-doctoral scholars.<br/>	<br/>The research program will use Arabidopsis thaliana to test for natural variation in the stability of genome-wide methylation states within and across generations, to test whether such stability depends on environmental conditions, and to test whether environmentally induced changes in methylation state are more or less stable than methylation that does not respond to environmental conditions. As such, it tests the prediction that environmentally-induced epigenetic changes can be an important source of heritable phenotypic variation that can contribute to adaptive evolution. Second, a QTL analysis of methylation states, their stability, and their environmental reversibility will test whether methylation stability has a genetic basis. It will also provide information on the number of methylation states that are regulated by a given QTL, and it will test whether loci that regulate methylation stability within and across generations are genetically associated with loci that regulate their environmental reversibility/stability. Finally, the research will test whether loci that regulate methylation states and their stability are also associated with adaptively significant phenotypes and with fitness itself under constant and variable environments. This research targets the stability of epigenetic changes as a key phenotype by testing whether epigenetic stability has a heritable genetic basis and whether it is adaptive under stable and variable environments."

Drought and wildfire caused by changing precipitation patterns, increased temperatures, increased fuel loads, and decades of fire suppression are reducing forest carbon uptake from local to continental scales.  This trend is especially widespread in Idaho and the intermountain west and has important implications for climate change and forest management options. Given the key role of forests in climate regulation, understanding forest responses to disturbance and the feedbacks to the atmosphere is a key research and policy-relevant priority in the U.S. and elsewhere. As temperature, fire, and precipitation regimes continue to change and influence forest mortality, there is a growing potential role for drought and fire mitigation efforts such as forest thinning. This research will evaluate the climate impacts of restoration thinning, a forest management activity aimed at reducing drought- and fire-related mortality, by combining new experimental plot data and earth system modeling.  This project has three main goals: 1) quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of thinning on net regional greenhouse gas emissions and climate, 2) evaluate the impact of thinning on forest resilience to drought and disturbance, and 3) contribute to education of students and teachers about the role of forests in climate regulation.<br/><br/>By integrating novel, field-based technology, existing datasets, and state-of-the-art earth system modeling, this research will yield scientific insights into both climatic and management controls on tree growth as well as forest-atmosphere gas exchange in the mixed conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains in Idaho. The project objectives will advance the current understanding of how disturbance impacts forest carbon, water, and energy balance at time steps from minutes to years, which is crucial for earth system model development and evaluation. Improved earth system modeling and existing long-term ecological research data will be used to make predictions of forest-atmosphere interactions for the intermountain west over the 21st century. This will improve policy-relevant understanding of forest management practices and forest climate regulation. Additionally, this project will contribute to science education. Students and educators will be actively engaged in climate and forest science research through collection and sharing of data and will learn how forests capture and release carbon dioxide, and how these processes influence climate."

Traditionally, sensors have been understood narrowly, often as physiological measurements.  This project envisions sensing in broader, new ways, as time-evolving measurable data directly linked to individuals and, by extension, to their communities. With this understanding, sensing data may involve language, social network and environment signals, or emotional-creative reactions.  This REU site will: (1) advance fundamental research in computational sensing; (2) expose students to a research environment that innovatively blends computer and information science and computational liberal arts, infused with career-enhancing learning elements, and (3) ensure that transformative research experiences reach an unusually diverse student group of underrepresented subpopulations in computer science.<br/><br/>The projects link in applications that students can directly relate to and that enable them to make concrete, real-world contributions. Further, the increasing demand for collaborative team science requires a new generation of scientists who approach research questions differently, exploring complementary perspectives and integrating methodologies and analysis tools in creative ways. Fundamental research in multisource data acquisition and fusion has valuable implications for many fields including human-computer interaction, accessibility, health and well-being, and gaming.

Despite their importance and the extensive number of previous studies, these exchange processes are not well understood. This is because they occur over short scales in time and space, which makes it a challenge to resolve them with field measurements or numerical models. This comprehensive study will make use of state-of-the-art realistic ocean circulation models in combination with novel dynamical system tools to better understand and quantify these exchanges. The study area will extend from Gulf of Maine and the Mid-Atlantic Bight to the Gulf Stream and the Sargasso Sea, which is the spawning site for the American eel, a species of great scientific interest and economic value. This fish undertakes a remarkable spawning migration from freshwater habitats along the North American coast to the Sargasso Sea, and its larvae then have to return to coastal nursery habitats that predominantly occur along the eastern seaboard of North America. Since the larvae have only limited swimming ability, they have to navigate ocean circulation features to complete their migration. This study will also explore how they achieve this remarkable feat. The project will support three early-career scientists and will promote collaboration between physical oceanographers and biologists. The project will also contribute to K-12 educational programs, including class visits and field trips targeting mostly minority students. It will also continue efforts to bring science to the public through art and dance. <br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed study is to characterize and quantify, from a Lagrangian viewpoint, water mass exchanges and property fluxes between the continental shelf and the open ocean.  Several physical mechanisms are expected to influence the exchange processes in this region. These include topographic steering, wind forcing, instabilities and meanders of the shelfbreak jet, and Gulf Stream meanders and rings impinging on the shelf, each of which will be investigated and quantified. Specific regions and features of interest for the proposed study include the Mid-Atlantic Bight, the Gulf of Maine, the Slope Sea, the Gulf Stream and its extension, and the Sargasso Sea. A focused application of the proposed effort will be devoted to investigating the dispersal of eel larvae as an example of semi-Lagrangian, biologically relevant particles. The study will be based on a high-resolution regional model and a data-assimilative global model, and would compare Eulerian flux estimates with their Lagrangian counterparts and combine conventional statistical techniques with novel dynamical systems analysis. By its interdisciplinary nature, this project will have impacts across a variety of fields, including physical oceanography, marine biology, and dynamical systems. The PIs will also collaborate with colleagues at the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Participation in K-12 educational programs will include (1) efforts with established partner schools to introduce project results into their earth science module, and (2) class visits and field trips for East Boston High School (>80% minority students) students. PIs participating in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography will incorporate the study's findings into their graduate courses."

Consequently, the fundamental challenge in understanding and modeling the dynamics of both currents and surface gravity waves over shallow coral reefs is characterizing drag. This research is aimed at developing more accurate circulation and wave models for coral reefs that are essential for properly interpreting observations and modeling biochemical processes over reefs. A better understanding of the hydrodynamics is also essential for making accurate assessments of the impact of climate change on coral reefs. For example, the dependence of drag coefficients on water depth clearly has implications to the impact of sea level rise on coral reefs. This study will directly benefit ongoing research on the impact of ocean acidification on the barrier reefs of Palau (western tropical Pacific) and Dongsha (South China Sea) by providing a better physical context for interpreting biochemical observations. The project will inform the thesis work of two graduate students. <br/><br/>To advance the understanding of current and wave drag over coral reefs, this study addresses four sets of questions: 1) Do drag coefficients based on depth-average currents depend on water depth in a manner consistent with theory from open-channel flow and does this dependence account for some of the scatter in coral reef drag coefficients? 2) What is the relationship between surface gravity wave friction factors over coral reefs and orbital displacements and is it consistent with results from laboratory studies and existing theories? 3) Do wave-current interactions significantly enhance current drag and wave dissipation over coral reefs? 4) Are hydrodynamic roughness estimates for currents and surface waves similar and what is their relationship to physical roughness over coral reefs?  These four sets of questions will be addressed use existing observations of current profiles, pressures, and wave characteristics from three very different coral reef systems, Palau's barrier reef, Dongsha Atoll, and three platform reefs in the Red Sea. Spatial-average drag coefficients will be estimated by integrating the momentum balance across the reefs to account for spatial (and temporal) variations in water depth and determining the drag coefficient that minimizes the residual error in the momentum balance. Wave friction factors will be estimated by integrating the wave-energy balance across the reef and minimizing the residual error.  Since there are substantial spatial and temporal variations in water depth over coral reefs determining the drag coefficient dependence on water depth and providing a model for that dependence will be a significant advance in the understanding of coral reef hydrodynamics. The project will advance the understanding of wave-current interactions over coral reefs, a potentially important unresolved problem. Accounting for these factors influencing current and wave drag will allow accurate and consistent estimates of hydrodynamic roughness that can then be related to coral reef physical roughness."

Their diversity is staggering, with more than 500,000 species thought to exist. These minute wasps (mostly 1-2 mm in size) are numerically abundant and common in almost every habitat. The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control. The evolutionary events leading to this enormous diversity in morphology, biology and rates of diversification are poorly understood, leading to an artificial system of taxonomic classification. In this research project, researchers will use a diverse array of molecular, morphological and bioinformatics approaches to develop a solid understanding of the hierarchy of relationships across the entire group. These relationships will then be used to reclassify major groups to reflect common ancestry, to provide a framework for a web-accessible portal to manage and deliver information on their diverse biology, and to explore the evolutionary changes that have driven and shaped this enormous radiation of terrestrial insects.<br/><br/>The objectives of the research project are to 1) generate a robust molecular phylogeny of the Chalcidoidea using new data from transcriptomes and targeted DNA enrichment for over 400 species, 2) generate morphological data for over 200 fossils from Eocene and Cretaceous amber and combine these with a comprehensive morphological data set for extant taxa, 3) develop a revised classification of Chalcidoidea in book form through a series of workshops and worldwide collaborations, and 4) make available information on the taxonomy, biology and distribution of over 31,000 available names and information in over 40,000 references. The project will train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student and several undergraduates. To involve the wider scientific community, a worldwide group of biocontrol researchers and taxonomists will develop a new classification for Chalcidoidea. With groups of Research and Extension Specialists, the project will develop posters, fliers, specimen education kits, and other educational materials for use in the classroom and by extension specialists, agricultural advisors, master naturalists  and master gardeners, and the general public to develop a greater interest and understanding of this charismatic and and important group of insects."

The primary challenge for next-generation wireless networks is data capacity. Wireless data usage is doubling every year and network providers are projecting demand approaching one gigabit per user per day. This requires a 1000x increase in network capacity and 100x increase in worst-case data rates. Since availability of spectrum is limited, the higher capacity must be achieved by sharing existing spectrum among users and improving the performance of wireless systems. However, mobile applications also require low power consumption for longer battery life.  This project will investigate energy-efficient wireless circuits and systems for next-generation wireless networks that can provide gigabit per second links while operating under dense spectrum reuse. Developing such wireless systems has broad impact since improving the availability and speed of wireless links will expand existing applications as well as enable new applications that benefit economy and society. Synergy between education and research includes the creation of an inter-disciplinary course on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. This will allow students to identify and solve high-impact cross-domain problems in wireless networks. Outreach to high school students will create opportunities for early exposure to research environments, strengthening STEM pipelines.<br/><br/>Next-generation wireless networks will be based on MIMO systems for increased capacity in the context of spectrum scarcity and extreme densification. This project investigates MIMO circuits and architectures to achieve interference cancellation and enable next-generation, high-capacity wireless networks. The increasing speed of CMOS transistors and near-zero incremental cost of additional transistors allow the development of novel integrated architectures that leverage multiple transmit-receive elements to achieve higher performance and interferer tolerance. Ensuring the scalability of such architectures in terms of energy-efficiency and performance is critical as next-generation networks transition to larger number of elements and higher performance. This project will also study circuits and architectures for simplifying synchronization between elements in large-scale MIMO arrays. Using multiple elements to improve transceiver frontend performance results in relaxed analog-to-digital converter requirements, thereby enabling digital-intensive architectures that further support scalability."

Introduction of clean, but intermittent (sporadic) renewable generation introduces an unprecedented level of uncertainty in power system operation. At the same time, the society becomes more and more dependent on reliable supply of power and more sensitive to power outages. Maintaining power system security i.e. its ability to withstand most probable disturbances is an extremely challenging computational problem. Millions of scenarios have to be fast screened by operators and contingency plans prepared for the most dangerous of them. The key objective of this project is to develop a new generation of computational techniques that would allow fast identification of safe operating conditions that ensure system resiliency. This goal is achieved by targeted advancement and adaptation of the modern optimization and nonlinear analysis techniques to specific challenges faced by the power industry. The latter include but are not limited to: estimation of the reserve levels necessary for operation in the presence of intermittent wind power, identification of the most dangerous line failure scenarios, design of the most effective remedial action plans. The research activities will be tightly interwoven with educational and outreach efforts. Undergraduate and high-school students from underrepresented minorities will be engaged in the group research and educational activities. A set of simple power-grid inspired puzzles will be developed that will help explaining the kids and the broad audience the technical trade-offs and decisions that the power industry faces today. Finally, a new EdX introductory class on power systems with interactive problems will be developed to help in educating the future engineering workforce for power industry.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the research part of the project is based on the idea of constructing safe operation regions in parameter space where the solution is guaranteed to exist and satisfy operational constraints.

The project will explore possible representations of the mathematical problems appearing in the context of power system operations and security assessment. Specific problems that will be naturally addressed with the developed mathematical tools include computation of do-not-exceed limits, screening of N-1 and N-2 contingencies for AC power flow model, verification of the remedial actions, assessment of voltage stability margins in the presence of distributed reactive power control. A hierarchy of certificates will be constructed covering the conservativeness - complexity trade-off curve and their effectiveness demonstrated on standard IEEE testcases.

PG is unique to these microorganisms. It is essential for bacterial survival, and has a remarkably conserved structure throughout diverse bacterial groups. PG is not found in plants and animals, and given its essentialness and conservation in bacteria, it is an excellent target for antibiotics and innate immunity. Thus, PG is a focus of strategies for bacterial detection and control. Blocking the ability of bacteria to make a normal PG structure is generally lethal, yet in rare instances bacteria with novel PG have evolved naturally. This project uses the model animal-associated bacterium Vibrio fischeri to explore what happens when PG is experimentally forced to evolve. The results will shed light on the natural evolution of peptidoglycan, on the constraints of its function in bacteria, and on the limits of targeting PG as a means of controlling bacteria. Moreover, V. fischeri is a natural symbiotic bacterium that colonizes a Hawaiian squid, and PG is a key signaling molecule in this symbiosis. Thus, it offers the opportunity to examine how peptidoglycan structure affects the ability of host animal tissue to detect and respond to its resident bacteria (i.e., its microbiome). The broader impacts of this work for society include interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate student training, outreach to community K-12 schools, and contributions to a book on bacterial symbionts geared for use in the classroom. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate how unusual changes to bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan (PG) structure can evolve, and it will help define constraints on PG evolution. This project will examine how the tractable bacterium Vibrio fischeri can evolve new PG structure(s) using a strategy of iteratively blocking both normal and alternative pathways to PG biosynthesis. Viable mutants generating novel PG will be selected. Such mutants are likely to have distinctly non-wild-type properties of growth, cell shape, motility, etc.; however, rounds of growth in culture will lead to evolved strains that have accommodated the new PG. A combination of phenotypic testing and whole-genome resequencing will underpin a systems-type analysis of these evolved strains. The integrated analysis of genetic and phenotypic data will improve our understanding of how the cell wall is coordinated with other cellular components and processes, and it will lead to the discovery of new phenotypically important interconnections in bacterial cells. The results will inform our understanding of the natural evolution of PG and lead to a more predictive understanding of how PG might evolve in the future, e.g. under selective pressure from antibiotic use. V. fischeri is a symbiont in a model squid symbiosis, in which symbiont PG triggers developmental changes in the host. This study will provide insight into the relationship between PG structure and its function in this symbiosis, with broader implications for understanding innate immunity in higher organisms."

Are there ways that molecular systems work in bacteria that are similar to systems in higher organisms?  Or do bacteria have their own unique systems?  Do some bacteria have systems different even from other bacteria?  In this study, molecular systems in two bacteria, Caulobacter crescentus and Brevundimonas subvibrioides, will be investigated to determine how much they have in common with systems found in related bacteria or in higher organisms.  By investigating these systems, the extent to which evolution has reused the same blueprints to build complexity will be determined.  Part of this research will be performed by college undergraduates in the classroom, allowing a great many students, who normally would not have the opportunity, to conduct their own biological research study.  Additionally, high school students will be exposed to the wonders of the biological world as seen through the lens of a microscope.<br/><br/>Prokaryotic analogs of eukaryotic cellular systems have been found in a number of bacteria.  Yet, how much these systems are conserved from bacterium to bacterium, how similar these prokaryotic systems are to their eukaryotic versions, or how much they have been adapted to suit the unique needs of each organism is largely unknown.  This research will study the GcrA/CcrM epigenetic regulatory system and the DivK/CtrA cell cycle regulatory system, both of which are conserved throughout the Alphaproteobacterial clade.  These systems will be investigated in the bacterium Brevundimonas subvibrioides where they display important operational variation from the model organism Caulobacter crescentus, using modern genetic and cell biology techniques, including ChIP-Seq and single-molecule sequencing.  The comparisons of regulatory systems between related bacteria will aid in showing how systems evolve to better suit the needs of different organisms, what fundamental principles must be conserved between them, and assess just how translatable models can be across evolutionary distance.  Part of this research will be performed by undergraduates in an upper level class, providing the opportunity for many students to work on an original research project.

The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control.

Underlying all these applications are the dynamics which encompass a large number of modes, span vast spatiotemporal scales, and are connected to the intrinsic structural features (e.g. base-pairing) and some extrinsic factors (e.g. ligand binding). While equilibrium fluctuations in biomolecules such as RNA are inherent, it is the large-scale conformational transitions that play a dominant role in interfacial processes such as biomolecular recognition. Such dynamic properties are encoded in the physical free energy landscapes of biomolecules, the robust sampling of which can provide key thermodynamic and kinetic information on functional conformational ensembles of RNA molecules. The PI plans to look at conformational dynamics and interfacial interactions in small RNA molecules to enable their use for the above mentioned applications.<br/><br/>The research proposed is broadly concerned with two questions: (1) What physical variables are responsible for local and global conformational transitions in RNA molecules? and (2) How do these conformational transitions facilitate interfacial interactions of RNA with a diverse group of ligands (small molecules, short peptides, and globular proteins)? To gain a holistic view of the dynamics and interactions, the modeling and simulation effort will be integrated with spectroscopic (nucleic magnetic resonance) and imaging (electron cryo-microscopy) data. Understanding the details of how biomolecules undergo large-scale structural changes to elicit function is an unsolved problem. It is known that biomolecules are flexible and understanding their dynamics may provide insights into their function. Though, it is challenging to characterize such dynamic motions because no single computational or experimental technique can resolve motions at all spatiotemporal scales. The proposed computational approaches use physical free-energy landscapes in a reduced set of coordinates (while maintaining the all atom representation) as opposed to all degrees-of-freedom. The combination of computational and experimental techniques could establish new approaches to study these dynamics at a wide spectrum of time and length scales.<br/><br/>The educational plan will bring molecular theories, numerical algorithms, and visualization tools to a broad spectrum of STEM students and educators. It could impact and meet the Next Generation Science Standards and broaden participation in engineering and biophysics, through a broader educational initiative devoted to impart ""visuospatial"" thinking as a key skill via workshops on a freely-available software tool that will be further developed and disseminated via training of a wide spectrum of STEM population (students, teachers, and faculty). The students will travel to regional and national conferences, and will be exposed to international mentoring and multicultural experiences through partnerships with flagship engineering schools in India."

In current power grids, on-load tap-changing (OLTC) electromagnetic transformers, and step-voltage regulators have been commonly used for voltage conversion and control.  However, the tap-changing mechanisms used in OLTC transformers and step-voltage regulators are typically a mechanical mechanism or an electromechanical mechanism with a slow response and can only adjust the voltage ratio of the transformer or regulator in discrete steps.  Therefore, OLTC transformers and step-voltage regulators cannot meet the requirement for flexible, continuous, and fast-acting voltage conversion or control for future smart power grids.  The current alternative is the solid-state transformer (SST).  However, SSTs are currently still limited by voltage and power ratings of the solid-state devices and available circuit topologies.  Moreover, when compared to traditional electromagnetic transformers, SSTs would require more complicated and expensive thermal management and may have a shorter life expectancy.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will explore and prove a novel concept for a magnetoelectric transformer with a continuous and quickly adjustable voltage ratio for flexible, fast-acting voltage conversion and control to help secure the electricity supply, accommodate more renewable energy integration, and reduce the cost of electricity delivery.  In addition, the project team will build a thriving, diversified electric power and energy program through the integration of graduate and undergraduate research and teaching with K-12 outreach.  The program will provide a unique platform for training a new generation of young professionals to accommodate the changing environment and meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of the U.S. power and energy industry.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to develop a complete framework for designing, prototyping, modeling, controlling, operating, and demonstrating a novel adjustable-voltage-ratio (AVR) magnetoelectric transformer for flexible, continuous, and fast-acting voltage conversion and control of power grids.  The new capabilities of the proposed concept will be achieved through the development of: (1) a new voltage-controlled magnetoelectric device with an adjustable permeability to control the magnetic flux in the transformer, (2) a new transformer configuration for the integration of the flux control devices, and (3) new models and methods for controlling the voltage ratio of the transformer by regulating the magnetic flux using the new flux control devices in the transformer.  This project will provide an innovative and transformative solution for overcoming the existing limitations of existing voltage conversion and control devices used in power grids.  The physical and operating principles to be established and the models and design framework to be created for the new AVR transformer will build a solid theoretical foundation for future development and application of the proposed concept in power grids.  Once the proposed concept is proven by this project, further development and deployment of the concept will require new advancements in different disciplines, such as electrical engineering, material science and engineering, system and control engineering, and mechanical engineering, thus stimulating the creation of new interdisciplinary research.  The findings of this project will impact the control and operation of the future power grids, and will contribute to the creation of a smart power grid to provide better electric energy security, efficiency, and sustainability."

The processes of interest are related to perturbations that propagate upward from the lower atmosphere as well as to solar radiation and particle inputs from above.

In fact, stability assessment for a power system is a single nonlinear dynamic problem from the system point of view. However, a major technical gap lies in the current lack of fast, accurate stability analysis tools for complex, interconnected, nonlinear systems like power systems. This project aims at reducing that gap by establishing a new methodology for power system stability analysis and control based on understanding, decoupling and control of nonlinear modal dynamics. The outcomes of the project are expected to create broad impacts on both the power industry and research community. Fundamental theories established with the proposed new methodology can be generalized for other large-scale dynamic systems. The project will educate students at various levels in comprehending modal dynamics and nonlinearities inherent in interconnected power systems and train next-generation scientists and engineers to bring more nonlinear thinking to researching, designing and operating the future smart grid accommodating more renewable energy.<br/><br/>The research goals of the project include: (1) acquiring an in-depth understanding in nonlinear modal dynamics of an interconnected power system that are associated with invariant manifolds of the system state, (2) establishing a new approach for improving power system stability by nonlinear modal decoupling and control, and (3) boiling the new approach down to simple recipes such as practical tools for nonlinear modal analysis and stability monitoring of power systems. More specifically, the project will extend the concept of linear normal modes in small-signal stability analysis to nonlinear normal modes of power systems for global stability analysis, establish a theoretical foundation for natural decoupling and controlled decoupling of nonlinear normal modes based on the normal form method to structurally decompose the mathematical model of a power system, and propose innovative online stability assessment and control algorithms based on tracking and control of modal energy with nonlinear normal modes. This new methodology could be transformative to power system stability areas since the idea of understanding the nonlinear modes with power systems has not received enough attention in those areas and there is significant simplicity with stability analysis focusing on one or few modes compared to the original high-dimensional system model. Thus, the research of this project may point to a new avenue for faster-than-real-time stability assessment and control complementing the traditional computer simulation based approach."

OMZs constitute the largest pool of methane in the ocean water column, and also serve as sites where anaerobic microbes convert the essential element nitrogen from a form that can be used by organisms to a gaseous form (N2) that can be lost from the ocean.  Recent studies, predominantly in freshwater environments, have discovered novel bacteria that link methane consumption to pathways of nitrogen loss.  These researchers have recently shown that such bacteria also occur in OMZs.  However, the contributions of these bacteria to ocean methane and nitrogen flux remain unknown.  Here, the researchers will use a combination of genomics and biochemical measurements to characterize the metabolic potential and diversity of these bacteria in OMZs and to quantify their contribution to methane and nitrogen transformations.  Meeting this goal is critical for constraining bulk fluxes of these chemicals in the open ocean and for predictive models of climate change, notably given the importance of methane as a potent greenhouse gas and the prediction that OMZs will expand with global warming.  This project is also committed to enhancing knowledge of marine microbiology in the public arena and educational communities.  The investigators will incorporate results and concepts from this research into instructional modules for use in the Summer Workshop in Marine Science (SWiMS) at Georgia Tech (https://swimsgatech.wordpress.com/), an annual workshop to train middle and high school educators in marine science using lectures and lab exercises. This project will also involve training of undergraduate students, a postdoc, and local high school teachers through the Georgia Tech GIFT Program.  Through the combined research and educational activities, this research will determine how low-oxygen conditions in the ocean regulate pelagic microbial diversity and methane cycling, as well as inform, engage, and excite scientific and general audiences about marine microbiology and biogeochemistry.  <br/><br/>This research focuses specifically on bacteria conducting nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo).  This process has been described in bacteria of the NC10 division, in which a dismutation reaction generates both N2 and O2 gas, with the O2 used for intra-aerobic methane oxidation.  Although NC10 bacteria have been described primarily from nitrite-rich freshwater and marine sediments, recent evidence indicates that NC10 are also present in anoxic OMZs.  Given that OMZs contain substantial pools of the n-damo substrates nitrite and methane, it is hypothesized that OMZs harbor an anaerobic methane cycle coupled to nitrogen loss, and that this coupling is mediated by n-damo NC10 bacteria that occur as ubiquitous components in diverse OMZs.  To test this hypothesis, the researchers will 1) quantify the contribution of n-damo to OMZ methane oxidation, N2 production, and oxygen production rates, 2) characterize the diversity and ecophysiology of OMZ NC10 isolates through enrichments and single-cell genomics, and 3) survey the abundance, diversity, and activity of NC10 bacteria across distinct OMZ systems."

Another property of matter that allows data storage is ferroelectric polarization. This research explores how materials that are both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic respond to intense terahertz-frequency electric fields. The goal is to establish the physics of the materials interaction with the terahertz electric field. One terahertz frequency is more than one hundred times faster than your computer processor speed. Thus, this research potentially enables much faster data writing and storage functionality compared with the technologies available today. This project also aims to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers and to broaden the participation of women and under-represented minorities in sciences. The planned activities enhance the Tulane Science Scholar Program, whose goal is to attract high school students with exceptional promise in science and mathematics into engineering disciplines. The participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering is promoted through summer undergraduate student research with participants recruited from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in New Orleans on paid summer assistantships. The participation of women in sciences is promoted by the GIST (Girls in STEM at Tulane) program that provides middle-school girls with the opportunity to meet and work with women role models in science. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:  This project targets a new frontier in technologically advanced ferroelectrics and multiferroics by focusing on ferroelectric and magnetoelectric dynamics driven by intense terahertz pulses, where both spin and lattice are resonantly excited.  The goal is to discover the new physics that emerges when the coupled spin and lattice motion is coherently driven in the very large amplitude regime. It is hypothesized that the terahertz-driven dynamic ferroelectric and magnetic responses can approach in magnitude the responses induced by static electric fields and allow domain manipulation. Terahertz pulses with peak electric field exceeding 100 kV/cm are used to coherently excite the large-amplitude ionic motion along the ferroelectric phonon coordinates. The spin dynamics is excited via the magneto-electric coupling of spin to the lattice motion.  The response of the order parameters is probed using terahertz and optical probe pulses.  This work aims to create new knowledge of the nonequilibrium response of matter to intense terahertz pulses and to provide guidance for the design of future terahertz-frequency magneto-electric and data storage devices."

PG is unique to these microorganisms. It is essential for bacterial survival, and has a remarkably conserved structure throughout diverse bacterial groups.  PG is not found in plants and animals, and given its essentialness and conservation in bacteria, it is an excellent target for antibiotics and innate immunity.  Thus, PG is a focus of strategies for bacterial detection and control.  Blocking the ability of bacteria to make a normal PG structure is generally lethal, yet in rare instances bacteria with novel PG have evolved naturally.  This project uses the model animal-associated bacterium Vibrio fischeri to explore what happens when PG is experimentally forced to evolve.  The results will shed light on the natural evolution of peptidoglycan, on the constraints of its function in bacteria, and on the limits of targeting PG as a means of controlling bacteria.  Moreover, V. fischeri is a natural symbiotic bacterium that colonizes a Hawaiian squid, and PG is a key signaling molecule in this symbiosis. Thus, it offers the opportunity to examine how peptidoglycan structure affects the ability of host animal tissue to detect and respond to its resident bacteria (i.e., its microbiome).  The broader impacts of this work for society include interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate student training, outreach to community K-12 schools, and contributions to a book on bacterial symbionts geared for use in the classroom. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate how unusual changes to bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan (PG) structure can evolve, and it will help define constraints on PG evolution.  This project will examine how the tractable bacterium Vibrio fischeri can evolve new PG structure(s) using a strategy of iteratively blocking both normal and alternative pathways to PG biosynthesis. Viable mutants generating novel PG will be selected. Such mutants are likely to have distinctly non-wild-type properties of growth, cell shape, motility, etc.; however, rounds of growth in culture will lead to evolved strains that have accommodated the new PG.  A combination of phenotypic testing and whole-genome resequencing will underpin a systems-type analysis of these evolved strains.  The integrated analysis of genetic and phenotypic data will improve our understanding of how the cell wall is coordinated with other cellular components and processes, and it will lead to the discovery of new phenotypically important interconnections in bacterial cells.  The results will inform our understanding of the natural evolution of PG and lead to a more predictive understanding of how PG might evolve in the future, e.g. under selective pressure from antibiotic use.   V. fischeri is a symbiont in a model squid symbiosis, in which symbiont PG triggers developmental changes in the host.  This study will provide insight into the relationship between PG structure and its function in this symbiosis, with broader implications for understanding innate immunity in higher organisms."

The largest MWP, MWP-1A, occurred 14,600-14,300 years ago with ~14 m of global-mean sea-level rise.

Results from this research will provide important data on whether the ice sheet failure caused rapid jumps in sea level. Determining if the ice sheet separation caused a MWP will provide insight into the evolution of North Atlantic climate and its relationship to meltwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean where much of the ice sheet separation meltwater would be routed. These findings will also have implications for development of instability in the Greenland ice sheet as it has an ice saddle similar to the one previously seen in the Cordilleran-Laurentide.

In virtually all applications dealing with networks and large data sets, one wishes to extract sub-groups of data points that are similar, i.e., communities. While community detection techniques are expanding daily with practical successes, relatively less attention has been paid to the fundamental limits, and consequently to where current algorithms stand. By establishing the fundamental limits of community detection, this project offers a novel take on community detection algorithms, and expands information theory in a prominent area where it can naturally flourish. The project will work with real data sets from social and biological networks. In particular, it develops a new initiative to extract communities in Hi-C genomic data, contributing to unveil the 3D folding structure of DNA.<br/><br/>The project will focus in particular on the stochastic block model, a canonical model for community detection. The investigator's recent work leverages information theory to provide the first necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in the stochastic block model, and an efficient algorithm achieving the limit. This opens the door to a new perspective on community detection, which is developed in this project by casting community detection as unorthodox error-control coding problems. In this context, new types of f-divergences are expected to play a key role, analogous to the Kullback-Leibler divergence in Shannon's channel coding theorem, while other weaker recovery requirements may rely on unorthodox broadcasting problems, graph entropic inequalities, and information-estimation problems. This makes the study of community detection a rich area connecting information theory, machine learning and networks; less focused on ergodic results; and more interlaced with graph theory and spectral analysis. In particular, this project will show how these problems, as well as more general low-rank approximation problems, can be studied under the novel and unifying theme of graphical channels."

Cloud computing service providers commonly implement key-value stores over large scale distributed data storage systems. At the heart of key-value store implementations in distributed storage systems, there are carefully crafted algorithms that expose a consistent, current view of the stored data to a user who reads the data.  The main purpose of this project is to undertake a formal study of the storage costs incurred in distributed storage systems which aspire to present a consistent, current view of the stored data. The project has the long-term potential to aid the development of new data storage techniques that can benefit key-value store implementations by reducing their storage cost and energy consumption.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/><br/>An important requirement of a distributed data storage system is fault tolerance, that is, the data must be accessible even if the system components fail. In applications of distributed storage to distributed computing and implementation of key-value stores, the following property known as consistency is also critical: when the data is being constantly updated, a user that reads from the system should obtain the latest version of the data. Algorithms that ensure consistency and fault tolerance in storage systems have been extensively studied in distributed systems theory and practice. The goal of this project is to obtain, for the first time, an information theoretic understanding of the storage costs incurred in consistent, fault-tolerant distributed storage systems.<br/><br/>Building on preliminary work by the investigator, the project will develop and study several new information theoretic formulations inspired by distributed systems theory and practice. The proposed formulations naturally expose trade-offs between the degrees of redundancy and consistency, and other physical parameters of storage systems. New coding schemes and information theoretic converses for the proposed formulations will be developed using tools from algebra, combinatorics and network information theory. The project will also pursue the development of new bounds for network coding, which naturally apply to the newly proposed formulations and to other families of codes including locally repairable codes and regenerating codes. The project will likewise develop an education plan that eyes the long term goal of developing interdisciplinary researchers and engineers who are trained in information theory, coding theory, and the theory and design of distributed systems."

This project investigates whether the early embryo uses extracellular microvesicles (exosomes), as tissue-specifying signaling agents. Exosomes are a recently discovered class of small, membrane-bound particles secreted from cells. It is now known that exosomes carry proteins involved with cell-cell recognition and signaling on their surfaces, and also that they contain microRNAs and mRNAs with the potential to alter gene expression patterns of cells receiving them. The ability of exosomes secreted from one cell type to ""reprogram"" other cells at a distance has been demonstrated in tissue culture, but whether this exciting property is utilized during normal embryonic development is not known. The current project investigates this possibility by pursuing the observation that blood formation requires exosomes. The goals of this research are to investigate the cell biology of exosomal exchange in during embryogenesis in frogs.  The project will address whether qualitative or quantitative changes in the exosomal proteins occur during early development? Which tissues secrete exosomes? Are specific tissues in the early frog embryo targeted by exosomes; if so, how do those tissues respond? Can altering the secretion or specificity of exosome uptake alter embryonic blood development? Answering these questions will advance the nascent, rapidly growing field of exosomal cell biology, and expand our understanding of the repertoire of signaling mechanisms used by embryonic cells early in normal development. Many aspects of this research present excellent hands-on opportunities for students and trainees at all levels, and thus can serve as a critical starting point or advancement step for developing careers in biology or biomedicine.<br/><br/>This project explores the novel hypothesis that the early Xenopus embryo uses extracellular microvesicles, specifically exosomes, for embryonic tissue patterning. Exosomes have recently been recognized as potent conveyors of membrane-associated signaling ligands and receptors, functional microRNAs and mRNAs, but most such demonstrations have been in limited tissue-culture situations. Recent work demonstrated that an extracellular compartment in the intact early Xenopus embryo is highly enriched with exosomes. Mass spectroscopic proteomic analysis confirms an abundance of exosomal markers, and electron microscopy confirms an abundance of particles in the size range typical of exosomes. Embryos reared deprived of microvesicles develop with a characteristic set of morphological defects, particularly a profound reduction in hematopoiesis, suggesting a fundamental role for exosome-dependent signaling during tissue specification steps of early development. This significant cell-biological activity has not previously been explored in a vertebrate embryo, so the goals of this project are to characterize exosomes, including the time course of their appearance, their cargo and the surface proteins that potentially define their tissue target specificity. This information will be used to develop probes and reagents to investigate their tissue origins and potential tissue targets."

Chemicals are used as defensive weapons, to signal danger, to mark resources for later foraging or for avoidance, and to identify mates of the correct species and assess their quality. The social insects take this chemically-oriented lifestyle to an extreme. The sophisticated division of labor in social insect colonies requires exquisite regulation of individual behaviors, and chemical pheromones are crucial for organizing work within the colony. Despite these important and diverse roles, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how pheromones originate and evolve. Here, Tsutsui and Fisher will combine genetic manipulations, pheromone analyses, and behavioral tests to clarify how various forces of natural selection shape chemical communication in a social insect. This research will be performed using the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) as a model system. This ant is a globally widespread invader, is considered one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world, and is a significant agricultural and structural pest. The research of Tsutsui and Fisher is likely to reveal pheromonal and behavioral processes that can be targeted in the development of new control techniques, thus contributing to greater ecological resilience, enhanced food quality and security, and reduced degradation of soil and water by conventional insecticides. <br/><br/>Self/non-self recognition systems have played a central role in many of the major evolutionary transitions. Because components of these recognition systems are often co-opted from existing systems, they can experience conflicting forms of selection after acquiring their new functions. The societies of eusocial insects are an ideal system in which to study the evolutionary trade-offs associated with the evolution of self/non-self recognition systems. In many eusocial insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are used to distinguish colonymates (self) from non-colony members (non-self). However, CHCs have also retained their original function as barriers to desiccation. These two distinct roles of CHCs - as both desiccation barriers and recognition pheromones - are expected to produce different forms of selection, as the optimal molecular proporties for the two functions are quite different. Tsutsui and Fisher will combine functional genomics, chemical ecology, and behavioral ecology to test the overarching hypothesis that evolutionary trade-offs shape the recognition system of social insects. The results of this research will illuminate how genetic and chemical changes lead to changes in individual behavior and, in turn, alter the structure of complex societies."

Design of such systems heavily relies on insights and experiences of engineers as principled design methodologies that can cope with the complexity of these systems are lacking. As a result, extensive testing and fine-tuning is required to ensure that the final product satisfies the design objectives. As a principled alternative, this project proposes to use modularity for managing complexity during both the design- and the life-cycles of cyber-physical systems. The objective is to develop the scientific foundation and associated algorithmic tools for the design of modular cyber-physical control systems. If successful, in the long-run this research will lead to a ""plug and play"" integration framework for CPSs supported by automated design tools, where one can replace a subsystem with another one or perform upgrades to subsystems while maintaining operational correctness guarantees. Results from this research will be relevant to many application domains, including next generation air vehicles, automotive systems and robotics. Its potential transformative impact will be on the way CPSs in these domains are designed and operated. Translation to the economy will proceed by actively seeking and engaging industrial partners. This research effort will be complemented by an education plan where interdisciplinary research and thinking in the area of CPS will be fostered among undergraduate and graduate students to prepare the next generation of CPS researchers and practitioners.<br/><br/>To be specific, the project will develop theoretical foundations and associated algorithmic tools for distributed synthesis of provably correct control protocols that give rise to compositional design principles for cyber-physical control systems. In particular, algorithms for decompositions of system requirements at the discrete/logic level and of the system states at the continuous/system level will be developed. The main idea is a novel separation between external and internal factors affecting each subsystem that allows internal interactions required for the successful operation of a subsystem to be computed explicitly. These internal interactions, namely interface rules, are captured in terms of assumption and guarantee pairs that are used for solving local synthesis problems to obtain local controllers in a distributed manner, while maintaining global correctness guarantees when these controllers are deployed simultaneously. The modularity-performance trade-off space will be explored by introducing proper partial orders on these interface rules and by tuning the complexity of the interface rules according to these order relations. Tools from control theory (decentralized and robust control, model reduction, discrete event systems) and formal methods (temporal logics, compositional verification, distributed reactive synthesis) will be brought to bear to address these problems."

The project will support the education and training of students at multiple levels, including undergraduate students from diverse and under-served populations. Additionally, the project will be led by three female investigators, serving as role models for women in science.<br/><br/>This research will examine the relationships among plant genetic and epigenetic diversity, root-associated fungi, and plant structural and physiological trait variation (morphology, nutrient content, salt tolerance) across an inundation gradient in the intertidal foundation plant species Spartina alterniflora. Specifically, the project combines genomic approaches with field surveys and experiments in the greenhouse and the field to address the following questions: (1) How are plant genetic and epigenetic variation, root-associated fungi, and plant structural and physiological traits related across an intertidal gradient?; (2) Does the presence and strain of root-associated fungi affect plant structural and physiological trait response to abiotic variables, and is this effect mediated by epigenetic change?; and (3) How are candidate genes or gene networks involved in the structural and physiological response to the biotic and abiotic environment, and are they epigenetically regulated? The work takes advantage of a novel reduced representation DNA sequencing epiGBS protocol with bisulphite treated DNA to measure genetic and epigenetic diversity in S. alterniflora. Additionally, next generation sequencing of fungal isolates will allow for documentation of the role of dark septate endophytes in the response of this critical foundation species to its dynamic salt marsh habitat."

Chemicals are used as defensive weapons, to signal danger, to mark resources for later foraging or for avoidance, and to identify mates of the correct species and assess their quality. The social insects take this chemically-oriented lifestyle to an extreme. The sophisticated division of labor in social insect colonies requires exquisite regulation of individual behaviors, and chemical pheromones are crucial for organizing work within the colony. Despite these important and diverse roles, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how pheromones originate and evolve. In this project genetic manipulations, pheromone analyses, and behavioral tests will be combined to clarify how various forces of natural selection shape chemical communication in a social insect. This research will be performed using the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) as a model system. This ant, a globally widespread invader, is considered one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world, and is a significant agricultural and structural pest. The research is likely to reveal pheromonal and behavioral processes that can be targeted in the development of new control techniques, thus contributing to greater ecological resilience, enhanced food quality and security, and reduced degradation of soil and water by conventional insecticides. <br/><br/>Self/non-self recognition systems have played a central role in many of the major evolutionary transitions. Because components of these recognition systems are often co-opted from existing systems, they can experience conflicting forms of selection after acquiring their new functions. The societies of eusocial insects are an ideal system in which to study the evolutionary trade-offs associated with the evolution of self/non-self recognition systems. In many eusocial insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are used to distinguish colony mates (self) from non-colony members (non-self). However, CHCs have also retained their original function as barriers to desiccation. These two distinct roles of CHCs - as both desiccation barriers and recognition pheromones - are expected to produce different forms of selection, as the optimal molecular properties for the two functions are quite different. In this project functional genomics, chemical ecology, and behavioral ecology will be combined to test the overarching hypothesis that evolutionary trade-offs shape the recognition system of social insects. The results of this research will illuminate how genetic and chemical changes lead to changes in individual behavior and, in turn, alter the structure of complex societies."

The relative activity of different microbial community members can determine the extent of greenhouse gas capture, recycling of nutrients and food production by the ocean.  Currently, there is a critical gap in our ability to quantify the balance between these processes.  A major roadblock in our ability to understand the microbial players is our inability to grow even the most abundant organisms in the lab and study their physiology.  With the recent cultivation of three bacteria common to the ocean, the possibility exists to make major advances in our understanding of their contribution to ocean processes and how they might change in the future.  This project will characterize these three bacteria in culture to develop tools to determine their activities in the field.  Because these bacteria are common in low oxygen environments, this work is particularly well poised to address how microbial communities respond to oxygen-depleted waters.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in an important research area through collaboration with the University of Washington Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program, the Program for Climate change and the University of Washington's Educational Outreach Program. Results will be presented at national and international meetings and through publication. All data will be freely available through the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office (BCO-DMO).<br/><br/>The balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy determines the size of the ocean's carbon sink and the flux of material and energy available to food chains. Despite efforts to identify the contributions of major bacterial and archaeal lineages to carbon fluxes, little is known about the environmental conditions that determine the underlying metabolisms controlling carbon flux. Members of the SUP05 clade of sulfur oxidizing gamma-proteobacteria are abundant in the dark ocean and can dominate expanding suboxic and anoxic zones, where they have the potential to both produce and consume organic matter. The recent cultivation of 3 representatives from the SUP05 clade has revealed striking metabolic diversity within the clade. These isolates represent an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the effects of carbon limitation, energy limitation and oxygen tension on the production and consumption of organic matter by a critical group of marine bacteria. The work proposed here would 1) determine the balance between autotrophic carbon fixation and heterotrophic organic matter assimilation in diverse cultured representatives under varying environmental conditions 2) determine the kinetics of reactions fueling autotrophy 3) characterize biomarkers along gradients of autotrophic and heterotrophic production induced by varying environmental conditions and 4) detect these molecular markers in the field along with cell abundances to determine the contribution of autotrophy, heterotrophy, sulfur oxidation and denitrification to SUP05 metabolism in a field site that transects an oxygen minimum zone in the North Pacific Ocean. This project will advance understanding of SUP05, a biological driver of elemental cycling in the mesopelagic, one of the largest habitats on earth and one that is experiencing large climate driven changes, including expansion of oxygen minimum zones."

SPUD can connect to a laptop (to provide a large secondary or primary screen) and to a tablet/phone (to create a mobile workstation when coupled with a portable keyboard).  SPUD eliminates the screen size versus portability tradeoff.  With SPUD, users can have the large computer screen they need wherever they want.  This means that those who rely on large computer screens and frequently work away from a dedicated desk now have the tool they need to maximize their productivity.  Example target customers include auditors, business development professionals, tax consultants, management consultants, and students.  There are an estimated 10 million professionals who work away from their desk frequently and rely on large computer screens.  These target customers know that large computer screens increase productivity as much as 50%, as demonstrated through many studies.  This means that these mobile professionals can get more computer related work done in a day compared to their peers who work on smaller screens.  Additionally, a 24-inch computer screen has been proven to increase productivity 50% over even 18 inch monitors, as shown in a Wall Street Journal study.  Additional customers/uses include government (military, first responders, disaster relief) and consumer (gamers, campers, parents) applications.  <br/><br/>SPUD consists of novel mechanics and optics coupled to a collapsible screen and portable projector to achieve the collapsible computer screen.  To achieve this outcome, the team has and will continue to engage in mechanics research to create an interface that optimizes screen quality and usability for the target market applications. Current mechanics research for this project has focused on heavily modifying well-known existing technologies and future research will likely focus on the development of completely novel technologies.  Previous optics development for this project, likewise, has focused on the implementation of existing lensing systems for this new application.  Current optics development for this project has consisted of the development of a novel catadioptric system that greatly shortens the throw ratio of traditional projectors while minimizing weight contribution.  Future optics development will employ free-form optics.  The project has large potential contribution as further development of a novel display type will have broad societal and science impacts.  With a collapsible screen, there are many use cases that will improve quality of life for different customer segments and even potentially help save lives in first responder and military applications. The science impact will result in improved functionality and manufacturability for similar optical based devices while also furthering the development of freeform optics."

Understanding how different genes evolve and acquire new functions is a fundamental biological problem with many computational methods developed for studying how gene families evolve and change over time in different organisms. These existing methods assume that the gene is the basic unit of evolution and that evolutionary processes such as gene duplication, gene loss, and horizontal gene transfer act on entire genes, rather than on parts of genes. It is well known that most genes consist of one or more ""protein domains,"" well-characterized functional units that can be independently lost or gained during evolution, and that domain shuffling is one of the primary mechanisms through which genes evolve and gain new functions. Proper inference and accounting of domain-level evolutionary events is therefore crucial to understanding how genes evolve and function. The proposed research will lay the methodological and algorithmic foundations for a novel computational framework that addresses this critical problem.  The new computational framework and algorithms will enable more powerful comparative genomic techniques for understanding gene function and biology, and may also contribute to improvements in human health and agriculture. The proposed research will shape future computational advances in the study of domain, gene, and genome evolution for many years to come, and will also spur the development of more comprehensive computational models in other areas of molecular evolution. The algorithms developed as part of this research will be implemented into a user-friendly software package and made freely available. The project will directly involve two graduate and up to ten undergraduate students, introduce several high-school students to computer science, bioinformatics, and research, and provide training to many high-school science teachers on the role of computer science in biology. <br/><br/>This project will lead to the development of the first ""three-tree"" model of domain evolution that explicitly captures the interdependence of domain-, gene-, and species-level evolution. The proposed three-tree computational framework is based on phylogenetic reconciliation, where the goal is to find a most parsimonious joint reconciliation of the given gene trees with the species tree and of the given domain trees with the gene trees. The resulting optimization problems will be solved using various algorithmic techniques including dynamic programming, branch and bound, enumeration and sampling, and local search. The framework will decouple domain-level events from gene-level events and provide a fine-grained view of gene family and domain family evolution that is both more accurate and much easier to interpret. Specific aims include: (i) development of the three-tree computational framework and corresponding algorithms, (ii) enhancing inference accuracy by accounting for multiple optima and domain tree errors, and (iii) extension of the three-tree framework to microbial gene families by allowing for horizontal gene transfer."

The Power Wall is transforming all levels of the system stack, including the parallel architecture landscape. Communication power, as induced by data movement and the orchestration thereof, along with storage power, dominates computation power. As the degree of concurrency increases, communication power becomes even more prominent due to more frequent data transfers. At the same time, emerging memory technologies are not mature enough to keep up with the corresponding capacity, bandwidth, and performance requirements within a tight power budget. An amnesic processor, can minimize, if not eliminate, the power and performance overhead associated with data storage, retrieval, and communication, thus, operate more energy efficiently. The limited storage of the amnesic machine represents the short-term memory, which lacks long-term memory by construction.<br/><br/>When compared to its classic counterparts, an amnesic machine can facilitate more compute engines to occupy the area once devoted to (long-term) memory, which can further be harnessed for recomputation. Recomputation can transparently convert workloads to become more compute intensive such that they can make a better use of classic architectures optimized for performance, as opposed to energy efficiency. This project intends to unlock the energy efficiency premise of amnesic machines. To this end, the PI proposes to explore compiler and microarchitecture support to decide when to replace remote loads with re-computation. The research has three major thrusts: (i) at compiler time, integer linear programming based optimization will be performed to generate a probabilistic energy-minimal re-computation schedule; (ii) runtime controller will be designed to decide when to re-compute based on the information the compiler provides; and (iii) memory hierarchy will also be explored to maximize energy efficiency. Interaction with emerging technologies and reliability issues will also be considered.

Deviations from this simple behavior due to interactions between electrons or additional degrees of freedom of the individual electrons are at the heart of some of the most fundamentally important electronic phenomena.  Examples range from superconductivity to magnetism and include material behavior of broad technological relevance.  This CAREER project studies electronic materials that realize new types of unconventional behavior by combining two typically disparate phenomena: strong coupling of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of individual electrons and low connectivity (frustrated) crystalline lattices that enhance interactions between electrons.  The project experimentally explores this combination via synthesis, characterization, and analysis of such materials towards new interacting states to forge the building blocks of the next generation of electronics.  The role of materials synthesis in this research dovetails with its educational efforts to improve the status of education in crystal growth in the United States.  This involves both crystal growth training at the principal investigator's institution for a wide range of students and researchers and exchange activities with internationally recognized centers for crystal growth.  These educational efforts also include K-12 collaborations with science enrichment activities that feature direct interaction between elementary school students and educators with the principle investigator and the research team.

Probing the interplay of spin-orbit and frustration is expected to elucidate the manner in which these effects act in concert; this activity aims at developing this understanding towards the ultimate goal of a new paradigm for interacting electronic states.  New topological, magnetic, and electronic properties of these systems are evaluated as drivers for functionalities in the next generation of quantum electronics.  The methods used are materials synthesis, electrical and magnetic characterization, and collaborative efforts using optical spectroscopy, theory, neutron scattering, and microwave techniques.  The combination of materials science and physics in both the research and educational aspects of the project aims to overcome the cultural barrier that is perceived to exist between these fields in the United States.  The research itself is enabled by the interplay of these two fields.  The education goals are targeted activities in crystal growth education and training at the principle investigator's institution for a wide range of students and researchers and more broadly to the greater scientific community through science outreach projects with elementary school students and international exchanges.

In particular, in the ocean, phosphorous is a key limiting nutrient, controlling levels of primary productivity across large swaths of the ocean. Removal of phosphorous occurs largely via formation of stable apatite minerals in ocean sediments. However, average ocean conditions generally inhibit the formation of apatite, thus the abundance of apatite minerals in marine sediments is a mystery. This research aims to determine the mechanisms of apatite formation in the ocean to answer this century-old question. Evaluating these mechanisms will greatly advance current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean. A more detailed understanding of phosphorous cycling can be applied across the disciplines of ocean science, and because of the importance of phosphorous as a nutrient and an element with a variety of interactions with other elements, it will be applicable to a variety of other research questions. The researchers are dedicated to promoting diversity in ocean science and plan to include undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the study. They will also mentor a postdoc and communicate their science to the public and K-12 teachers via a blog entitled ?Britannica Blog?, the Atlanta Science Festival, a rock show, and educational material, the latter two to be developed as part of this work.  <br/><br/>Marine phosphorous burial via authigenic stable apatite formation in sediments is a major pathway for phosphorous removal in the ocean. However, in most marine environments, under natural conditions, this process is kinetically inhibited. It has been a mystery for more than a century as to how it is therefore possible for apatite to be oversaturated in large areas of marine sediments. A possible mechanism that could explain 95% of the apatite burial flux is that apatite minerals are precipitated as fine-grained particles from exogenous polyphosphate intermediates. Exogenous polyphosphates have been understudied, despite this possible importance as a mechanism for phosphorous removal. As a consequence this research could revolutionize current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean for the major aim is to make a thorough and detailed study of the mechanisms behind marine apatite formation, focusing on the role of exogenous polyphosphate particles. Phosphorous is an element with widespread importance in ocean sciences, and more clearly understanding its burial will have applications across the disciplines."

Rare events can have significant consequences, and improved understanding of their occurrence can aid in the design or management of such systems. The characterization of the likelihood of rare events is essential in all systems in which stochasticity plays an important role, as it allows us to take advantage of such events if they are desirable and to avoid them if they present a threat. The outcomes of this project will contribute to the understanding of rare events in complex systems, in particular, fluid dynamics and related geophysical systems. Further applications include the characterization of extreme events in the context of epidemics, population dynamics, and molecular biology. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop efficient computational methods to characterize the most likely way rare events occur in complex stochastic systems and to estimate the tails of their probability distributions. For this purpose, the investigators will develop efficient algorithms to compute the so-called ""instantons"" that are minimizers of the action functional that large deviation theory associates with the stochastic differential equation describing the system's evolution. Numerical methods to calculate instantons will first be developed in the context of turbulence (in particular Burgers equation, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), Navier-Stokes equations, and the surface-quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation) driven by diffusive processes. Then the investigators will extend the methods to stochastic equations that are driven by non-Markovian noise (fractional Brownian motion) or jump-processes, which play an important role in physics, biology, and chemistry. Finally, the investigators will calculate fluctuations around the instantons to get finer estimates of their probability of occurrence via prefactor calculations."

However, such integration of multiple chips not only exacerbates fabrication, manufacturing, and assembly, but also lowers the yield of end products; this increases the possibility for failure to be induced at various stages of manufacturing processes. As a result, the role of extensive testing to filter any defective or damaged chips out for an emerging next generation chips is becoming increasingly significant. However, the testing of complex next generation chips poses a number of challenges. First, as size of the structures to be tested is reducing, they are more and more vulnerable to damage during testing. In addition to this, the distance between adjacent signal pads is reducing, and thus testing platforms should be able to correspond this drift. With the increasing complexity of integrated chips, the heat generated during testing is rapidly increasing adding further challenges to the testing methodology. Therefore, there is a critical need for a novel platform which can alleviate some current and possible future hurdles allowing electronic design, test and packaging companies to continue device and system level scaling for future generations. With the use of modern electronics spanning from wearables and smart cars to high performance computing and industries, the ability to keep pushing the envelope to get smarter and more efficient electronics would have far reaching effects.<br/><br/>The proposed testing platform, is a critical component in the testing of chips and should be able to overcome the challenges mentioned earlier. This team has successfully demonstrated microfluidic cooling on interposer level and have benchmarked the performance compared to the air cooled system. Similarly, the team has carried out extensive research on design, fabrication, and characterization of mechanically flexible interconnects which have high out-of-plane compliance. The proposed advanced testing platform featuring mechanically flexible interconnects and microfluidic cooling system has the potential to revolutionize next generation testing applications by providing efficient thermal management during testing and allowing the probing of dense and smaller structures with minimal damage; this would allow test cost reduction while preventing overheating during test However, the assessment of the proposed technology and the inspection of the readiness for commercialization will be conducted through this program. Also, through the NSF I-Corps program, the team will conduct interviews with various commercial entities in the semiconductor and electronics industry to better understand possible current and future bottlenecks in testing and to investigate how to best position of technologies for this space. With integrated ICs being an integral part of majority of the consumer electronics market, the proposed technology will aid in providing more and more powerful devices to the general public. this technology will also reduce the number of chips damaged during the testing phase and will allow higher yields and lower overheads allowing manufacturers to operate at a competitive price point giving consumers good value for money."

The essential ingredients of this long-term carbon cycle, which regulates the availability of carbon for the biosphere and the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, are release of CO2 from volcanoes and return of CO2 return to the mantle along with old oceanic crust at subduction zones. In geochemistry, our ability to understand how a compound like CO2 will behave in such environments depends on identifying what mineral or fluid carries the carbon at each stage. Some information about this can be gained from natural observations and some from experiments, but there are key stages of the carbon cycle where calculation is the best tool at our disposal. This project will carry out a detailed computational study of the structure, thermodynamics, and stability of carbonate minerals under terrestrial mantle conditions, in order to constrain their role in storing and transporting carbon during subduction and melting processes. The approach combines tools from computational mineral physics, materials science, and classical thermodynamics to make predictions about complex solid solution phases at elevated pressure and finite temperature. Such a comprehensive approach is highly unusual in Earth science.<br/><br/>Building on their success in predicting a new dense structure of CaMg(CO3)2 dolomite that is more stable than any observed experimentally, and in computing the phase diagram of end-member dolomite composition, the team has four goals for this project: (1) to determine the kinetics of transition among the pure dolomite phases; (2) to determine the influence of Fe2+ in the dolomite structure on phase stability, thermodynamic properties, and phase relations in Ca(Mg,Fe)(CO3)2 system; (3) to compute phase diagrams governing decarbonation in the CaO-MgO-FeO-SiO2-CO2 system; and (4) optimistically, to compute phase diagrams governing redox exchange between C and Fe in an extended system including reduced carbon and ferric iron. Their approach begins with prediction of stable crystal structures from first principles using a combination of evolutionary crystallography and density-functional theory. Thermodynamics of stable structures are characterized by a static equation of state and a fully anharmonic treatment of temperature effects and vibrational entropy via a highly efficient molecular dynamics approach. Solid solutions and configurational entropy are treated through detailed consideration of ordering phenomena and Boltzmann weighting of populated configurations. Finally, multicomponent phase diagrams are computed from the chemical potentials of components in relevant phases. This proposal will fund the stipend and computational resources required by a female graduate student being trained in an unusual combination of experimental and computational mineral physics approaches. Their workflow for computing the stability of novel carbonate phases relative to free CO2 has the possibility to connect to novel materials approaches to carbon sequestration."

The research will identify user abilities based on their behaviors, leading to mobile user interfaces that are more accessible to diverse user communities (e.g., veterans), in a variety of environments (including cases of situation-induced impairments).  In particular, the PI will explore the challenges of data-driven adaptive interface layouts based on user behavior and visual attention in mobile computing when the user is actually mobile.  The work will involve student researchers from under-represented groups currently advised by the PI, and will be evaluated by different populations engaged in realistic but varied activities.  This will allow the PI to release software and research findings that enable people to design interfaces that properly adapt to the abilities of members of the target communities.  The research ties directly into an educational plan to develop a student response tool for lecture-style user interface courses, that allows students to create wireframe interfaces, to design typefaces, and to draw visualizations during class on touchscreen and mobile devices, which can be displayed on the room screen for discussion and peer feedback.  The tool will be iteratively refined in a user interface course with a diverse student population, and deployed in a course at the PI's institution outside of computer science as well as in user interface courses at other universities.<br/><br/> User interfaces on mobile devices are not one-size-fits-all, nor should they be.  Users' abilities may differ, or the situational context of the environment can introduce new challenges.  By their very nature, mobile devices are used in many different environments and with different postures.  For example, users may hold their tablet in both hands with the screen in landscape orientation to read in bed, swiping to different pages occasionally; at other times, they may be pushing a stroller while gripping their phone with one hand to navigate a map application.  Because manufacturers know this, smartphones and tablets, unlike desktop computers, can accept touch input and sense both motion and orientation, and data from these interactions can be captured by websites and apps to identify specific user abilities and context.  Over time, user interaction data collected at scale will enable personalization of the interface, say by reshaping touch targets to compensate for a user's habit of typically tapping to the right of a target, by relocating important buttons to more accessible locations on the screen, or by determining ideal text size by noting the zoom level a user often applies.  Thus, the work will comprise three research objectives.  The first objective is to investigate how to passively capture touch and motion data from mobile devices, to compute metrics representing user habits and mistakes as they perform touch interactions, and to determine the environmental context of the user from motion and touch behaviors.  The second objective is to incorporate orientation and touch sensors to train an eye tracking model using the front-facing camera to detect the user's attention.  The third objective, informed by findings from the first two, is to improve the usability and accessibility of existing interfaces, e.g., by adjusting the hittable area of targets, the text size, and interface layout."

Statistical semantic parsing is a promising paradigm for addressing this demand.  The key obstacle in building statistical semantic parsers is obtaining adequate training data.  This CAREER project aims to develop a new interactive framework for building a semantic parser, where the system, acting like a foreign speaker of English, asks users to paraphrase utterances that the computer already understands into ones that the computer doesn't. The framework opens up intriguing applications in education.  One such application is a bidirectional tutoring system, in which the system poses questions to the student.  The student must both answer and paraphrase the question, thereby both practicing the course material and providing training data to the system.  Natural language is a universal entry point, which can increase engagement and promote diversity. High-quality semantic parsers can drastically improve the way humans interact with computers.  In the longer term, this work can also have a significant impact on the way natural language processing systems are built.  Currently, the prevailing paradigm is very much a train-and-deploy one, whereas there are many more opportunities for improvement and personalization if deployed systems were to learn on-the-fly.<br/><br/>This project develops a new interactive framework for building a semantic parser, which aims to obtain complete coverage in a given domain.  The key idea is for the system to choose logical forms, generate probe utterances that capture their semantics, and ask users to paraphrase them into natural input utterances.  In the process, the system learns about linguistic variation and novel high-level concepts.  The data is then used to train a paraphrasing-based semantic parsing model.  Existing paraphrasing models are either transformation-based, which excel at capturing structural regularities in language or are vector-based, which excel at capturing soft similarity.  The project develops novel models to capture both. The framework developed in this project improves the state-of-the-art of natural language processing and machine learning in three ways.  First, the framework departs from the classic paradigm of gathering a dataset and learning a model; instead, an interactive system interleaves the two steps.  Second, the framework learns high-level concepts, which is crucial for natural language understanding, since words often represent complex concepts.  Finally, it resolves a classic tension between the rigidity of logical representations and the flexibility of continuous representations by capturing both in a unified model."

A good understanding of how to organize, process, and transform these data into actionable knowledge is crucial. This research aims to unlock the potential of these data through the exploration of new fundamental research directions and approaches in machine learning. Targeting patients identified as high-risk by through computational data-driven models could reduce the burden of disease in a cost-effective manner. While machine learning opportunities in medicine continue to grow, there have been relatively few successes regarding translation to practice. Clinicians still base the bulk of their daily decisions on relatively small amounts of patient-specific data. The technical contributions made here will enable the meaningful use of complex medical data. Beyond the long-term societal impact, this work will provide valuable student training through research projects related to the proposed objectives. Targeted outreach activities that focus on the societal impacts of computational research will attract a diverse set of graduate students to the field. In addition, this work will help lay the foundation for a new project-based course focusing on applications of machine learning in clinical care. As the field continues to grow, such courses will become critical for equipping the next generation of students with the required tools and insights. Finally, critical inter-departmental collaborations between computer science and engineering and medicine will grow as a result of this work, leading to the enrichment of both fields. <br/><br/>The primary research objective of this proposal is to increase the utility of machine learning in clinical care, through the exploration of new fundamental research directions and approaches in ML. For data-driven predictive models to become widely and safely adopted in clinical care, there remain several key research challenges that the ML community must address: poor adaptability to complex unexpected changes in patient populations and clinical protocols, insufficient intelligibility of accurate but uninterpretable models, and absence of actionability, with accuracy overcoming actionability. The PI proposes the development of new transfer learning techniques for learning robust and adaptable models in a wide range of scenarios. Experiments and evaluations with large-scale clinical datasets will offer insight into how these data change over time, and a better understanding of when and how models should adapt.   Clinical decision models and software are seldom incorporated into practice because they are either black-box or the output (while accurate) does not offer any insight into how to act. One way to increase the intelligibility of models is to focus on building clinically meaningful features. Another way to increase intelligibility is through sparsity. The PI will investigate feature engineering/selection methods for learning useful abstractions that automatically leverage expert knowledge and for learning models based on actionable features. The PI will explore structured regularization techniques to select modifiable features. To gain a better understanding of how different actions affect patient risk, the PI will address the limitations of causal inference in the context of high-dimensional observational datasets. This research will yield methods for producing clinically meaningful inputs, and methods for jointly optimizing sparsity and actionability.  The proposed work will yield novel techniques for extracting and building adaptable, intelligible, and actionable models from patient data. An emphasis on adaptable solutions will ensure that such techniques can be safely adopted long-term. The study of techniques for dealing with the inherent heterogeneity of the data (e.g., different patient populations from across multiple sites) will not only increase the utility of the data but will lead to more general advances in the field of transfer learning. A focus on intelligibility - a quality that is often overlooked by the machine learning community - promises to increase the utility of such models, since clinicians are more likely to adopt a model they can check and understand. Prioritizing actionable models will yield new strategies for causal analysis in high-dimensional observational settings. This, in turn, will enable the generation of new hypotheses regarding causal relationships in clinical medicine."

Once validated the technique will be broadly applicable to all sedimentary environments including oceans, rivers/streams, wetlands and lakes.  Understanding porewater flow dynamics is important to understanding ocean and other aquatic system chemical budgets, microbial ecology and global heat flow. <br/><br/>This proposal hypothesizes that the short-lived radium isotope Ra 224 may serve as an effective tracer of porewater flows in deep ocean systems, regardless of the type or composition of seepages, because its sources and sinks can be uniquely constrained.

As a result heat fluxes and gradients in magnesium and other cations affected by high-temperature water/rock interactions can be used to independently validate the porewater flows measured by Ra 224."

The outcomes of this project will contribute to the understanding of rare events in complex systems, in particular, fluid dynamics and related geophysical systems. Further applications include the characterization of extreme events in the context of epidemics, population dynamics, and molecular biology. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop efficient computational methods to characterize the most likely way rare events occur in complex stochastic systems and to estimate the tails of their probability distributions.

Numerical methods to calculate instantons will first be developed in the context of turbulence (in particular Burgers equation, magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD), Navier-Stokes equations, and the surface-quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation) driven by diffusive processes. Then the investigators will extend the methods to stochastic equations that are driven by non-Markovian noise (fractional Brownian motion) or jump-processes, which play an important role in physics, biology, and chemistry. Finally, the investigators will calculate fluctuations around the instantons to get finer estimates of their probability of occurrence via prefactor calculations."

A particular focus is to make the best in international biodiversity research count in international biodiversity assessment and policy research needs. Ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide are currently undergoing rapid change. The projected redistribution of species and their associated ecological functions and services crosses national boundaries, and to reliably quantify impacts and help prioritize actions to mitigate them will require international research collaborations. Two important research and science-policy platforms, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and Future Earth have recently been formed to address the magnitude and potential effects of these ongoing transformations.

This research focuses on understanding how cells adopt a specific cell fate as they traverse through the embryo. The cells within the early embryo turn on specific genes, in part, in response to chemical cues they receive from their neighboring cells. This project will discover how genes are controlled by a group of regulatory RNAs. These regulatory RNAs control the level of gene expressions of many genes in several cell types to ensure proper development. Thus, this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of animal development. The project includes education activities that are synergistic to the proposed research project. The first educational activity involves an outreach program at the Delaware Children's Museum where the PI and her students develop a mobile microscope for young children to conduct hands-on, exploratory activities. The second educational activity is to enhance the knowledge base of future early childhood teachers by instilling confidence in science teaching, and by supporting science curriculum development. Inexpensive smartphone microscope platforms are placed in the hands of student teachers to foster future use in their own classrooms. This project is integrated into research training of undergraduate and graduate students and courses taught at the University of Delaware. The proposed educational activities incorporate the PI's expertise in development biology, microscopy, and ongoing research collaborations.<br/>  <br/>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved regulatory RNA molecules that control a myriad of biological processes, including development. In early development, cell specification and pattern formation are controlled by cross-regulation of gene regulatory networks (GRN) and signaling pathways. Signaling morphogen gradients are critical regulators that need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that the precise organization of the embryo is achieved. This project addresses the overarching hypothesis that miRNAs perform this critical regulatory function. Its goal is to understand how miRNAs integrate GRNs and signaling pathways to drive development. To accomplish this goal, this study uses the sea urchin to study complex developmental processes that are shared by a wide range of organisms. The sea urchin has an exceptionally well-studied GRN and most of its miRNA families consist of a single species, which makes it amenable to unique, powerful functional analysis. To determine the mechanisms by which miRNAs control cell fate specification and directed cell movement during early embryogenesis, the PI will determine regulatory mechanisms of a highly conserved microRNA, miR-31, in the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) lineage. This project examines how miR-31 coordinately suppresses PMC GRN components and cross-regulates signaling pathways to drive PMC development, using proteomic, transcriptomic, imaging, embryo transplantation, and molecular approaches. Overall, this study will advance the field of miRNA research and contribute to the fundamental understanding of early developmental processes."

Historically the synergy between analytic number theory and the combinatorial/algebraic world of partitions and q-series has been extremely fruitful, starting with the collaboration of Hardy and Ramanujan. Throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first,  we have seen each area enrich the other. For example, mid-twentieth century workers like Dyson and Atkin found fruitful interactions between these two areas, and the potential for further interactions along these lines by the  participants in this conference is significant and tantalizing.

This competition for faster performance has, understandably, neglected predictability of our database management systems. However, as database systems have become more complex, their erratic and unpredictable performance has become a major challenge facing database users and administrators alike. With the increasing reliance of mission-critical business applications on their databases, maintaining high levels of database performance (i.e., service level guarantees) is now more important than ever. Cloud users find it challenging to provision and tune their database instances, due to the highly non-linear and unpredictable nature of today's databases. Even for deployed databases, performance tuning has become somewhat of a black art, rendering qualified database administrators a scare resource.<br/><br/>In this project, we restore the missing virtue of predictability in the design of database systems. First, we quantify the major sources of uncertainty in a database in a principled manner. Then, by rethinking the traditional design of a database system, we architect a new generation of databases that treat predictability as a first class-citizen in their various stages of query processing, from physical design to memory management and query scheduling. Moreover, to accommodate existing database systems (which are not predictable by design), we provide effective tools and methodologies for predicting their performance more accurately.

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. <br/>I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.<br/><br/>Dartmouth's I-Corps Site provides intensive entrepreneurial training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine, and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship and Technology Transfer (OETT). <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers, and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration, pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation, or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists in a completely different area. <br/><br/>The objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop. After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network, local angel investors, and other organizations.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The broader impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%, respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50% women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs semi-annually."

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics.  Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time in at least a dozen years that the workshop -- which attracts participants from across the US as well as internationally -- will meet on the east coast, home to many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics.  Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years - have two professional development panels on topics such as starting a tenure track job, forming collaborations, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. The organizers of the workshop, which has an international reputation for providing a supportive atmosphere for junior researchers, are committed to continuing to facilitate a supportive, inclusive, vertically integrated environment.<br/><br/>Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas.  One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms.  Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions.  Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.<br/><br/>Website:http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/"

When the assembly process is driven by thermodynamics and is conducted under near-equilibrium conditions, nanoparticles can self-assemble spontaneously to form materials that have proven useful in a variety of applications.  However, the restriction to near-equilibrium conditions limits the new structures that can be formed and limits their growth rates.  To address this issue, this project will use time-varying magnetic fields to direct the assembly of nanoparticles under conditions far from equilibrium and not subject to thermodynamic constraints of near-equilibrium processes.  The project will develop computational algorithms that can be used by scientists and engineers to explore potential routes to new nanoparticle-based structures. The project will also use results of the research to develop several novel educational tools, including simulations of fluid flow with nanoparticles and smartphone apps that are educational games to illustrate basic concepts of fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that out-of-equilibrium self-assembly processes, which are driven by non-conservative or time-varying forces, are not thermodynamically constrained. The project is motivated by recent experiments that used time-varying magnetic fields to form crystals from suspensions of paramagnetic colloids at unprecedented growth rates. The objective of the proposed research is to test this hypothesis with computational models and to develop a theoretical framework to describe the kinetics, stability and control of such out-of-equilibrium processes. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics underpinned by large-scale stochastic simulations will be used to identify, investigate, and optimize out-of-equilibrium pathways for the growth of nanoparticle crystals. .  The project will develop accelerated simulations of assembly kinetics, simulate assembly driven by time-varying interactions among nanoparticles, and develop theory to predict phase transitions owing to nanoparticle interactions."

DNA in a cell's nucleus is packaged into a complex structure called chromatin, which contains a variety of proteins. These chromatin proteins determine if the information stored in a particular portion of the DNA is accessible (genes are ""turned on"") or inaccessible (genes are ""turned off"") as part of a process called gene regulation. The members of the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) protein family function in chromatin structure in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Specifically, this project will examine the role of HP1 proteins in gene regulation and the molecular mechanisms mediating this role. It is essential for an organism's survival and health to ""turn on"" the correct genes at the correct time and place. The results from this study will improve scientific understanding of why this process sometimes goes wrong and how it might be corrected. In addition to furthering knowledge about chromatin, this study will serve to train minority students in chromatin biology through a summer internship program and support the development of a classroom undergraduate research experience (CURE) specifically targeted to minorities and non-traditional students transferring from community colleges to four-year institutions. <br/><br/>This project will use transcriptome analysis of Drosophila lines lacking HP1 proteins and chromatin state information from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to evaluate the impact of HP1 proteins on gene expression. This analysis will reveal the contexts in which HP1 proteins function as transcriptional activators or repressors, and how cooperative effects differ from individual effect. Analysis of the impact of HP1 recruitment on nucleosome positioning, chromatin composition, and RNA polymerase dynamics will determine how HP1 proteins impact gene regulation. These experiments will identify the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the effects of HP1 proteins on gene expression. Finally, biochemical analysis of the transcription-start-site-(TSS)-associated HP1 complexes will determine why single HP1 complexes are formed at some TSSs, while others recruit multi-HP1 complexes. The findings will provide the foundation for understanding how this important class of proteins is recruited to their target sites and carries out diverse functions in chromatin structure and gene regulation.  By utilizing a multi-faceted approach, this study will link the well-established role of HP1 proteins in heterochromatin formation with their role in gene regulation.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and by the NSF EPSCoR Program."

However, there exists a paradox, where often the more severe a person's impairment, the less able they are to operate these very machines which might improve their quality of life. Here robotics technologies have the potential to transform the field of human health and rehabilitation: by turning the machine into a robot, that can operate itself autonomously and share the control burden. It will be crucial that these robots adapt to the human user's unique preferences and abilities, and how both change over time is crucial for achieving widespread adoption and acceptance, and especially if attached to a human's body to provide physical assistance. <br/><br/>There has been limited study of robot learning from non-experts, and the domain of motor-impaired teachers is even more challenging: their control signals are noisy (due to artifacts in the motor signal) and sparse (if providing motor commands is more effort), and filtered through an interface. Rather than treat these constraints as limitations, the proposed work hypothesizes that such constraints become advantageous for machine learning algorithms that exploit unique characteristics (like problem-space sparsity) of control and feedback signals from motor-impaired humans. The work develops multiple novel machine learning algorithmic techniques, (1) that reason explicitly about the control interface and how it interacts with the full robot control space; (2) that derive information about the human's control patterns and task requirements, from variability in the human's teleoperation commands; and (3) which include the design of adaptation cues informed by reward- and example-based feedback from motor-impaired teachers. The proposed work also performs subject studies with motor-impaired end-users operating multiple robotic platforms, both to explore this problem space and assess the functionality and user acceptance of the contributed algorithmic techniques."

The approach transfers the latest knowledge from network science to LCI database development. An LCI database represents the interdependence of unit processes and environmental interventions. The ensemble of such interdependence characterizes the structure of the underlying technology network (or LCI network). If sufficient enough, observed LCI data, although limited, can be used to extract structural features of the underlying LCI network. Such structural features, in turn, can be used to predict the structure of the unknown area of the LCI network, which is equivalent to estimating the unknown data in the LCI database. This research will first create a framework for modeling and analyzing LCI networks. This framework will then be used to develop and validate a variety of link prediction models to estimate missing data for LCI databases. Finally the validated link prediction models will be used to evaluate LCI data quality and predict LCI data for emerging technologies for testbed databases selected in consultation with stakeholders."

The goal of SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen both the physical understanding and predictive capabilities for these phenomena. Since it?s inception in 1996, SHINE has grown into a vibrant community of researchers spanning a wide range of disciplines, but still primarily focused on understanding solar processes and their influence on the inner heliospheric environment.  A key factor in the success of the SHINE program is the annual summer workshop, which is highly valued for its uniqueness in style and effectiveness of communication. The workshops bring together a large number of active researchers in the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities, including, not least, a strong and growing student and post-doc population.  Typical numbers for students and postdocs attending the workshops are 65-75, which constitutes about 35% of the entire workshop population. The SHINE workshop provides students a unique opportunity to present their research, learn from experts in the field and network in a relaxed and collegial atmosphere.  The main purpose of this award is to continue the support for students and postdocs to attend the annual workshops.  <br/><br/>SHINE research focuses in particular upon: (i) the connection between events and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the heliosphere; (ii) the origin and evolution of the solar wind; (iii) the nature of turbulence in the interplanetary medium; and (iv) the production and transport of solar energetic particles from the Sun through the heliosphere.  The annual SHINE workshops provide un-matched opportunities for active discussions and new collaborative projects around these topics."

By reverting hypoxia via epigenetic programming by re-oxygenation of tumorigenic cells (cells in hypoxia are 2-3 times less receptive to radiation and subsequent therapies than normal cells), the hypoxia-adaptive pathways can be destabilized to significantly suppress tumor progression opening the door for improved chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Thus an effective oxygen delivery system could significantly impact the efficacy of cancer therapy. Further, the ability to steer the particles by ultrasound to enhance localization and the ability to burst the bubbles to deliver cargo (oxygen and drug) by an ultrasound trigger provides a significant opportunity in improving targeting and delivery efficacy. Based on preliminary discussions, this I-Corps team expects that pharmaceutical companies will be receptive to furthering the proposed oxygen delivery concepts to develop a solution that is practical to impact not only cancer treatment but other diseases as well. Delivery of oxygen can impact a range of biomedical applications that can impact treatment in addition to cancer cure, examples include oxygenation of stem cells trapped in biomaterials, oxygenation of islets cells to treat diabetes, and oxygenation to treat ischemic heart tissues and other hypoxic cardiovascular diseases.<br/><br/>This team's key innovation is the ability to precisely steer nanobubbles for enhanced localization to effect therapy. An example is in epigenetic programming to revert hypoxia with minimal side effects and to enhance efficacy of subsequent therapies. The team expects to add a new dimension to the well-established clinical utility of ultrasound-assisted cancer diagnosis and to significantly benefit a range of therapeutic drug deliveries by precision ultrasound guiding and focused triggered release of cargo (oxygen and or drugs). Initial discussions with several customers are in progress on the proposed technology. The I-Corps program will enable the team to identify promising market opportunities, understand the most important needs of customers and strategic partners, and determine the optimal path for commercialization. This team is hopeful that an outcome of our customer discovery will be a new startup business and an SBIR Phase I proposal or licensing of the technology to a commercial partner."

The core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.<br/><br/>NMSU and Arrowhead have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator.

Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding applications and private investment solicitations. <br/><br/>Aggie I-Corps is having a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of Aggie I-Corps participants.

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. <br/><br/>UNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries. The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.<br/><br/>UNH's existing commercialization infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative process include:<br/>   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; <br/>   (2) A 10-week LLP course with exposure to the entire business model canvas; <br/>   (3) A demo day to showcase ideas; and <br/>   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary conversations. <br/>Promising projects are connected to business mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry of ideas.<br/><br/>Implementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic and social potential. <br/><br/>To assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site to the national innovation network.<br/><br/>The UNH Site impacts transcend exposure to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture of commercialization on campus.

Determining the processes by which one species becomes two is crucial to understanding patterns of biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. Speciation, the process of new species formation, occurs when barriers to reproduction evolve between populations or groups. However, studying speciation for flowering plant species with multiple chromosome sets - a condition known as polyploidy - has proven difficult. Most flowering plants are polyploid, and groups with different chromosome numbers cannot easily interbreed, yet they are rarely recognized as different species. Reasons for this range from the physical similarity between plants with different chromosome numbers, to whether they have adapted to different environments. Although creosote bush with different chromosome complements inhabit ecologically distinct areas, they sometimes co-occur suggesting additional reproductive barriers are responsible for divergence. By combining DNA analyses, greenhouse experiments, and field investigations, this project will provide unprecedented insight into the early stages of speciation for groups of plants with different chromosome complements.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to bring polyploid species under the larger umbrella of speciation research by elucidating the biological significance of genome duplication to plant diversification. Polyploidy, especially autopolyploidy, where genome duplication occurs within a lineage rather than through hybridization, poses many challenges for evolutionary biologists, including understanding the relative importance of ecological and intrinsic genetic processes to diversification. Population-level analyses are critical for evaluating how plant-animal interactions and ecological adaptation influence divergence among ""intraspecific"" groups differing in chromosome complement, and whether diversification of polyploid species is similar to model diploid species. Moreover, this project, focused on the keystone plant species Larrea tridentata and its native pollinators in sensitive North American desert biomes, will help characterize the novel molecular diversity and ecological interactions comprising the cryptic biodiversity of polyploid species. The taxonomic recognition of populations differing in chromosome complement could significantly alter biodiversity estimates for certain parts of the world, especially temperate biomes, impacting our understanding of major ecological patterns."

The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is emerging as a foundational experimental research platform across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research in very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. <br/><br/>GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues:<br/><br/>1.	Science Issues: We cannot currently fully understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks.<br/><br/>2.	Societal Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience.<br/><br/>3.	 Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers exist to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.<br/><br/>GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication.   It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who among their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources.   It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community.  GENI is already being used as an instrument for research.   This proposal supports the development and use of the research instrument."

By adding significant amounts of water to mantle rocks, serpentinization causes a decrease in rock density and mechanical strength. As a result serpentinization is believed to play a major role in the formation and breakup of continents, seafloor spreading and subduction.  The hydration of mantle rocks impacts the global geochemical cycles of volatiles, most notably water and carbon dioxide, with strong implications for Earth's climate, mantle melting in volcanic arcs and the seismicity of subduction zones. Serpentinization has operated throughout most of Earth's history and has, via the production of hydrogen, created geochemical conditions capable of supporting microbial life in extreme subsurface environments. Despite its key role in a number of global geological processes, the most basic relations between chemical mass transfer during serpentinization and associated changes in rock volume have remained poorly quantified. This project is designed to improve our understanding of these processes.<br/>	<br/>The overall objective of this research is to link changes in fluid composition and mineralogy to concomitant changes in volume as a function of time and temperature using a combination of hydrothermal laboratory experiments, mineral and fluid analysis, X-ray microtomography (-CT), and geochemical modeling. In particular this project will resolve whether serpentinization can be regarded as an isochemical or an isovolumetric process, a long-standing and strongly debated question in serpentinization research. The results of this study will have important ramifications for our understanding of the geochemistry, emplacement and deformation of serpentinite in a wide range of geological settings."

These materials are formed by vertically stacking atomic layers such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenide (e.g. molybdenum disulfide) layers. The forces between these layers are relatively weak.  However, they can dramatically change the properties of the system and induce phenomena that are absent in individual layers. By stacking or epitaxially growing different atomic layers on one another, one may design and fabricate artificial materials with unprecedented optical, electronic, and vibrational properties that cannot be achieved in natural crystals. Raman spectroscopy, which is a direct, noninvasive, and sensitive optical probe, is used to explore the interlayer coupling, the interface effect, and the interaction between vibrations and charge carriers in these heterostructures. This research provides crucial guidance in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices using stacked atomic layers. The research activities have a powerful impact on the undergraduate students at the University of Northern Iowa. The principal investigator integrates the research topics into two existing courses. Undergraduates at all levels, including freshman students, are encouraged to participate. The principal investigator also uses departmental contacts with area high schools and collaborates with Physics Education faculty colleagues and the director of the Classic Upward Bound program to involve teachers and students at regional high schools.

This study offers a simple method of characterizing Moire pattern features without using scanning tunneling microscopy; (ii) Explore the electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of complex multilayer van der Waals heterostructures and the indirect-direct gap transition in MoS2 bilayers intercalated with different middle layer materials. This research provides crucial guidance in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices using stacked van der Waals multilayers; (iii) Study van der Waals heterostructures that involve Dirac materials. In particular, the research team investigates the change in the electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene after it is placed or sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride. This study probes the change in the electronic and vibrational properties of graphene at the hetero-interface; (iv) Probe the interaction between carriers and interlayer phonons in twisted bilayer graphene devices with a dual-gate.

This project will analyze three-dimensional images of the distribution of melt in experimentally produced partially molten rocks and simulate several physical properties of these samples. Results from this study will make it possible to link seismic and electromagnetic data with models of melt transport in the interior of the Earth, which ultimately helps understand how plate tectonics works and the link between mantle processes and volcanic activity.<br/><br/>This study will use synchrotron microtomography to image partially molten mantle rocks in three-dimensions.

Digital rock physics simulations will be performed to obtain permeability, electrical conductivity and elastic moduli of both hydrostatically annealed olivine + orthopyroxene-basaltic melt and sheared partially molten olivine rocks. Variation of melt content with distance in the sample will be analyzed to constrain the bulk viscosity of the sample. This project will quantify the effects of lithological partitioning due to the presence of orthopyroxene on melt distribution and show how deformation affects melt distribution, and induces permeability anisotropy."

Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation in nature is also useful for increasing crop yields and for the conservation of wild species. One such challenge faced by organisms at high latitudes is freezing temperatures. This research investigates the genetics of freezing tolerance in the mouse-eared cress, a relative of many crop species that has become a ""model"" organism for which many genetic tools have been developed. In earlier work, the researchers collected seeds of this species from Italy and Sweden and planted them in experimental gardens located in each country. They found that freezing tolerance is required to survive the long, cold winters in Sweden, whereas freezing tolerance reduces performance in Italy. This result exemplifies the concept of biological ""trade-offs""; adaptation to one environment often reduces performance elsewhere. This simple principle can explain why there are so many different species on earth, in that each species is adapted to a particular environment. The research investigates the genetic control of freezing tolerance and explores the mechanisms that contribute to the tradeoff in performance across environments. The genetic mechanisms identified in these studies may be useful tools for producing new crop varieties with increased yield in cold climates. In addition, the research team will perform outreach activities that advance scientific literacy and promote careers in science. Michigan State University scientists will contribute to a partnership between K-12 teachers and the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station to develop lesson plans that support Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for inquiry based learning.<br/><br/>The research employs cutting edge genetic technologies to address the mechanisms and adaptive value of freezing tolerance using three complementary approaches. First, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be further examined in the two original populations in Sweden and Italy using new lines manipulating freezing tolerance genes in otherwise homogeneous parental backgrounds. These lines will then be grown in controlled environment chambers and in the field to estimate the importance of freezing tolerance genes for genetic trade-offs in performance across environments. Second, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be investigated in <br/>four new populations from Scandinavia and Spain with dramatic differences in freezing tolerance. Third, this research will be expanded to an even broader scale, asking if the same genes for freezing tolerance found in these focal populations are found in other geographic regions. The techniques employed in part three are similar to those used to study the genetics of many human diseases. Taken together, these studies examine the genetic basis of freezing tolerance in a broad diversity of natural populations and assess the mechanisms of performance trade-offs for this important adaptive trait."

As the grid boxes are typically tens of kilometers wide or more it is not possible to represent individual clouds, or even cloud systems, in such models.  Instead the net effect of clouds and other small-scale processes on the larger scale atmospheric flow must be approximated through the use of parameterizations, and this representation is a key source of errors in weather forecasts and uncertainty in future climate change projections. Alternative methods of representing clouds and their interactions with large-scale atmospheric conditions are therefore desirable for forecasting the weather and providing decision support to stakeholders concerned with the impacts of climate variability and change.<br/><br/>This award supports the development and testing of  a novel atmospheric model, the global quasi-3D Multiscale Modeling Framework (Q3D MMF). The model is an extension of the Super-Parameterizaton (SP) scheme developed by the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes (CMMAP, see AGS-0425247), the Science and Technology Center (STC).  The SP MMF consists of a global atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) in which the parameterizations for cloud processes and other subgrid-scale processes in each grid column are replaced by a high-resolution cloud resolving model (CRM). CMMAP has already produced an SP version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, or SP-CAM for the SP version). But SP-CAM uses a two-dimensional (2D) CRM in which the domain is a vertical plane oriented in either the zonal (x-) or meridional (y-) direction and periodic boundary conditions in the x- or y-direction. These restrictions are imposed to reduce computational cost, and to relax them entirely would require a global CRM (GCRM) which is too computationally expensive for most purposes. <br/><br/>Alternatively, the Q3D MMF partially relaxes the conditions by using CRMs with domains that are narrow channels with only a few gridpoints in the cross-channel domain. The channels connect with their counterparts in neighboring cells of the GCM, thus avoiding periodic boundary conditions at either end of the channel. Moreover, each grid cell of the GCM has two such channel-shaped CRMs, oriented in the zonal and meridional direction, to allow for directional anisotropy due to surface topography and other factors.The zonal and meridional CRM channels thus extend around the globe without interruption and intersect each other at adjacent grid cells of the parent GCM. The channel models do not interact at the intersections, as that would result in unphysical behavior associated with a cross-shaped domain. The separate CRM channels communicate only with the GCM, receiving background information from the GCM and supplying the GCM with the outputs expected from standard grid column parameterizations found in conventional GCMs.  Work here is an extension of previous work at CMMAP, including the development of a simpler version in which the CRMs are embedded in a regional model over an idealized tropical domain.  Work under this award includes several tasks required to develop a global model from this prototype, including inclusion of topography and conversion from a periodic Cartesian domain to a realistic GCM domain.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts for the research community because it develops a new atmospheric model which is applicable to a range of research areas related to the impact of clouds on large-scale weather and climate phenomena.  To ensure accessibility to the broader research community, the Q3D MMF will be constructed using a version of CAM (the spectral element version) as the GCM component.  CAM is freely available, well supported and documented, and widely used, thereby maximizing accessibility.  In addition, CAM is the atmospheric component model of the Community Earth System Model, which is used for projections of future climate change that inform decision makers concerned with climate impacts on natural and human systems."

Based on PEF, a software-behavior-driven power management scheme is introduced to improve system power efficiency at runtime. The power management scheme applies power saving mechanisms including thread mapping and voltage and frequency scaling, driven by program characteristics based on the software power prediction of the target platform. PEF enables a quantitative measurement of the ratio of useful work done to resources utilized.

Carbon dioxide gas generated by power generation or industrial processes is a potential source of carbon for fuels and chemicals production.  However, carbon dioxide is not very reactive, and no viable technologies for its conversion into fuels and chemicals presently exist.  The goal of this product is to convert carbon dioxide and water to fuels and chemical using plasma-enhanced solar energy.  In the proposed process, solar energy heats the carbon dioxide gas to the high temperatures needed to increase its reactivity.  The heated gas is then converted into plasma, also known as an electrically charged gas, using electrical energy.   It is reasoned that the plasma state of the gas will enhance the rate of carbon dioxide conversion.  The process is potentially sustainable and has a low carbon footprint because it uses waste carbon dioxide and abundant solar energy, where electricity needed to generate the plasma is provided by solar photovoltaic cells.  The project will also develop instructional carts for demonstrating energy and sustainability topics inspired by this research to a broad audience that includes Hispanic K-12 students in the Lowell, Massachusetts area.  <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of a new process for synthesis of chemical and fuels from carbon dioxide and water using concentrated solar energy to drive the reaction thermochemistry and non-equilibrium plasma to enhance the chemical reaction kinetics.   Plasma-Enhanced Solar Energy (PESE) combines solar thermochemistry and plasma science principles.  The project will experimentally and computationally investigate PESE for carbon dioxide, water, and methane decomposition and reforming.  The research will test the hypothesis that the molecular excitation produced by free electrons in plasmas increases solar photon absorption leading to enhanced chemical reaction kinetics.  Towards this end, the proposed research will seek to understand non-equilibrium energy transport phenomena characteristic of free electron and photon systems, with particular focus on processes with comparable photon and electron energy fluxes.  To support the research plan, new reactor systems equipped with solar energy receivers and non-equilibrium electrical discharge capability to flowing gas will be developed and characterized.  Reactor experiments spanning the ratio of solar to electrical energy inputs will be performed at scalable process conditions.  New fluid flow and chemical kinetics models for non-equilibrium energy transport will be derived and experimentally validated.  The research outcomes seek to reveal the specific pathways of energy conversion during PESE processing and quantify the efficacy of plasma enhancement.  Additionally, the research outcomes are relevant to other fields where electron and photon transport have essential roles, such as laser materials processing, semiconductor manufacturing, and combustion enhancement.  The educational goal of the project is to engage students, from middle school to graduate level, on global energy sustainability topics.  To enable the proposed education program, interactive demonstration carts for the modular teaching and learning of energy engineering & sustainability will be developed and assessed."

Of particular interest is the question of the scale of coupling of the lower atmosphere, where phenomena such as thunderstorms exist, to the ionized layer near 100-120 km. The physics of lightning phenomenology within thunderstorm events are very complex and highly time-dependent with complex morphology characterizing the coupling of lightning bolts to the ionosphere with consequential significant temporal behavior of the ionized density of the lower ionosphere region.  These electrical discharges are initiated inside thunderstorms and are rooted in one of the main thundercloud charge layers. This award would study the physical processes underlying the particular transient lightning bolt structures referred to as blue starters, jets, and gigantic jets, which are the upward electrical discharges from thunderstorms that terminate at 20-30 km, 40-50 km and 70-90 km altitude, respectively.  These are generated suddenly within a fraction of a second from thunderstorms. The research supported by this award would examine the energetics and dynamics of these TIL (Transient Luminous Event) phenomena. Typically, the initial vertical development has a speed of ~100 km/s, but after 100-300 ms, the upward discharge leading to gigantic jets suddenly accelerates to reach the lower ionosphere with a speed greater than 1000 km/s. The funded research would be primarily observational involving the construction of a high-speed (5,000 frames per second) spectrograph that can analyze the energetics of the jets and starters through the fast acquisition of visible atomic and molecular spectra allowing high-speed measurements of the relative intensities of the red-to-blue colors emitted by the lightning bolt along its path between the storm and the ionized layer. Analysis of these spectra would provide the time variations of the vertical temperature profile within the ionized air pathway of the lightning bolt. This information about the temperature profile would be used to quantify the energetics underlying the formation of these morphological features of the lightning bolt.  This award has the potential of transformative research that would provide a major advance in the knowledge and understanding of the physics of transient plasma discharges which should prove to be extremely valuable and of high importance to the study of laboratory electrical discharges and tropospheric lightning investigations; such findings would be of great value to other disciplines such as power transformers, laser fusion research, and plasma discharge systems.  The award would support significant activity in STEM education and student training similar to that recently conducted by the PI and his group.  Finally, this award has a strong potential of attracting public attention via local TV and newspaper interviews.  The grant awardees indicated also that they would provide the public with excellent public access to the research with frequent open lectures that would generate strong interest by the public in lightning phenomena.<br/><br/>The award represents a strong potential for exciting and transformative science. The proposed research would examine in detail fundamental science questions that are related to jet and starter dynamics and their electrical coupling between the lower atmosphere and ionosphere.  Moreover, the proposed observational approach is sophisticated providing critical high-time resolution spectral information on the spectral properties of starters and jets that would be studied to produce height profiles of temperature along the path of the conductive path between the top side of the thunderstorm and the lower ionosphere region established by the lightning bolt."

Due to changes in sea level that took place over the last 125 thousand years, the Adriatic Sea first contracted and then expanded. Consequently, Po Delta migrated offshore by almost 300 km and then retreated back to its current location. This project will examine how these long-term changes impacted the delta. Documenting how coastal zones responded to past climate shifts is important because coastlines are particularly sensitive to current environmental changes. In the case of Po Plain, its diverse marine life is already in decline and its agricultural wealth is under threat. The local historical cities such as Venice are at risk as well. By using Po Delta as a model example for coastal responses to environmental changes, the project will also serve as a platform for K-12 activities, public outreach, and undergraduate and post-graduate training. The project will result in a public exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History and foster international partnership between University of Florida and University of Bologna.<br/><br/>A total of 112 sediment cores drilled under the Adriatic Sea will be used to reconstruct the geologic and ecologic history of Po Delta. The core sediment data will be used to describe the internal architecture of the delta. The cores should also produce ~1000 samples of marine fossils. In addition, geochemical methods will be employed to numerically date 400 mollusk specimens. Multivariate analyses and computer models will be applied to explore the resulting data. These analyses will allow for testing hypotheses regarding the development of river deltas under different climate regimes and long-term responses of marine ecosystems to environmental changes."

Granular materials are ubiquitous - they include naturally-occurring materials such as sand, soil, and snow, as well as industrial and agricultural materials such as pharmaceutical pills and capsules, food grains, and catalyst particles. Predicting the behavior of these materials during flow poses special challenges, especially when the granular material consists of particles of different sizes. In this case, the flow causes the particles to segregate according to size, which, in turn, affects the flow of the material as a whole. The theory developed in this project will use nonlocal modeling to describe a representative granular material consisting of particles of two different sizes - called bidisperse. The resulting model will predict the flow behavior of this bidisperse system in several prototype flow geometries, and the results will be compared with corresponding experiments conducted as part of the project. A variety of educational activities are also planned, including the development of new modules illustrating computational methods in solid mechanics. The project will enlist undergraduates to participate in the research, and workshops will be conducted to disseminate results and engage broad technical communities.<br/> <br/>A predictive continuum theory, based on nonlocal modeling, will be developed that simultaneously predicts size segregation and flow in bidisperse dense granular systems composed of spherical particles. Preliminary tests have demonstrated that this approach produces a model that can predict coupled flow fields and segregation patterns. A systematic set of discrete-element calculations will be performed to isolate shear-strain-rate-driven and gravity-driven mechanisms of segregation, which will clarify the two-way coupling between flow and segregation. The model will then be generalized to three-dimensional flows using a continuum thermomechanics approach, and a finite-element implementation of the non-local, coupled theory will be developed. Predictions of the model will be validated by comparing with experiments of bidisperse granular systems in representative flow configurations."

Despite the various advantages of this low-cost technology in a biomedical imaging context including high image contrasts and suitable penetration depths, it has not been applied to any such application. The main reason is its limitation in providing sufficient resolutions for diagnostic purposes. This proposal offers a novel approach by which an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically. This will improve image resolutions to values previously unattained. The main focus of this proposal is the development of a portable and low-cost skin imaging device that can image tissue layers over their depths with high resolutions while offering satisfactory contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. By diagnosing skin tumors at an early stage, the device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation's healthcare system. The proposed research will be combined with various educational and outreach efforts aimed at involving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the proposed research and raising their interests in bio-electromagnetics and bio-medical imaging. The PI will specifically pursue the following main goals: 1) engaging high school students through the Liberty Science Center's ""Partners in Science"" program, 2) recruiting undergraduate students, especially from female and minority groups, through the Summer Scholars Research Program at Stevens Institute and motivating them to continue towards graduate studies, 3) participating in the events and seminars organized by the Center for Healthcare Innovation at Stevens, 4) establishing a course on biomedical applications of electromagnetics at Stevens, and 5) disseminating the results of the research at professional conferences and technical journals.<br/><br/> ""Synthetic"" ultra-wideband millimeter-wave imaging, a novel approach in which an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth will be explored. This cannot be realized by any conventional design method and is therefore assembled ""synthetically"", resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of acquired images. The synthetic increase is achieved by dividing the desired bandwidth into a number of adjacent sub-bands or channels. Each channel contains an antenna unit which is optimized for operation within that specific sub-band. The sub-band antennas are successively placed in front of the target, transmit their signals, and record the backscattered responses. The responses are then processed and combined to synthesize an integrated signal as if it were collected from a virtual equivalent ultra-wideband antenna. By using this concept, the challenges of realizing high-performance ultra-wideband antennas in the millimeter-wave regime are alleviated as each antenna is optimized within a limited bandwidth. An imaging system will be developed based on this approach for the detection of skin tumors in ex-vivo tissue measurements. The system will be optimized and miniaturized through developing a new class of wideband, miniaturized patch antennas for use in multi-static sensor arrays. The final imaging setup will be readily applicable to point-of-care and hand-held imaging devices. The <br/>""synthetic"" ultra-wideband imaging approach will lead to image resolutions which are unachievable using conventional imaging methods. The approach is versatile, as the number and position of the channels can be adjusted to cover any frequency range as required for the specific application. These capabilities bring a whole new level of functionality to millimeter-wave imaging systems and enable applications that are not currently feasible. Furthermore, the new class of wideband, miniaturized patch antennas which will be developed for the miniaturization and optimization of the final imagining setup will be highly desirable for a variety of communication and imaging applications in the millimeter-wave regime."

Information critical in planning logistics activities to support disaster response has traditionally been gathered via time-consuming efforts such as on the ground assessments. The use of social media during emergencies enables collecting a larger amount of potentially life saving information in a shorter amount of time. Many emergency managers have indicated their agency would take action on social data only after verifying it. This strategy contradicts the timeliness of social data; one of its primary advantages. The products of this research will directly address concerns over the usefulness of social data in decision making by quantifying the value of considering the information at various stages of verification. Results will be translated to the first responder community via a simulated game to provide a comparative demonstration of response planning with and without social data. New generations of engineers will be inspired to pursue careers in humanitarian logistics and infiltrate the field with social data concepts by integrating games and case studies into courses and summer programs and involving students in the research.<br/><br/>Novel models for uncertainty in real-time logistics planning will be developed that contribute to dynamic and stochastic routing in a number of ways. First, traditional assumptions of homeostatic probability distributions for modeled random variables do not hold, as crowdsourcing efforts constantly provide new information regarding the relative degree of belief in the accuracy of uncertain social data. Second, the models will allow timely action on uncertain requests instead of delaying resource allocation until the complete demand scenario is known. Sampling methods to account for these differences will be developed. Seminars and expert interviews with the first responder community will be conducted to select relevant routing problem variants and information formats. These activities will also determine a set of social data logistics strategies of practical interest to emergency managers, defined as policies that specify to what extent social data should be incorporated in a response plan. Developed models will be used to assess strategy performance across a diverse set of test instances based on real disasters. This will result in the identification of scenarios where social data integration can improve response efficacy, potentially transforming disaster response with methods that enable serving (saving) a larger number of needs (lives) in a shorter amount of time."

Escalating environmental pollution problems, such as contamination of water with hazardous chemicals, and the need for proper restoration of clean environment, is a global/societal concern that warrants immediate attention.  This project endeavors to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms for the interactions between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and organic contaminants, which is a major step forward in developing CNT-based environmental remediation method.  The project provides training to  undergraduate and graduate students in  nanofabrication, characterization and computational techniques and their applications for contamination removal from water.   The collaborative research team is also organizing an international workshop at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, in order to raise the global awareness of emerging water contamination issues.  <br/><br/>Specifically, state of the art experimental tools as well as advanced modeling are utilized to understand how different chemical contaminants interact with different architectures of CNTs, in order to identify the most suitable carbon nanotube based materials to remove hazardous chemicals from water efficiently.  The project studies (i) the nature of the adsorption for organic contaminants (in particular, the ionizable compounds) with varying molecular structures and properties, (ii) the extent to which the presence of co-contaminants as well as key environmental parameters affect the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants, and (iii) the adsorption kinetics for CNTs with different sizes or curvature and surface chemistry.  The research team plans to perform systematic adsorption studies of a wide array of organic contaminants on CNTs and conduct extensive electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights on the intermolecular forces taking place at the liquid-solid interface when contaminants are exposed to CNTs in water. The collabortive team also plans to investigate how environmental conditions such as ionic strength and pH shift the intermolecular forces and affect the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants onto CNTs. Built on the understanding of the intermolecular forces, it should be possible to examine how different surface functionalization approaches affect the adsorption behavior of organic contaminants to CNTs, setting out defining principles for the design of functional adsorbant nanoparticles."

In particular, in the ocean, phosphorous is a key limiting nutrient, controlling levels of primary productivity across large swaths of the ocean. Removal of phosphorous occurs largely via formation of stable apatite minerals in ocean sediments. However, average ocean conditions generally inhibit the formation of apatite, thus the abundance of apatite minerals in marine sediments is a mystery. This research aims to determine the mechanisms of apatite formation in the ocean to answer this century-old question. Evaluating these mechanisms will greatly advance current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean. A more detailed understanding of phosphorous cycling can be applied across the disciplines of ocean science, and because of the importance of phosphorous as a nutrient and an element with a variety of interactions with other elements, it will be applicable to a variety of other research questions. The researchers are dedicated to promoting diversity in ocean science and plan to include undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the study. They will also mentor a postdoc and communicate their science to the public and K-12 teachers via a blog entitled ?Britannica Blog?, the Atlanta Science Festival, a rock show, and educational material, the latter two to be developed as part of this work.  <br/><br/>Marine phosphorous burial via authigenic stable apatite formation in sediments is a major pathway for phosphorous removal in the ocean. However, in most marine environments, under natural conditions, this process is kinetically inhibited. It has been a mystery for more than a century as to how it is therefore possible for apatite to be oversaturated in large areas of marine sediments. A possible mechanism that could explain 95% of the apatite burial flux is that apatite minerals are precipitated as fine-grained particles from exogenous polyphosphate intermediates. Exogenous polyphosphates have been understudied, despite this possible importance as a mechanism for phosphorous removal. As a consequence this research could revolutionize current understanding of phosphorous cycling in the ocean for the major aim is to make a thorough and detailed study of the mechanisms behind marine apatite formation, focusing on the role of exogenous polyphosphate particles. Phosphorous is an element with widespread importance in ocean sciences, and more clearly understanding its burial will have applications across the disciplines."

This information is critical in identifying opportunities for conservation, forecasting demand, and determining how water use patterns may change over time in response to population growth, demographic shifts, and technology improvements. CIWS will advance understanding of water use behavior, the cyberinfrastructure for smart metering, and the pool of ""cyber-savvy"" professionals and students capable of implementing smart metering, all of which are critical for realizing the promises of smart metering.

The Hawaiian bobtail squid is a model animal host for studying relationships with beneficial bacteria. Females of this and many other squid species harbor bacteria in a specialized organ of their reproductive tract. The function of these bacteria is unknown, but they may assist with protecting such eggs from fouling by other microorganisms.  This work will use genetic and chemical analyses to determine whether these beneficial bacteria and the compounds that they produce can inhibit the growth of fungi and other microorganisms. The ability of these bacteria to induce development of the squid's reproductive organ will also be studied.

Results of the study may lead to the discovery of novel anti-fungal and anti-microbial compounds.<br/><br/>Preliminary studies characterized the bacterial consortium found in the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) of the squid Euprymna scolopes, and suggest that ANG bacteria deposited into eggs protect developing embryos from fungal biofilms. Furthermore, female squid raised in the absence of bacteria do not form an ANG by sexual maturity, suggesting that bacteria may be necessary for proper development of the organ.  Based on these results, the proposed research has three main objectives.  1) Isolate and identify bioactive metabolites from ANG and egg bacteria that show activity against fungal and other microbial biofilms, and determine if bioactive bacterial strains or isolated compounds can rescue eggs upon fungal challenge.  The use of molecular networks would compare secondary metabolite production by these bacterial isolates.  2) Use transcriptomics to characterize bacterial gene expression in active bacterial isolates. This information, along with sequence transcriptomes and metagenomes from whole ANGs, eggs and genomes of active bacterial isolates, would be used to predict the biosynthetic pathways leading to antimicrobial secondary metabolite production that may be involved with egg protection. 3) Characterize the role of bacteria in the development of the ANG, by testing whether ANG bacterial isolates from the consortium are capable of inducing morphogenesis of the ANG.  The project would examine whether eggs from females without an ANG are susceptible to fouling, and whether eggs challenged with fungi can be rescued with active bacterial isolates and/or compounds."

However, there is a strong and deep connection between them through a hidden, more basic, theme: identifying structure in randomness. The central motif is that understanding what role randomness and pseudorandomness have in computation can be a guiding approach to questions in complexity theory, communication complexity, algorithm design, and more. <br/><br/>The proposed research has potential for impacting several areas such as complexity theory, optimization, streaming algorithms, cryptography, and communication complexity; these areas in turn touch several core fields of computer science that impact all of science and even our daily lives. For example, pseudorandom generators are useful for saving space in streaming algorithms which in turn are important for processing massive amounts of data as is done in many modern applications. An integral part of the proposed research plan is to educate both undergraduate and graduate students. The PI intends to involve students at all levels in performing the research outlined in the proposal by actively advising PhD students as well as guiding undergraduate students on research projects.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project aims to address the following three questions:<br/><br/>1) Pseudorandomness: Can randomness in algorithms be removed at the expense of a constant-factor increase in space? Recent work has led to the resolution of several longstanding challenges in this context and the new techniques can potentially lead to further progress.<br/><br/>2) Optimization hierarchies and hardness of approximation: Semi-definite programming (SDP) hierarchies are some of the most powerful techniques in algorithm design. Can a comprehensive theory to understand the power and limitations of the semi-definite hierarchies be developed for problems in approximation algorithms? This is a particularly pressing issue for problems where we do not have NP-hardness results as is the case for uniform sparsest cut, the unique games problem, or average-case problems like the planted clique problem.<br/><br/>3) Communication complexity: Can we characterize precisely the communication complexity of ?lifted problems??one of the most studied classes of functions in this context? Such a characterization will likely simplify the task of analyzing communication costs significantly. <br/><br/>There is a rich history of interaction between the above pivotal areas and these connections should be investigated anew in light of the recent progress in the respective fields over the last few years."

When light is absorbed in such a device, it can create electrons with more energy than needed to execute the desired function, so-called hot-electrons, which generally dissipate this energy as heat, resulting in power loss and device inefficiency. The first goal of this project is to advance the understanding of these hot-electrons, which will enable devices with unprecedented functionality and performance that can be applied to problems of global importance, e.g. solar energy generation, wireless communication, etc. The second goal of this project is to integrate the research into education by creating a suite of online learning tools for widespread dissemination of ideas and techniques in alternative energy. In conjunction with these online resources, this program will provide educational support to a wide range of audiences including the general community through public outreach and the mentoring of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>Technical: Ohmic loss is one of the major hindrances to high efficiency plasmonic devices due to energy dissipation of excited charge carriers within the metal. A similar effect, known as thermalization, also limits photovoltaic efficiency in solar energy devices. It is thus important to understand and mitigate these various loss mechanisms in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Through this program the PI will investigate the optoelectronic properties of fabricated structures capable of generating and extracting these carriers before heat dissipation occurs.  These studies will encompass light absorption, carrier generation and collection, as well as material and surface interface engineering to modify energy barrier heights, leading to a new understanding of how hot electronic processes work in plasmonic nanostructures. This knowledge will be applied to a novel class of plasmonic devices based on hot carriers, which enable simultaneous control of optical and electronic properties."

A fundamental challenge is that detailed geometric models and advanced nonlinear materials increase computational complexity, making them difficult to apply in real-time interactive applications.  In this research, the PI will investigate an alternative approach based on geometric shape deformations rather than the processes which created them.  He argues that intuitive shape deformation can be facilitated by guarantees of basic geometric properties such as smoothness and injectivity (no self-intersection).  The key is to design algorithms that can do this quickly while providing the user with a small yet expressive set of adjustable controls to ensure an efficient interactive experience; the task of shape deformation techniques is to extrapolate this parsimonious, human manageable set of input controls into a full-scale 3D deformation field in a natural and predictable way.  The PI's hypothesis is that this requirement can be formally expressed in terms of basic geometric properties.  To this end, the PI will explore both direct (closed-form) and variational methods, because while direct methods excel in speed variational methods offer stronger guarantees and advanced geometric properties.  In terms of direct methods, the PI will develop new ways to quickly blend certain groups of 3D transformations (e.g., with the help of new geometric algebraic structures).  Transformation blending will be complemented by advanced influence weights that allow the user to explicitly control the resulting sparseness.  In terms of variational methods, the PI will study deformation energies satisfying traditional properties such as rotation invariance but augmented with higher-order continuity and injectivity; here, the main challenge will be to find efficient numerical solutions for the underlying optimization problems.  The PI believes it will prove possible to mitigate the inherent computational complexity of variational methods by suitably combining them with direct methods so as to cast some of the variational problems as convex optimizations, thereby opening the door to highly efficient convex solvers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Shape deformation is relevant to architecture, computer aided design (CAD), and many areas of science and engineering, as well as to the entertainment industry.  But this project has primarily been motivated by medical applications, inspired by requests from the PI's collaborators at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  Given the right tools, the classical field of hand drawn medical illustration will evolve into 3D animated medical atlases, setting new standards in medical education.  Shape deformation techniques could ultimately contribute to clinical praxis, by facilitating diagnosis and pre-operative planning when treating conditions such as pathological skull deformities (craniosynostosis).  And shape modeling tools in expert hands could help lower the radiation dose required in CT scanning, by applying new reconstruction methods that combine user input with template models and accurate surface scans (obtained with radiation-free methods such as laser scanning).  The PI also will organize seminars and courses that bring together medical and engineering students, including members of underrepresented groups, thereby promoting interdisciplinary collaboration in both research and education."

As a renewable and locally available resource, the use of biomass as a CPI feedstock will have a synergistic effect on the U.S. economy by supporting the agricultural sector and promoting future innovation and growth of the CPI. The switch from current fossil fuel based CPI to a future CPI that utilizes biomass feedstock will require substantial amounts of research & development (R&D) and capital investments for technology development both by the CPI and the government. There is opportunity for investigating how these investments will impact the evolution of the biomass feedstock system.<br/><br/>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop novel models and computational methods that are capable of predicting the impact of R&D and capital investment decisions (how much to invest and in which technology and when) on the evolution of biomass conversion technologies for CPI feedstock development. Two characteristics of this system, uncertain decision-dependent endogenous technology evolutions and game theoretic issues, limit the applicability of existing representations and methods. Drawing analogies to the R&D pipeline management and graph theory, the PI proposes two frameworks to analyze this problem. First, the PI will investigate the effectiveness of these frameworks for the investment problem with respect to four criteria: easy scalability, universality, ability to represent the uncertain evolution paths of different technologies, and amenability to community upkeep and expansion. The PI will next develop simulation-based optimization approaches to the investment problem assuming perfect information sharing among the government and CPI agents. Lastly, the PI will develop an agent-based framework embedding simulation-based optimization approach as decision models in the agent-based framework and investigate the impact of game-theoretic issues on the investment decisions when complete information is not available to any party. This research to study the biomass-to commodity chemicals investment decision problem should lead to advances in representation of technological developments and evolution problems, large-scale solution capability of stochastic optimization problems with exogenous and endogenous uncertainties, and fundamental understanding of how game theoretic issues impact new technology development and evolution, particularly for the biomass feedstock system.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The overarching goals of the education plan are to integrate research and education and contribute to the diversity of the engineering workforce and scientific community by training students in systems-level thinking. These goals will be achieved by:<br/>1. Integrating research themes and projects that require and promote systems-level thinking and interdisciplinary work into traditional engineering undergraduate curriculum courses,<br/>2. Expanding the undergraduate/graduate-level course, Risk Management and Optimization (developed by the PI) and integrating projects from this research into the course,<br/>3. Engaging and mentoring at least two undergraduate students per year in this research project utilizing two successful unique campus wide capstone programs that promote student participation in original research programs, and<br/>4. Recruiting and supervising at least two full time graduate students who will pursue advanced degrees in chemical engineering. <br/><br/>Advances in biomass feedstock conversion could lead to advances ranging from hybrid and seed engineering, to fertilizer and other agricultural techniques, to classical chemical catalysis. Because of the importance to U.S. national and economic security and the range of options available for evolving a complex biomass feedstock system, this work has potential for scientific, technical and societal impact. In addition to the dissemination of the results via scientific publications and at national and international meetings, the developed models will be made available for the use of the community through the World Wide Web."

Although progress is being made in achieving greater diversity within some STEM communities, it has been challenging to scale up the use of effective practices for increasing diversity in order to realize greater impact at the national level.  To address this challenge, NSF has launched a new NSF-wide FY 2016 initiative called ""Inclusion Across the Nation of Communities of Learners that have been Underrepresented for Diversity in Engineering and Science"" (NSF INCLUDES).  The Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) is contributing to the NSF INCLUDES initiative through the GEO Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity (GOLD) program, which is using the Ideas Lab mechanism to create innovate, interdisciplinary approaches for building a national network of geoscientists who can help to advance NSF's broadening participation goals and objectives.  Participants in the Ideas Lab are being recruited from communities with expertise in the geosciences, social-psychology, institutional transformation, broadening participation research, and research on leadership development.<br/><br/>The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), in collaboration with Knowinnovation, Inc.

Potential user segments for disdrometers include federal agencies and similar international agencies, research institutes, universities, airports, and weather stations.  Majority of the disdrometer systems are either optical or impact type disdrometers, which are associated with various instrumental measurement artifacts.

A key component of both challenges is energy storage.  At the moment, the most economical and efficient way of storing solar energy is electrical battery.  Lithium-ion battery is considered the most promising technology for high density energy storage, and silicon is the highest capacity anode material.  Despite the rapid development and significant progress made in recent years, capacity degradation and short lifetime have not been solved for silicon based anodes.

Understanding subglacial hydrology, the persistence of life in extended isolation and the evolution and stability of subglacial habitats requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach. The collaborative project, Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration (MIDGE) of the Biogeochemistry, Hydrology and Glaciology of Blood Falls, McMurdo Dry Valleys will integrate geophysical measurements, molecular microbial ecology and geochemical analyses to explore a unique Antarctic subglacial system known as Blood Falls. Blood Falls is a hypersaline, subglacial brine that supports an active microbial community. The subglacial brine is released from a crevasse at the surface of the Taylor Glacier providing an accessible portal into an Antarctic subglacial ecosystem. Recent geochemical and molecular analyses support a marine source for the salts and microorganisms in Blood Falls. The last time marine waters inundated this part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys was during the Late Tertiary, which suggests the brine is ancient. Still, no direct samples have been collected from the subglacial source to Blood Falls and little is known about the origin of this brine or the amount of time it has been sealed below Taylor Glacier. Radar profiles collected near Blood Falls delineate a possible fault in the subglacial substrate that may help explain the localized and episodic nature of brine release. However it remains unclear what triggers the episodic release of brine exclusively at the Blood Falls crevasse or the extent to which the brine is altered as it makes its way to the surface. <br/><br/>The MIDGE project aims to determine the mechanism of brine release at Blood Falls, evaluate changes in the geochemistry and the microbial community within the englacial conduit and assess if Blood Falls waters have a distinct impact on the thermal and stress state of Taylor Glacier, one of the most studied polar glaciers in Antarctica. The geophysical study of the glaciological structure and mechanism of brine release will use GPR, GPS, and a small passive seismic network. Together with international collaborators, the 'Ice Mole' team from FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Germany (funded by the German Aerospace Center, DLR), MIDGE will develop and deploy innovative, minimally invasive technologies for clean access and brine sample retrieval from deep within the Blood Falls drainage system. These technologies will allow for the collection of samples of the brine away from the surface (up to tens of meters) for geochemical analyses and microbial structure-function experiments. There is concern over the contamination of pristine subglacial environments from chemical and biological materials inherent in the drilling process; and MIDGE will provide data on the efficacy of thermoelectric probes for clean access and retrieval of representative subglacial samples. Antarctic subglacial environments provide an excellent opportunity for researching survivability and adaptability of microbial life and are potential terrestrial analogues for life habitats on icy planetary bodies. The MIDGE project offers a portable, versatile, clean alternative to hot water and mechanical drilling and will enable the exploration of subglacial hydrology and ecosystem function while making significant progress towards developing technologies for minimally invasive and clean sampling of icy systems."

Innovation is a key 21st Century Skill and is important for allowing the United States to retain its competitive edge within industry. It is also a skill that can set engineering students apart when it comes time for them to seek a position within industry. The epistemic game being tested creates a virtual work environment for students, which allows them to actively participate in a product design company, interact with group design members, complete tasks for their virtual manager and gain input from consultants within the company on whether their design is meeting the needs of the company. Students will also interact with end use customers for their design which will help them develop a better understanding of the role customer input plays in the product design process.<br/><br/>This Research Initiation project will provide a unique opportunity for the PI to determine the effectiveness of epistemic games as an instructional tool for teaching engineering students about product design. This project will also provide a great opportunity for the PI and the graduate student involved to learn more about qualitative and quantitative research techniques in education and how these can be applied to measure innovation within product design.

The findings from the interviews are being used to create faculty development materials and educational materials for future faculty members. Characterizing what and how faculty think about gender will provide a basis for appropriate and successful interventions for faculty and future faculty because rather than merely picking an intervention haphazardly, interventions should be strategically selected to align with the most salient issues or problems. Materials are being implemented at faculty development centers, workshops at national engineering education conferences, and in a newly created graduate course at Oregon State University. Faculty development materials created enhance intellectual infrastructure locally and nationally by providing the first research-based interventions of this kind.

Growing reliance on these hardware IPs, often gathered from untrusted third-party vendors, severely affects the security and trustworthiness of the final system. The hardware IPs acquired from external sources may come with deliberate malicious implants, undocumented interfaces working as hidden backdoor, or other integrity issues. Tampered hardware IPs can lead to security and privacy concerns (e.g., when used in handheld devices) as well as life-threatening consequences (e.g., when used in safety-critical systems). It is extremely difficult to verify the integrity and trustworthiness of hardware IPs due to incomplete functional specifications and lack of golden reference models. To address this critical need, in this project, we develop a comprehensive and scalable framework for IP trust analysis and verification. We evaluate IPs of diverse types and forms and develop threat models, taxonomy and instances of IP trust/integrity issues. We investigate an integrative IP trust validation framework that combines the complementary abilities of functional, structural and parametric verification. We employ both statistical as well as judicious directed tests to sensitize rarely triggered malicious changes and observe their effects. The unified validation framework is flexible to detect diverse tampering efforts, scalable to large designs, and eliminates the need for a golden model. A platform for IP trust validation, threat analysis, and trust metrics would provide enabling technology to future designers to implement secure and trusted systems for diverse applications."

Global change models predict boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity with climate warming. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, changes in the fire regime are likely to alter global C cycling. Increased fire activity will increase C emissions to the atmosphere, with a potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, an altered fire regime may also initiate cascading effects on forest regrowth and permafrost degradation that could magnify or offset this feedback. Fire effects on these ecological mechanisms remain uncertain but will ultimately determine whether arctic ecosystems act as a C source or sink under future climate change scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to increase our understanding of post-fire C dynamics in boreal forests of the Siberian arctic by elucidating the ecological mechanisms by which increased fire severity could influence C accumulation and storage over the successional interval. The overarching hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth regulates net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) through indirect impacts on forest regrowth and permafrost stability because of its role as a barrier to seed germination and thermal regulator. The team will: 1) link near term fire effects on SOL depth to changes in larch recruitment and permafrost characteristics in experimental burn plots created in 2012, 2) determine the relationship between post-fire stand structure and above- and belowground C pools at the local and landscape level across stands of varying age and topographic positions, and 3) test via experimental manipulations and field observations the mechanisms by which fire-driven changes in stand density indirectly affect moss growth, SOL development, and susceptibility of deeper C pools to warming, decomposition, and release into the atmosphere. This research will offer novel insights into the importance of both vegetation and soil processes within arctic ecosystems in determining the net feedback of an intensified fire regime to the climate system.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Larch forests of the Siberian arctic comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are distinct from other boreal forests in that they consist of a single tree genus (Larix spp.) with a deciduous growth habit and often grow on continuous, C-rich ?yedoma? permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of how arctic forest fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up arctic C pools, estimating C emissions from arctic fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students from two predominantly undergraduate institutions and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. The PI and her students will develop outreach activities with local K-12 schools in south Texas to help teachers create lesson plans involving arctic science, boreal ecology, and climate change and involve researcher presentations to science classrooms to provide real-life examples of arctic research and expose K-12 students to different career and educational paths in the sciences."

Accurate regulation of gene activity is a key element of every major biological process. Specialized protein machineries regulate gene activity by decoding the information carried in DNA to satisfy the ever-changing needs of the cell. One such protein complex, known as Mediator, is recognized as a critical regulator of gene activity from yeast to humans, yet little is known about its mechanism of action. This research project investigates the function of two proteins within the Mediator complex, CDK8 and CDK19. Preliminary results demonstrate that CDK8 and CDK19 regulate the activity of different groups of genes involved in diverse cellular functions. This project aims to define the molecular mechanisms by which CDK8 and CDK19 enable cells to adjust the activity of different gene sets in response to changes in the cellular environment. This research is expected to have a transformative impact on the understanding of Mediator in particular and the evolution of gene expression control mechanisms in general. Given the quasi-universal role of Mediator in the control of gene activity, the discoveries arising from this project will have far reaching implications in the fields of cellular and molecular biology. Moreover, the innovative techniques developed in this project for the study of Mediator in human cells will produce a positive ripple effect in the gene expression field by enabling similar studies of other gene regulators.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project is carried out by a teaching-research team that strongly promotes science education and diversity in academia.

A unique feature of these biomaterials is that they consist of bio-macromolecules with ionizable groups. In aqueous solutions, properties of these materials are influenced by electrostatic interactions between ionized groups, by interactions with surrounding media, and by the ionic strength of the solutions. The main goal of this research is to understand the specific role of electrostatic interactions on adhesion and lubrication in biological and polymeric systems. This will be achieved through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, self-consistent field calculations, and scaling analysis. These techniques will be used to develop a model of lubrication for the glycoprotein-collagen network layer covering cartilage surfaces. Theory and simulations will be used to study the system's static and dynamic properties as a function of salt concentration, solution pH, fraction of charged groups, molecular architecture, and sliding velocity. The overarching objective of this research will be to understand the effect of dielectric discontinuity on adhesion and friction at the nanoscale. The predictions of the theoretical models will be tested in computer simulations and verified experimentally through collaboration with experimental research groups in the US.

These sensors continuously track the health of large, complex power grids with high accuracy. However, as the number of these sensors increases up into the thousands, grid operators are struggling to understand how the gigantic volumes of data can be efficiently communicated to control centers for taking timely control actions, especially in face of critical grid disturbances. Developing a reliable wide-area communication network that guarantees just-in-time data delivery is the greatest challenge. Unfortunately, neither the architecture of such networks nor the impacts of delays and data losses on control actions are well understood. This project will address this gap, and develop a highly resilient, fault-tolerant, and reliable distributed network control system for tomorrow's power grids using cutting-edge emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and software defined networks. Power systems are a critical infrastructural component in modern society. Therefore, results of this research will have a tremendous scientific impact on the smart grid and smart city research communities. The proposed multidisciplinary approach, test bed prototyping, and industry collaborations will help in educating next-generation workforce in the fields of smart grids and cyber-physical systems.    <br/><br/>Overcoming network-induced latencies, data losses, and bandwidth limitations is the key for successful deployment of at-scale wide-area control of power systems. The merit of this research lies in the development of a distributed networked control system infrastructure that addresses all of these concerns. The approach encompasses multiple disciplines, ranging from power systems to control systems to advanced networking and cloud computing technologies. The proposed architecture will be realized via three interactive layers. Layer 1 will consist of physics-based controllers for power oscillation damping. Layer 2 will contain delay control rules for the communication network that work in tandem with the grid controllers. Layer 3 will consist of a supervisory controller realized through embedding and reconfiguration rules in a distributed cloud environment that continuously monitors the system status, and ensures fault-tolerance, resilience, and reliability of the overall closed-loop control system. The project team will also develop an integrated software and hardware testbed with open interfaces that can be used by other educational institutions."

Understanding how these different strategies arise, and the circumstances that favor one strategy over another, is critical to explain why species live where they do, and how they will respond to future environmental change. In this project, the researchers are studying how plants respond to uncertainty in the amount of water they experience by conducting controlled experiments with plants that occupy seasonally-flooded wetlands in western North America. These plants occupy different habitats within the wetlands - ranging from the deepest to the shallowest positions - and thus are expected to show a range of responses to different water conditions. By evaluating how these plants adjust to uncertainty in soil moisture and flooding, the scientists will gain a general understanding of the different ways that organisms handle changes in their environments. This knowledge is broadly significant for predicting how organisms will respond to future environmental uncertainty, including climate change, habitat loss, and biological invasions. In addition, these results will directly affect the management of plants and animals that occupy wetlands, and the results of this work will be directly communicated to practitioners involved in the conservation and restoration of wetland ecosystems.<br/><br/>In these experiments, the investigators manipulate the overall levels of water availability (ranging from drought to flooding), as well as the extent of variability in soil moisture and flooding, in a series of controlled experiments in a growth chamber environment. The study organisms are three annual species of Lasthenia (Asteraceae) that are adapted to different hydrological environments within vernal pool wetlands in California. The researchers will measure the survival and reproductive output of these three species under the different water treatments, while also measuring changes in leaves and root architecture to quantify plant phenotypic responses to fluctuating hydrological conditions. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that phenotypic flexibility (i.e., plasticity in leaf and root traits) will be important for predicting plant performance when water levels fluctuate, but that this plasticity may reduce performance when water levels are constant. We also predict that the three species will exhibit unique responses to the water treatments that reflect adaptations to their respective microhabitats."

These systems range from the writhing and coiling of DNA, to the beating and pumping of cilia and flagella, to the flow of blood in the body, to the locomotion of fish, insects, and birds. This project aims to develop advanced software infrastructure for performing dynamic computer simulations of such biological and biomedical systems. To facilitate the deployment of this software in a range of scientific and engineering applications, this project will develop new software capabilities in concert with new computer models that use the software. Specific application domains to be advanced in this project include models of aquatic locomotion that can be used to understand the neural control of movement and ultimately to develop new treatments for neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injuries, and models that simulate the interaction between the electrophysiology of the heart and the contractions of the heart that pump blood throughout the body, which could lead to improved approaches to treating heart disease. The software to be developed within the project is freely available online and is used by a number of independent research groups in a variety of scientific and engineering domains. It is being actively used in projects that model different aspects of cardiovascular dynamics, such as platelet aggregation and the dynamics of natural and prosthetic heart valves, and in projects that study other biological problems, including cancer dynamics, insect flight, aquatic locomotion, and the dynamics of phytoplankton. The software is also being applied to non-biological problems, including nanoscale models of colloidal suspensions and models of active particles. The improved methods and software to be developed in this project will thereby have a broad and sustained impact on a large number of ongoing research efforts in the biological and biomedical sciences and other scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>The immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly applicable framework for modeling and simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The IB method was introduced to model the fluid dynamics of heart valves, and subsequent development initially focused on simulating cardiac fluid dynamics. This methodology is broadly useful, however, and has been applied to a variety of problems in which a fluid flow interacts with immersed structures, including elastic bodies, bodies with known or prescribed deformational kinematics, and rigid bodies. Extensions of the IB method have also been developed to model electrophysiological systems and systems with chemically active structures. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the PI has developed adaptive versions of the IB method that employ structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where needed. These methods have been implemented within the IBAMR software framework, which provides parallel implementations of the IB method and its extensions that leverage high-quality computational libraries including SAMRAI, PETSc, and libMesh. This project will further extend the IBAMR software by implementing modeling and discretization technologies required by the research applications of current and prospective users of the software, by developing improved solver infrastructure facilitated by the implementation of native support for structured AMR discretizations in the PETSc library, and by integrating with existing high-quality software tools for model development, deployment, and analysis. IBAMR is freely distributed online and is used within a number of independent research groups both to the further development of the IB method and also to its application to simulate diverse problems in fluid dynamics and FSI. By enhancing IBAMR, this project will also enhance the ability of these and other researchers to construct detailed models without requiring those researchers to develop the significant software infrastructure needed to perform such simulations. This project will also develop general-purpose support for AMR discretizations in PETSc, a software library with thousands of active users, ~400 downloads per month, and numerous applications. The work of this project will help to grow the IBAMR user community of students and researchers by developing UI tools for building models, running simulations, and analyzing results. Students will be actively engaged in all aspects of the project, including code, method, and model development."

The conference takes place in St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, in January 2016. POPL is a forum for the discussion of leading work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader significance and importance includes supporting travel for women and underrepresented minorities, thereby fostering a diverse pool of next generation researchers in this important research area. In particular, students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise."

In battery and<br/>cooling constrained environments such as mobile devices, sustained power<br/>(and, consequently, peak performance) must be limited to at most a few<br/>watts so that the device can dissipate heat using only passive<br/>convection. However, many interactive mobile applications (such as<br/>handwriting/speech recognition or image-based search) instead call for<br/>bursts of intense computation in response to user input, creating the<br/>need for a new ultra-responsive operating regime: rather than limit peak<br/>power assuming sustained operation, systems should instead exploit heat<br/>storage to enable brief computation bursts that greatly exceed<br/>sustainable thermal limits without overheating.  This project<br/>investigates an approach called ""computational sprinting"", the central<br/>essence of which is to compute at unsustainable rates but only briefly<br/>so that temperatures do not reach unsafe levels.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to address the architectural, thermal,<br/>electrical, and software barriers to ultra-responsiveness via<br/>computational sprinting. In particular, the project explores: (1)<br/>architectures and memory systems that sprint via parallelism (activating<br/>tens of reserve functional units/cores) and voltage boosting<br/>(overdriving cores for single-thread performance) while facilitating<br/>fast burst onsets; (2) thermal designs that improve thermal response<br/>behavior to enable longer and more intense sprints; (3) mobile-optimized <br/>electrical designs that provide stable supply voltages<br/>despite current surges of an order-of-magnitude or more; and <br/>(4) software mechanisms that explicitly manage limited thermal budgets <br/>and anticipate and stage data needed during the sprint.  The project<br/>includes the fabrication of an experimental testbed to approximate the<br/>computational, thermal and electrical capabilities of a future many-core<br/>mobile device and to provide practical experience with sprinting.<br/>Project impacts include (1) developing and advancing techniques for<br/>improving the responsiveness of mobile devices and (2) integrating the<br/>discoveries into a new cross-departmental course on computer system<br/>design."

Methods to measure loss in value of a system design due to fixed requirements as well as to organizational incentives are to be developed and tested. Three research objectives are pursued as follows: 1) evaluate the impact of incorporating physics-based coupling information in a system value model to better enable trade-offs; 2) incorporate uncertainties associated with physics-based couplings to determine impact on system value; and 3) evaluate the impact of fixed requirements on the system design. The work will provide foundational theoretical and empirical investigations into the theory of large-scale systems design using a value-based approach. The research will identify the value gap due to organizational and technical couplings and the associated impact on the resulting system design, thereby providing a clear basis for changing present practice.<br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will demonstrate that requirements, organizational structure, and incentive structures can seriously impact the system value and hence, system design. Further, the research will offer alternatives to mitigate this impact, thereby enabling an increase in system value and improved system design. This can have significant impact on industries and federal agencies engaged in the design of complex engineered systems. For these engineered systems, during the detailed design stage, there may be thousands of individuals working in a team environment distributed across multiple organizations, with many of these geographically and temporally distributed, wherein these individuals operate with different preferences, beliefs, organizational structures, and incentive structures. This research can potentially result in improved theory, methods, and processes to continuity across an organization, regardless of structure, to produce the greatest system value. The results will be disseminated through a variety of conference and journal mechanisms, with the most significant outreach effort focused on a website that will also contain a ""common language"" established to span fields of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO), Value-Driven Design (VDD), and Decision Analysis (DA). Papers and tools produced will also be on this website. Outreach to students from under-represented groups will be a key effort, using the special emphasis of social sciences challenges being addressed together with technical issues."
