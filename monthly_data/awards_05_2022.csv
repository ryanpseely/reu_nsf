The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Climate change is profoundly altering environments across the planet, and while previous research has focused on the impacts of warm seasons, some of the most dramatic changes are in winter climate. To understand the impacts of changing climate on organisms, it is therefore critical to study how temperature-dependent processes will be altered in response to increasing winter temperatures as well. In insects, energy use rates are determined by temperature, and during winter these effects are vital in determining survival and post-winter investment. Post-winter energetic investment is determined by the overwintering life stage with larvae investing in growth, adults into reproduction, and pupae into both. This research therefore aims to identify how an insect's overwintering life stage impacts its vulnerability to energy depletion caused by warming winters. The Fellow will also provide outreach to diverse audiences that include an international workshop and the general public through the dissemination of the study?s findings.<br/> <br/>While the importance of the impacts of changing winters on organisms is starting to be understood, there is little understanding of how key life history characteristics impact the susceptibility of different species. This research aims to establish a generalizable framework that predicts vulnerability to winter energy drain based on overwintering life stage by pairing laboratory experiments with ecophysiological models. First, energy use rates will be measured in nine species of butterflies that overwinter as adults, larvae, or pupae. Then winter energy use will be linked to reproduction in the laboratory by measuring reproductive output after cold, mild, and warm winter conditions. Energy use rates and associated reproductive outputs for each species will then be used in an ecophysiological model to predict the energetic and reproductive consequences of climate change under several possible scenarios and across geographic ranges. This will allow for the identification of species and populations that will be especially vulnerable to changing winters. The PI will gain opportunities to learn new experimentation and modeling protocols. Finally, this project aims to develop a modeling workshop that will both teach methods required for scaling physiological data to landscapes and foster international collaboration through the interaction of students at different institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The field of evolutionary biology has become instrumental in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that generate and maintain the diversity of life on the planet. This research will use rattlesnakes as a study system to understand the process of speciation by studying the mechanisms that promote lineage divergence early in this process. The project focuses on understanding how hybridizing species maintain partial reproductive isolation, and the roles of various evolutionary processes in shaping reproductive isolation. Understanding these mechanisms is important for expanding current knowledge of how species arise in nature, and how the roles of distinct evolutionary processes may shift as the speciation process proceeds. Additionally, the Fellow will be involved in training undergraduates from underrepresented groups in methods and theory related to this research. Genomes and related datasets will be published and made freely available to others in order to enhance public outreach to diverse audiences as well as advancing future investigations by the scientific community.<br/><br/>This project will use whole genome and RNA sequencing from species of the Western Rattlesnake species complex to understand the roles of various evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to reproductive isolation by comparing multiple hybrid zones and thereby investigating broad ?rules of life? that may govern the process of speciation. The Fellow will test hypotheses for the roles of genomic incompatibilities and other processes in driving reproductive isolation, and test if discovered patterns are predictable across multiple, distinct hybrid zones. The Fellow will also test the hypothesis that similar barrier traits and their underlying genomic loci impact hybrid fitness in distinct hybrid zones by integrating genomic, gene expression, phenotypic, and environmental data. These integrated analyses will be used to understand the relationships between traits and the loci that underlie them, and the roles that traits and underlying loci play in hybrid fitness and reproductive isolation. This project will involve specific training of the Fellow in bioinformatics and speciation theory, and the organization of public outreach events and research symposia; these activities include involvement of students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The trillions of microbes that inhabit animals? bodies, collectively known as microbiomes, are vital to animal ecology and health. This research explores whether microbes from the environment (soil, water, or dietary items) can contribute to the formation of animal-associated microbiomes in an endangered carnivore: the black-footed ferret. Studying these dynamics in ferrets undergoing reintroduction to natural habitats will also test whether microbial relationships impact the ferret?s health, reproduction, and overall survival in the wild. In addition to providing valuable ecological data on the role of microbes in animal-environment interactions, this research will have applied value in informing conservation strategies for other endangered animals. The Fellow will be working with the Smithsonian National Zoological Park and Conservation Biology Institute (NZP-SCBI) to conduct this research as well as to disseminate the results to the public and conservation groups; this will bring awareness of the importance of microbiomes in animal ecology and conservation to a broad and diverse audience. Outreach will include K-12 students in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This research tests the hypothesis that microbes from external sources become ?souvenir microbes? by being incorporated into and persisting within host-associated microbiomes and that these microbes ultimately affect host phenotype. Using amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (with microbial source tracking software) the Fellow will (1) characterize external microbiomes in soil, water, and prey gut and skin consortia; (2) quantify the contributions of these communities to the composition and function of ferret gut microbiomes (thereby identifying souvenir microbes); and (3) use experimental approaches (including fecal microbiota transplants) to test whether souvenir microbes persist in ferret microbiomes and influence phenotypes (e.g., immune markers, digestive function, and pathogen load). The research focuses on three black-footed ferret populations (captive, semi-wild, and wild) to assess how souvenir microbes are influenced by different environmental conditions among populations and over time. The Fellow will be jointly mentored at NZP-SCBI?s Center for Conservation Genomics and Department of Nutrition Science, providing an interdisciplinary training approach that will expand the Fellow?s knowledge, provide novel skills that integrate microbial ecology and animal physiology, and promote science communication and outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research addresses how isolated populations with low genetic diversity persist with focus on a subspecies of cutthroat trout: the greenback cutthroat. The greenback cutthroat, despite being Colorado?s state fish, was nearly extirpated and has been reduced to a single surviving population and a handful of reintroduced populations founded from that one population. This project seeks to compare genetic diversity between greenback cutthroat and a close relative at the landscape and population levels and then link those data with the ability for recovery populations in new habitats. The project leverages a past experiment in which the two subspecies were crossed to identify genomic features that contribute to fitness and boost the genetic diversity of greenback cutthroat without swamping the genetic features that are specific to the subspecies. The project will also bring these methods into the classroom at a local minority serving college to help train students in these cutting-edge technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to link the genetic basis of phenotypic traits to their interaction with the environment for a genetically depauperate and isolated fish. This research will provide a predictive framework in which genomic features identified with whole-genome sequencing at three ecological and demographic scales are linked to individual fitness. First, it will assess standing genetic variation in two subspecies, the greenback and the closely related Colorado River cutthroat trout, and identify loci correlated with key environmental features using genetic-environmental analyses. It will then focus on recently reintroduced populations to measure how genetic diversity at introduction predicts the populations persistence via phenotypic plasticity or rapid adaptation. Lastly, genomic data from the two subspecies and their hybrids will be used to identify loci associated with inbreeding load and negative fitness in greenback cutthroat. These data will inform how genetic variation and environmental attributes manifest as individual fitness and the relative ability of each subspecies to adapt to changing conditions as a function of genetic diversity. Finally, the Fellow will lead both field and bench modules at a local, minority serving institution with the goal of introducing skills beneficial to career development and in pursuit of advanced degrees in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Aerial locomotion, such as gliding, has evolved repeatedly across the tree of life. Gliding behavior is often facilitated by the presence of patagia: flappy, membranous structures which allow the organism to slow and control their descent through the air. Although these features have evolved numerous times, little is known about their developmental origins. The core aim of this fellowship is to determine how membranous structures, such as those found in gliding organisms or in pathologies, are formed. The Fellow will characterize patagium development in gecko lizards, which have evolved gliding behavior and membranes several times. By characterizing development from the tissue level to the genomic level, the Fellow aims to uncover genes and pathways required for the formation of gliding membranes. The Fellow will also reach diverse audiences by involving early undergraduate students at the hosting institution in research as well performing public outreach through institutions like the Milwaukee Public Museum.<br/><br/>Using histology, apoptosis assays, and cell proliferation assays, the Fellow will characterize the tissue composition and cellular activity of developing patagia in two species of gecko to determine if convergently evolved gecko patagia are the result of convergent or divergent cellular and developmental patterns. To identify candidate genes and regulatory pathways which result in patagium outgrowth, the Fellow will characterize the transcriptional and regulatory landscape of embryonic patagium formation using RNAseq and ATACseq. The Fellow will experimentally inhibit candidate genes and pathways to test their function in patagium development. Collectively, this research provides a foundation for the study of membrane formation in lizards, specifically, and vertebrates, broadly. Generated morphological and sequence data will be made publicly available. This fellowship will also facilitate training the Fellow in genomic and developmental genetic techniques as well as mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in evolutionary developmental biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Microscopic algae called snow algae thrive in snow-covered alpine ecosystems worldwide. Snow algae cells have red pigments, and blooms of snow algae darken the snow surface and accelerate snowmelt. Snow-covered mountains around the world provide a critical supply of water, so understanding how snow algae impact snowmelt is important for global water security. This research aims to determine how the productivity (photosynthesis rates) and biomass of snow algae communities in alpine ecosystems is linked to their genetic and life cycle diversity, and to environmental factors such as temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This research will allow scientists to determine the impacts of climate change on snow algal communities and predict how snow algae will impact snowmelt in alpine ecosystems in the future. Key components of this project will include engagement with local communities through the Living Snow Project, and broadening participation in science through mentorship of students underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This research will determine how multiple components of biodiversity (interspecific and life cycle diversity), together with environmental conditions (seasonality, temperature, light, and carbon dioxide levels), shape the primary productivity and biomass of snow algae communities. This project has three primary aims: (1) quantify variation in genetic diversity (using amplicon sequencing of taxonomic genes), life cycle diversity (using microscopy), and phenotypic traits of snow algal communities (photophysiology, carbon fixation and cellular respiration rates) across the spring and summer growing season at field sites in the North Cascades of Washington; (2) test the physiological and transcriptional responses of snow algal communities to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the lab; and (3) synthesize results from aims 1 and 2 to parameterize predictive models of snow algae impacts to bioalbedo and snowmelt in alpine ecosystems. The fellow will gain invaluable training in alpine ecosystem fieldwork techniques, transcriptomic sequencing, data analysis, and inclusive pedagogical practices. Throughout the fellowship period, the fellow will broaden participation in science by mentoring students underrepresented in the sciences on snow algae research projects, and by peer education to other postdoctoral researchers through a zoom-based inclusive pedagogy in STEM workshop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The vibrant colors of bird feathers and eggs have long fascinated biologists who have largely focused on their importance in social signals. However, variation in plumage and egg color among bird species is often associated with habitat and ecological differences, suggesting that the environment plays a strong role in driving the evolution of avian color traits. The project focuses on the weaver family (Ploceidae), which includes more than 100 species found in a wide variety of habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, with individual species exhibiting unique combinations of feather and egg colors. The fellow will integrate color, environmental, and genetic data and use a novel approach to study evolutionary patterns of egg and plumage color in tandem. In doing so, the research will expand the fields of ecology and evolution by considering the role that coloration plays in allowing species to adapt to their environments and determine whether eggs and feathers evolve together. The fellowship will facilitate research and professional development opportunities for students from universities and colleges in the greater Los Angeles area, many of which are primarily minority serving. <br/>Within a biological context, coloration is a mediator between an organism and its environment and can play important roles in factors such as social signaling, thermoregulation, and antipredator defense. Comparative studies of avian coloration have demonstrated that it is subject to natural (e.g., camouflage) and sexual selection (e.g., prezygotic barrier). However, how various selective pressures interact with genes and the environment to produce color diversity remains poorly understood. The project will combine: 1) phenotypic data from eggs and plumage collected from museum specimens of weaver species; 2) georeferenced occurrence data of weaver species from which environmental variables will be extracted; and 3) whole genomes generated during the fellow?s Ph.D. which will be used to conduct comparative phylogenomic analyses of egg and feather color traits. Using digital imaging techniques, the project will also be the first family-level study to compare feather microstructures among species, potentially leading to the discovery of new color-generating mechanisms in feathers beyond pigments. To broaden the impact of the research the fellow will: 1) provide research opportunities for undergraduates related to the project; 2) participate in museum outreach events; 3) run Leadership in STEM summer workshop series geared towards early-career scientists. These combined activities seek to increase public engagement and retention of students in STEM fields from diverse backgrounds and highlight the critical role that museums play in acting as an interface between scientists and the local community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. European green crabs (Carcinus maenas) are one of the world?s most successful marine invasive species, due in part to their ability to thrive across a range of temperatures. On the North American West Coast, invasive green crabs negatively impact species important for commercial shellfish production and tribal food sovereignty through competition with native crabs, predation of juvenile shellfish, and destruction of nursery eelgrass beds. In order to accurately predict and prevent further spread and damages, it is important to understand the factors that help this species tolerate temperature changes. This work will uncover how genetic and environmental factors contribute to an individual crab?s temperature tolerance. The fellow will expand on previous justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion work by developing lessons about genetics and marine invasions for under-resourced schools in the Greater Boston area. <br/><br/>West Coast C. maenas populations are characterized by substantially lower genetic diversity than in their native range. Recent discovery of a supergene (block of genes inherited together) with amino acid-changing mutations strongly associated with thermal tolerance suggests a genetic basis for C. maenas thermotolerance at a population level. While population-level differences in thermal performance are important, they can obscure the individual variation in phenotypically plastic traits that influences thermotolerance. The fellow will pair whole-animal thermal physiology, transcriptomics, and metabolomics in adult C. maenas to disentangle thermal response variation associated with acclimatory plasticity and adaptive evolution. By leveraging the mechanistic understanding provided by high-throughput sequencing technologies such as untargeted transcriptomics and metabolomics, the fellow will elucidate impacts of temperature on molecular physiology that may not be easily observed by whole-organism response metrics alone. Molecular reprogramming identified by these methods will demonstrate how individual-level thermotolerance contributes to population stress responses. This research will quantify individual thermal tolerance variation and create a framework for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of plasticity-adaptation interactions. The methods can be applied to other systems, and will expand the fellow?s research breadth. The fellow will providing paid research opportunities for undergraduate students from historically excluded groups in ocean sciences, thus training students in ecophysiology and molecular biology while also developing mentorship skills necessary for the fellow to be a successful professor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One hypothesis is that gene exchange between different species, or hybridization, could bring foreign genes into the gene pool and boost the variation available for evolution. This research will test the role of hybridization in providing the raw material for evolution in a diverse tribe of sunflowers called the rock daisies (Perityleae) found in mountains, islands, and deserts in North and South America. The research will develop statistical tools to understand when hybrids have formed during the recent radiation of the rock daisies using genetics, morphology, and ecology. In documenting the mechanisms generating diversity in this group, the fellow will gain valuable training in hybridization studies and bioinformatics as well as developing teaching modules for free dissemination about how we can better preserve biodiversity for future generations. <br/><br/>Hybridization may play a fundamental role during evolutionary radiations through two pathways: by seeding variation via hybridization at the onset (the hybrid origins hypothesis) and by generating variability through reticulation among members of a radiating clade (the syngameon hypothesis). The fellow will test these hypotheses during the radiation of the rock daisies at three scales in which shifts into new adaptive zones occurred. At the sub genome level, the fellow will test whether hybridization arose prior to trans-oceanic dispersal to Guadalupe Island in an allopolyploid island endemic plant (Nesothamnus incanus). At the population level, the fellow will investigate whether hybrid origins of South American rock daisies boosted variation prior to long-distance dispersal, facilitating intercontinental invasion success. In a diverse clade of interest, the fellow will integrate microevolutionary and macroevolutionary data from 57 taxa in the genus Laphamia into a time calibrated framework to reconstruct the dynamics of hybridization, genetic differentiation, and morphological disparification during a biome shift into the North American Deserts. The fellow will gain valuable training in phylogenetic methods and international interdisciplinary collaboration. To broaden participation in science, the fellow will undergraduates, develop bilingual teaching modules in English and Spanish, and distribute novel tools to fellow researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the threat of global climate change, it is important to understand how animals respond and evolve when faced with rapid changes in their environments. Phenotypic plasticity, which occurs when an individual adjusts its physiology in response to environmental conditions, can help animals deal with increasing temperatures. When animals face a high degree or variable amount of environmental change, they may evolve an increased capability for plasticity. Further, microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, etc.) that live in animal gastrointestinal tracts can influence animal physiology and could impact their host?s ability to respond to changing environments. In this project, the Fellow will monitor evolution in heat tolerance plasticity of anole lizards after recent and rapid increases to the temperature of their environment. Additionally, the Fellow will determine if microbial communities in the gut have facilitated aspects of this adaptation. This research will help elucidate how interactions between hosts and microbes shape organismal responses to changing climates, which may help protect vulnerable species. The Fellow will also work to disseminate scientific findings to the public while mentoring undergraduate students from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM disciplines on independent research projects.<br/><br/>This project will leverage an ongoing field evolution experiment in which Panamanian slender anole lizards have been transplanted from cool, mainland environments, to island environments which are often significantly warmer than the mainland, ancestral population. In this system, the Fellow will determine whether lizards in the warmest and most thermally variable island environments have evolved a greater capacity for heat tolerance plasticity compared to lizards in cooler environments. Further, the Fellow will determine if bacterial taxa in the gut are associated with increased host heat tolerance plasticity and if probiotic inoculations of these bacteria increase lizard plasticity and fitness in warm island environments. As a result of this project, the Fellow will gain expertise in field-based evolutionary and ecological experiments, physiology, microbiology, and computational biology. The Fellow will also mentor undergraduate researchers in the United States and Panama while assisting them in presenting their work on a popular live-action science show which is viewed by a large and diverse international audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) near Lima, Perú has been providing high-quality observations of these phenomena and the associated plasma processes for 60 years. JRO is owned and operated by the Peruvian Geophysical Institute (Instituto Geofísico del Perú) with support from an award from the Geospace Facilities program at NSF to Cornell University.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Alayna Mead is ""Leveraging genomic and phenotypic data to characterize local adaptation to drought across the range of a model tree species."" The host institution for the fellowship is Pennsylvania State University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Jill Hamilton, Stephen Keller, and Matthew C. Fitzpatrick.<br/><br/>Trees are ecologically important species that shape ecosystems, and carbon sequestration is among the many benefits they provide to people. The health and persistence of trees is threatened by climate change, particularly by the more frequent and severe droughts that are already occurring in parts of North America and are predicted to increase. Because trees are long-lived and can only shift their range through the movement of seeds and growth of new individuals, their response to changing climates is likely to be slow. However, not all trees within a species will respond to climate change in the same way: for example, trees that come from drier areas may be naturally more drought-tolerant because they have adapted to the local climate. Identifying genetic variation that makes individual trees more or less drought tolerant will enable us to predict which populations are more at risk, and develop management strategies to conserve them. This project will focus on Black Cottonwood, or Populus trichocarpa, a tree native to the western United States and Canada that is ecologically, scientifically, and economically important. This project will train the Fellow in a range of skills that will be broadly useful in forest genomics and conservation, including measurement of drought-related traits in the field and analysis of genomic data. In addition, the Fellow will mentor undergraduate students from multiple universities, with a particular focus on providing training in coding and bioinformatics to students without previous experience in these areas.<br/><br/>Understanding the genetic basis of climate-related traits is important in order to identify genotypes or populations that will be maladapted or well-adapted to future climate, and to devise management plans to conserve species. This project will focus on identifying alleles involved in drought tolerance in Populus trichocarpa, a model tree species. Previous work in P. trichocarpa has been able to identify genes involved in climate adaptation among populations. However, sampling in the southern part of the range has generally been sparse, despite these populations occurring in drier environments and potentially harboring more genetic variation than the better-studied northern populations. This project will use two whole-genome datasets to identify alleles that likely confer drought adaptation in P. trichocarpa. First, in conjunction with the PopUp Poplars Project, drought-related traits will be measured in common gardens that include P. trichocarpa and P. balsamifera hybrids, and alleles that are associated with variation in these drought tolerance traits will be identified using a genome-wide association analysis. Second, using a dataset of P. trichocarpa individuals collected across California as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project, this project will use a genotype-environment association analysis to identify alleles that are associated with local water availability in the southern, drier part of the species range. Additionally, candidate genes will be used to predict how P. trichocarpa will respond to climate change across its range, and to identify genotypes that are likely to be well-adapted to drought and would be ideal for restoration efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Birds inhabit nearly all land environments, yet were long thought to make limited use of their sense of smell. Recent behavioral work in birds has shown important roles for smell in behavior and ecology. Vertebrates detect odors using proteins called olfactory receptors (ORs).  The fellow has earlier shown that birds have many more ORs than previously realized. There are no studies in birds that match odors to ORs, and it is unknown which odors are important in bird ecology. However, researchers have matched mammalian ORs to specific odors. In many cases, these mammalian ORs are closely related to bird ORs. This research will test these closely related bird ORs with the same odors that the mammalian ORs detect, to understand how conserved OR function is between mammals and birds. This research will also test OR response to odors relevant to bird behavior, including oils from the gland birds use for preening. Additionally, outreach projects will show bird watchers the importance of smell to their local species. The fellow hopes to change the historical perception of bird smell and show that this is an important sense birds use to perceive the world.<br/><br/>This project will use a set of mouse ORs known to respond to specific odorants that are orthologous to zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) ORs to test in vivo if odorant responses are preserved through the evolution of these two highly divergent vertebrate lineages.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Cells are typically described as the smallest unit or ?building blocks? of biology, but cells often display sophisticated internal structures that enable specialized functions. Broadly, this research aims to address how cells build themselves by determining the processes involved in the assembly of highly complex features. Specifically, this study will investigate the elaborate internal structures of stinging cells, explosive cells used by cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, corals) in prey-capture and defense. The focus will be how different stinging cell types are assembled in the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. By teasing apart the precise mechanisms that shape the internal features of stinging cells, this project will lend to a better understanding of how complexity can arise and evolve in living systems. Furthermore, the project will enable complementary training in mentorship of undergraduates in the laboratory, public engagement across multiple venues, and implementation of science communication workshops for early-career researchers.<br/><br/>The self-organizational processes that result in complex cellular architecture includes both self-assembling protein-protein interactions and genomic regulation through altered gene expression. To establish a framework for how these molecular interactions shape intricate cellular features, this project will use the assembly of nematocysts as a model system. Nematocysts are cnidarian-specific projectile organelles housed in stinging cells that display diverse morphological types, yet they retain a conserved set of structural components that form specific subcellular features (e.g. barbs, spines, tubule). The focus of this research will be to disentangle the molecular and regulatory dynamics that contribute to the production of distinct subcellular features in different nematocyst types by integrating proteomics and protein-protein interaction network analyses, single-cell sequencing, high-resolution imaging, and functional genomic tools. While the project predominantly utilizes the sea anemone Nematostella, the coral Montipora will also be studied to compare the self-organizing processes of similar nematocyst types in two species. This project will include mentoring undergraduates in independent research as well as engaging with the public through an educational social media campaign and in-person community events. Science communication workshops will be designed and conducted at the host institution to train early-career researchers on how to communicate basic research to a K-12 audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. It is common for animals of the same species to look and act differently from one another. This is surprising because members of the same species share most of their genes. Scientists seek to understand how genes and the environment affect this variation. However, few studies have focused on how genes can affect trait variation, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes all at once. This project aims to understand how variation in genes in male Steelhead trout affects female evolution, population growth, and ecosystem processes. The results will affect salmon conservation. The project will also broaden participation in science through the Fellow?s mentorship in programs serving first-generation and Hispanic undergraduates.<br/><br/>The specific research goals of this project are to (1) quantify how the genetic architecture underlying male alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in Steelhead trout affects female life history, fecundity, and fitness, (2) determine the degree to which sex-specific effects of ART genotypes resolve intralocus conflict over length and age at maturity, (3) model how selection on male ARTs might affect female evolution and population growth rate, and (4) project how selection on ARTs and the resulting changes in genetic variation, body size, and population growth alter freshwater ecosystem processes such as nutrient transfer and sediment transport. Together, these objectives will comprise a model for predicting how genes underlying a trait with sex-specific variation can affect the evolution of the other sex, as well as population dynamics and ecosystem function. The model will be applicable to other salmonid systems and, more broadly, to any species with genetic variation for sex-specific ARTs. Career development activities for the Fellow will include attending conferences to present findings, writing and publishing scientific manuscripts, and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students through the Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-Based Opportunities (CAMINO) and Doris Duke Scholars programs at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

George Zheng of the University of Georgia is investigating new molecular mechanisms of life process regulation by novel post-translational modification of proteins. Specific chemical modifications in proteins can impact key attributes and functions of affected proteins, such as structural conformation, enzymatic activity, intracellular localization, and interaction with other biomolecules. Through fine-tuned post-translational modifications, cells and organisms adjust and regulate their physiological states in response to various internal and external stimuli. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of many post-translational modifications and their roles in regulating biological processes are incompletely understood.  This also highlights another key point; namely that there are likely a good number of post-translational modifications (PTMs) yet to be characterized. This project endeavors to advance  biological research field by identifying as yet unrecognized post-translational modifications and elucidating the mechanisms by which several of these PTMs regulate key life processes such as DNA transcription, cell cycle control, and signal transduction. Multidisciplinary methods and tools in the chemical and biological sciences will be explored and applied to identify, validate, and functionally annotate post-translational modifications in the human proteome. The proposed work is expected to support education and diversity,  consistent with the the principal investigator?s established record in the scientific training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds. Early career trainees will learn and apply state-of-the-art methods in chemical biology to address relevant questions in molecular signaling, thereby benefiting the chemical biology science community broadly.<br/><br/>In this project, a particular focus will be placed on identifying and validating two new post-translational modifications in human proteins that are derived from the key metabolites in the valine metabolic pathway. The researchers hypothesize that the reactive metabolite, methacrylyl-CoA, and/or its hydrolyzed product methacrylate, produced in valine metabolism are capable of modifying cellular proteins through two different biochemical mechanisms: acylation of specific lysine residues (lysine methacrylylation) and alkylation of specific cysteine residues (S-2-carboxypropylation). Tailored chemical probes will be developed to specifically recognize and label lysine methacrylylation and cysteine S-2-carboxypropylation molecular modifications in proteins and peptides, and then be applied to set up chemoproteomic platforms to map out methacrylylated and S-2-carboxypropylated protein substrates at the proteomic level. Bioinformatics will be used to delineate the distribution and scope of lysine methacrylylation and cysteine S-2-carboxypropylation in the human proteome. Furthermore, cellular and biochemical experiments will be conducted to investigate dynamic controls and downstream effects of these protein modifications. This work is projected to expand understanding of valine metabolites and their contribution to protein posttranslational modification, and to a broader level, advance the tool kit for molecular-level understanding of the expressed human proteome and the role of PTMs in regulation and signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers, commonly referred to as plastics, are long-chain macromolecules that consist of predominantly carbon-carbon bonds. Plastics that can degrade in response to external stimuli are desirable for a variety of applications, including removable coatings, recyclable materials, and repairable electronics. Their degradation is typically enabled by the cleavage of degradable functional groups that are incorporated in the polymer backbone. However, degradable functional groups can also lead to stability issues as they can be triggered under ambient conditions. This project will encompass the design and synthesis of a family of polymers that address the stability issues by introducing ?locking? moieties to degradable polymers. A locking moiety will maintain the backbone integrity and mechanical properties of the polymer during storage and normal use of the materials. When degradation is needed, the locking moiety will be unlocked to enable stimuli-responsive degradation. From the sustainability point of view, the design principle associated with this project provides a very promising and viable solution to the current challenges associated with the widespread usage of non-degradable vinyl plastics. Hence, the developed methodology could be utilized to build readily degradable plastics that are amenable to a circular economy. This in turn could decrease demand for fossil fuels, such as oil, gas, and coal, which are the raw materials for over 99% of plastic commodity products. Since the refining of fossil fuels is intensive, a significant reduction in the emission of greenhouse gas could also be achieved. This project will provide training opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary area that integrates cutting-edge physical organic chemistry, organic and polymer synthesis, and mechanochemistry. The research will also ensure maximum opportunity for integrating science and education based on new course development, partnerships with high schools, and the involvement of underrepresented groups. Outreach activities will focus on developing recruiting relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Ohio and preparing an exhibition ?Polymers and Life? in collaboration with Akron Children?s Museum. <br/><br/>This project will focus on the design and synthesis of a class of polymers that can undergo a two-step degradation fashion: mechanochemical activation followed by degradation. This degradation mechanism will allow the degradation of the polymers to be controlled by mechanical force and will improve overall polymer stability while retaining optimal physical properties. In the first objective, the reactivity of the mechanophores will be tuned through substituent effects, stereochemistry, regiochemistry, and sidechain effects. This approach will provide mechanochemical structure?activity relationships that can guide the design and development of next-generation stimuli-responsive functional polymers. The second objective will focus on diverse degradation responses, including multi-stimuli responsive degradation, catalytic depolymerization, and chemically amplified degradation.

The objective will be to build a diverse team of graduate students, undergraduate researchers, and high school interns, whose collective efforts uncover how polymers interact with electronically active surfaces and synergistically enhance the optical, electronic, and photoactive properties of the hybrid structure as a whole.  The research in this project will in turn educate the participants in vital areas of chemistry where new discoveries are needed to advance the chemical sciences beyond what is known today.  Direct implications of this project point towards producing advanced devices, such as solar cells, that are more efficient when the polymers synthesized in this project are used in conjunction with semiconductor particles/surfaces.  Importantly, this project will enable new summer research opportunities that promote inclusion of diverse participants who are entering the formative stages of their STEM education.  A seamless merger of the research with education, diversity, and gender equity objectives will contribute to our mission of ensuring that the future of U.S. global competitiveness in science and technology advances the areas of electronic and solar devices, which are key elements of clean energy and advanced technologies.  Moreover, the project will couple cross-cutting educational activities with student exposure to industrial interactions, which will maintain awareness of current needs and opportunities of sustainable technologies at the forefront of the project. <br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, this proposal will design macromolecular/nanoscale hybrid systems that are envisaged to exploit new discoveries of polymer-based ligands to promote specific surface interactions with inorganic semiconductor structures.

Peer reviews, in which students have the opportunity to analyze and evaluate projects made by their classroom peers, are a widely acknowledged pedagogical method for engaging students and have become a standard practice in undergraduate education. Peer review is most often used in classes with large number of students to provide timely feedback on student assignments. However, peer review has benefits far beyond scalability. Peer review gathers diverse feedback, raises students? comfort level with having their work evaluated in a professional setting, and most importantly, the action of giving a peer review is often more valuable than receiving a peer review. The software platforms in current use that support peer review have seen limited innovation in recent decades, and potential improvements to enhance student outcomes have not been thoroughly evaluated. This project plans to develop and study an innovative peer review system that uses behavioral nudges, a method of subtlety reinforcing positive habits, to improve the evaluation skills of students and the quality of the feedback they provide in peer reviews.<br/><br/>This project proposes to 1) create a software system supporting peer review that includes behavioral nudges for guiding the peer review process to hone students? evaluation and critical analysis skills and 2) study how the use of behavioral nudges improves student engagement. The approach will be evaluated using four different visualization courses that serve approximately 800 students per year. Two groups of students will be studied. The control group will utilize peer review with additional feedback modalities but no nudges, while the test group will use peer review with the same feedback modalities but also include nudges. Common statistical tests such as, ANOVA, t-tests, and correlations, will be used to validate the results. The resulting system could provide a significant and measurable improvement in outcomes in courses that utilize peer review across different STEM disciplines. The resulting technologies will be disseminated as open source to enable widespread adoption.

Matching markets establish a principled framework for distributing goods, services, and information among interested parties---humans, institutions, nations, or autonomous agents---in a robust and efficient manner. In many matching and resource allocation settings such as school choice, refugee placement, food donation, and ridesharing the use of monetary transfers is prohibited, or simply infeasible, due to ethical, societal, or legal concerns. The broad objective of this project is developing a theoretically grounded approach for robust fairness in practical and large-scale allocation markets through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), economics, and computation. In particular, this research addresses fairness issues that arise due to uncertain or incomplete information, dynamic nature of markets, complex constraints, and strategic behavior of participating entities that influence the outcome. This project will lead to the creation of novel fair and efficient AI systems across practical domains such as federated healthcare and gig economies. This project will also lay the foundation for implementing fair systems for matching students to advisors, assigning mentors to mentees, and conference scheduling in a principled and robust manner. It will integrate allocation solutions through a publicly accessible software platform to foster the adoption of sound fair solutions in everyday decision-making, and will curate a valuable learning resource to reach the public and practitioners beyond academia and educators.<br/><br/>This project makes a systematic effort in designing novel fair AI systems by bridging the gap between the fields of matching theory and fair division and enabling the creation of new approximate algorithms. It aims at making advances in the following interconnected directions: (i) Matching and allocation under uncertain/noisy preferences, that aims at devising fair solutions that are robust to uncertainty or noise in preference information, (ii) Fairness and diversity in dynamic matching, that combines techniques from online matching and fair division to develop solutions that provide robust fairness and diversity guarantees in dynamic markets, and (iii) Incentives and fairness in two-sided markets, that provides a systematic approach to blend techniques from stable matching markets with recent advances in fair division to design robust solutions in the presence of strategic behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deductive verification generates mathematical proof obligations from software specifications, and, when these proof obligations are met, software implementations are guaranteed to conform to the specifications from which they were generated. Generated obligations can be discharged by means of hand-written mathematical proofs, but modern software is sufficiently complex that this is often tedious and error-prone, if not outright infeasible. Increasingly, therefore, proofs are developed in proof assistants like Agda, Coq, Idris, and Lean. Induction is one of the most important proof techniques available in such proof assistants. Indeed, almost all non-trivial proofs involving data types are either proved by induction outright or rely on lemmas that are. For this reason, every time a new data type is declared in, say, Coq, an induction rule is automatically generated for it. But because they traverse only the top layer, rather than all of the layers of a data structure, there are some properties of data types that should be amenable to induction but that the structural induction rules generated by Coq cannot prove. Deep induction is a recently developed generalization of structural induction that does indeed induct over all of the data present in data structures. This project's novelty is that it extends deep induction from the algebraic data types (ADTs) and (truly) nested types typically handled by Coq to their more expressive generalizations known as generalized ADTs (GADTs) and inductive families (IFs). The project's impact is thus to make it possible to detect errors and verify program properties that cannot be expressed just using ADTs and nested types, but that can be expressed using GADTs and IFs.<br/><br/>The project involves developing a principled, conceptually simple, uniform, and comprehensive framework for deep induction for GADTs and IFs, including: i) a grammar that generates a very general class of GADTs, including all those from the literature; ii) a novel endofunctor initial-algebra-like semantics for GADTs that justifies their deep induction rules; iii) translations between GADTs and IFs that yield similar semantics, and thus deep induction rules, for IFs; and iv) implemented tools that generate deep induction rules for GADTs and IFs, together with witnesses that prove them correct, directly from their syntax. Overall, the project applies state-of-the-art theory to improve state-of-the-art verification practice. Theoretically, endofunctor initial algebra semantics is one of the cornerstones of the theory of data types, and is key to deriving even structural induction rules for them. A particularly compelling feature of the project's framework for deep induction is that the novel ""maximally functorial interpretations"" of GADTs and IFs that serve as its foundation are based on the same well-established principles as, and indeed specialize to, the standard initial algebra semantics for ADTs and nested types. It thus delivers a uniform semantics for ADTs, (truly) nested types, GADTs, and IFs, as well as a uniform methodology for deriving their deep induction rules. Practically speaking, this makes it possible to incorporate deep induction for GADTs and IFs into modern proof assistants by conservatively extending the standard induction techniques currently in use for ADTs, rather than by developing fundamentally new approaches. Even incorporating deep induction just for ADTs into existing proof assistants will significantly extend and improve them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such environments often have strategic participants who are aware that their data will be used by a platform designer to make future decisions. When participants anticipate these decisions, they may change their behavior; a consumer may wait for a coupon to purchase, and a contractor may start their price high to facilitate later negotiations. Strategic manipulation in turn necessitates new learning algorithms which interpret the data correctly and use it carefully. The applications of interest range from e-commerce and managerial decision-making, where firms optimize operations from data, to the design of the social safety net, where the selection of recipients impacts the livelihoods of the most economically vulnerable. The end goal is theoretical conclusions that can guide both designers of and regulators for such systems.<br/><br/>The standard theory of online learning is insufficient in settings with strategic concerns. A designer now needs to control a subtle feedback loop: the way data will be used dictates what data will be provided in the first place. It is additionally important to understand which learning algorithms are stable when the learner can change their algorithm in response to the data. To tackle these issues, this project seeks to use and expand on techniques from data privacy in computer science and the theory of dynamic games in economics. The research will apply these tools in two primary ways. The first is comparative: understanding many distinct applications will highlight the structural features that help or hinder algorithmic learning. These include standard economic models from contract theory and delegation, pricing, and targeting of social benefits. The second approach is to apply the insights from the comparative analysis to design new systems.

At the same time, education and existing tools still require computer programmers to have deep knowledge of both low-level hardware considerations and higher-level application logic.  Higher levels of program abstraction are more tractable for humans and automated program improvement methods because they separate algorithm logic from implementation details, while lower 'near-hardware' levels of abstraction are difficult for humans to understand and optimize because of the many crucial architectural and hardware details that often interact with application-level logic in non-trivial ways. The project addresses this gap by developing automated methods for near-hardware run-time optimization of programs, bug repair, and creation of new programs.  It includes an evaluation featuring interactive human evaluations, which studies human interactions with the project's automated tools along several dimensions.<br/><br/>The project aims to improve the automation of software engineering tasks for near-hardware domains. This requires addressing fundamental questions such as: What representations span multiple levels of abstraction? How can one analyze and select optimizations respecting both hardware and software constraints for real-world applications? How can a tool communicate its results to users who may lack expertise in either domain-specific architecture or hardware-specific details?

For many rural students, majors and careers in STEM fields are undesirable and not encouraged. Research shows that early interventions to shape the perception of STEM to students as early as middle school by developing a sense of belonging can shift the interest of students in technical careers specifically and STEM generally. This project will address technician workforce needs by increasing the number and diversity of students who are interested in entering career and technical education majors and ultimately technician careers in high-tech STEM fields. The Santa Fe College Technician Education programs include: Air Conditioning and Refrigeration, Automotive, Biotechnology, Building Construction, Computer Networking, Computer Programming and Analysis, Information Systems, Plumbing, and Welding. The project will leverage lessons learned from the Upward Bound summer camp pilot to adapt and implement the Guitar, Robotics, and Rocketry curriculum as a Summer Institute program to attract students to these technician career fields before they graduate high school.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to increase the quantity of students from rural regions and from groups underrepresented in STEM entering technician careers in high-tech STEM fields. This goal will be accomplished through five objectives: 1) Adapt and format curriculum to enhance college preparation mathematics for the Summer Institutes ; 2) Provide faculty, staff, and local secondary school educators professional development to ensure consistent implementation of the curriculum and pedagogical models; 3) Host Summer Institutes at the College?s five educational centers over the project lifetime; 4) Evaluate the effectiveness of project outcomes through a validated pre/post attitude and career interest survey, pre/post comparison of math skills, and follow-up interviews; and 5) Engage local employers in the development of technician career exploration presentations and/or videos. The project will collaborate with community partners including Upward Bound (UB), College Achievement Program (CAP), SF Achieve, and two University of Central Florida and Children?s Home Society Community Partnership Schools (CPS) to recruit students and to provide year-round support for student development. Collaboration with the Florida Local Alliance for Math Literacy and Equity (FLAME) will provide guidance in strengthening the math skills of project participants. Curriculum adaptation will be based on pedagogical practices designed to combat stereotype threats and enhance self-efficacy. Local employers will provide expertise for curriculum improvement based on industry needs and provide information about technician career opportunities and educational requirements for those careers. The project results will be disseminated through project presentations and publications and will be shared with project partners. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep learning methods currently achieve the best performance in important problems such as facial recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and machine translation and have also been used in scientific problems in space weather, molecular biology, chemistry, and the health sciences. Despite this success, deep-learning methods are still widely viewed as black boxes, where their decisions are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, there is little mathematical understanding about how to design an effective deep neural network. This project will advance this understanding by investigating how the geometry of the data can be used to better understand and improve deep-learning design strategies. These advances will lead to improved performance in deep learning in scientific fields with large societal impact such as medicine, public health, molecular biology, and chemistry. The research project also involves the mentoring of doctoral students and the material generated from the project will be incorporated into multiple courses on data science.<br/> <br/>In this project, the team of researchers will develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for harnessing data geometry, graphs, and invariance to enhance performance and interpretability for a wide scope of deep learning problems. This will include investigating the effects of neural network transformations on the data geometry, which is captured by applying manifold learning at different layers in the neural network. New metrics will be designed to empirically test invariance relative to a symmetry group at different layers. These metrics will be used to drive a data-augmentation process that maximizes the learned invariance of the neural network during training. Methods for detecting hidden invariances in data will also be developed that can be used to analyze the neural network training process. By investigating these problems, this project will provide deep-neural-network design guidelines that will lead to a new generation of deep learning that moves beyond heuristics and ensures that a neural network is designed to ensure accuracy, robustness, and interpretability for the learning task.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Craig of Duke University will develop a class of metal-containing polymers that respond with chemical changes under mechanical stress. Common techniques in the manufacturing of household plastics can be modified to prepare these polymers.  Mechanical stress is a nearly ubiquitous feature of the environment experience by polymers. The translation of mechanical stress to responsive chemistry may provide new pathways to open up applications such as catalysis and advanced materials. This work has the potential to develop synthetic polymers that are mechanically responsive and thermally stable, both of which are important for reusability and recyclability of most commodity polymers.  The impact of this work will be further broadened through its close integration with both new and existing outreach programs and educational activities at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate student level. These programs are enriched by partnerships with American Chemical Society Project SEED summer research program, ACS polymer student chapter, and local Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Joint research exchanges will be offered to participating students at UofSC and Duke to enhance their research experiences and expand future career paths.  <br/><br/>This project is focused on developing synthetic approaches toward main-chain metallocene-containing polymers and studying their mechanochemical reactivity.  Metallocenes have recently emerged as a new class of mechanophores. The research aims to consolidate the evolving knowledge of mechanochemistry and expand it to new frontiers of research through the collaborative efforts using synthetic metallocene chemistry and polymer mechanochemistry. Catalytic chemistry will be explored for C-H functionalization and redox isomerization via the formation half-sandwich metal complexes. Sensitization of metallocene mechanophores will be further achieved in metallocenophane macrocycles by combining distal conformational locks and counterion assistance and quantifying their interplay on reactivity through single molecule force spectroscopy. Importantly, constructive mechanochemistry will be pursued by using reconstructive processes to make the activation of metallocenes reversible and by employing DFT calculations to elucidate thermodynamic equilibria between dissociated states and sandwich constructs.

Synthesis holds the promise of easing the burden on programmers (e.g., by finding solutions to tricky special cases automatically), and allowing non-programmers to create programs merely by indicating the outcome that they want the program to produce. Unfortunately, current synthesis tools do not scale up to large-scale programming problems, a situation that threatens to doom this promising technology to being a niche field. This project's novelties are ways to exploit compositionality in program synthesis in a way that allows one to create bigger programs out of smaller ones.<br/><br/>The project builds on a recent framework called SemGuS (Semantics-Guided Synthesis), which offers a foothold on the expressibility and scalability problems of program synthesis. In principle, the framework can support the synthesis of software in layers, where implementation choices in one layer are hidden from other layers (and thus consistent with modular software design with information hiding). The goal of the project is to capitalize on the opportunity that SemGuS offers for extending synthesis to much larger systems than was possible heretofore. The work will lead to more scalable and general synthesis algorithms, with potential benefits to synthesis applications that are already in widespread use. Further development of the SemGuS framework has the potential to make synthesis more usable and programmable, and thereby allow users to carry out synthesis tasks without prior knowledge of existing synthesis tools. Most importantly, compositional synthesis will allow synthesis to scale to larger applications with more practical relevance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Success in that niche hinges on fostering a rich ecosystem of highly-optimized mathematical libraries. The Julia language is predicated on the bet that its users can write efficient numerical code without having to resort to C or Fortran. Julia programmers strive to write code that will be compiled with predictable performance. In particular, they believe that, for performance-critical sections, the high-level abstractions provided by the language will melt into code equivalent (or close enough) to what one would have written in a performance language like C. There is an inherent tension between the need for predictable speed and the desire of developers to write generic and reusable high-level code. High-level code uses abstractions such as dynamic binding, generic types, and automatic memory management. Equipped with sufficient information about the expected behavior of a particular program, a compiler can indeed compile these abstractions down to efficient code.  Unfortunately, the kind of information needed for this is non-local, and it can be accrued either by whole-program static analysis or by feedback-directed speculative compilation. Either one is sensitive to small changes in the program. Programmers may thus not be able to predict how efficient their code will be without testing it extensively after each code change. To avoid this, the designers of Julia have included two novel features in their language design: world age and type stability. These features allow programmers to have greater confidence in their code, and are part of a dialogue between the compiler and programmers.  <br/><br/>This project's novelties are to formalize existing concepts in Julia  for predictable performance and to argue about their correctness. The project?s impacts are a better understanding of the language that can be leveraged by programmers and tool-builders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such environments often have strategic participants who are aware that their data will be used by a platform designer to make future decisions. When participants anticipate these decisions, they may change their behavior; a consumer may wait for a coupon to purchase, and a contractor may start their price high to facilitate later negotiations. Strategic manipulation in turn necessitates new learning algorithms which interpret the data correctly and use it carefully. The applications of interest range from e-commerce and managerial decision-making, where firms optimize operations from data, to the design of the social safety net, where the selection of recipients impacts the livelihoods of the most economically vulnerable. The end goal is theoretical conclusions that can guide both designers of and regulators for such systems.<br/><br/>The standard theory of online learning is insufficient in settings with strategic concerns. A designer now needs to control a subtle feedback loop: the way data will be used dictates what data will be provided in the first place. It is additionally important to understand which learning algorithms are stable when the learner can change their algorithm in response to the data. To tackle these issues, this project seeks to use and expand on techniques from data privacy in computer science and the theory of dynamic games in economics. The research will apply these tools in two primary ways. The first is comparative: understanding many distinct applications will highlight the structural features that help or hinder algorithmic learning. These include standard economic models from contract theory and delegation, pricing, and targeting of social benefits. The second approach is to apply the insights from the comparative analysis to design new systems. The goal is to produce new algorithms for well-studied strategic environments, or understand how these environments can be modified by a government or firm to enable learning (or mitigate its harms).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response, households adopt water related activities and coping strategies aimed at maintaining the health of children and others in home. While children are often integral to these activities and strategies, current research focuses on an adult?s ability to maintain their own well-being. This leaves us with an incomplete and adult biased understanding of water insecurity. The purpose of this doctoral dissertation is to examine how children experience and perceive their daily routines and well-being to be impacted by household water insecurity. In addition to training a graduate student in anthropological science, the project has implications for public health (local and global), as policy and intervention are poorly informed by a lack of child centered research on water insecurity. <br/><br/>Ecocultural Theory argues that children?s participation in daily structured routines is the single most important influence on their development. This project advances Ecocultural Theory by considering how severe resource limitations, such as water insecurity, shape child routines and impact child well being. Working with a group of 30 children, ages 6-11, and their parents, the research uses conversational semi-structured interviews, direct observations, and drawings to understand children?s roles and responsibilities related to the use, consumption, and management of water; what activities children engage in to address situations of insufficient or unsafe water; and how children perceive their well-being to be impacted by their water related roles, responsibilities, and coping strategies.

Typically, studies of ecological and evolutionary interactions focus on means of interaction metrics, although other aspects of distributions of those metrics, such as variance and skew, can also be critical for ecology and evolution. The Herbivory Variability Research Coordination Network will advance science by expanding thinking beyond a focus on means to include the causes and consequences of variability itself. To illustrate, variation in temperature and precipitation can be more important than averages to species performance and interactions. Less appreciated is that variation in the abundance of one species across space and time can drive the outcome of its interactions with other species and may even impact evolutionary trajectories. Understanding the role of variability in the ecology and evolution of species interactions is becoming increasingly important as climate change and biodiversity loss lead to increased environmental variability and decreased biological variability. The network will focus on herbivory because it is an ecologically and economically important interaction that is easy to measure, exhibits great variation within and among species, and is a key variable in many important ecological and evolutionary theories. The foundations developed for studying variability in herbivory, however, could be extended to better understand any type of species interactions. Because the causes and consequences of interaction variability relate to so many disciplines, the network will bring together ecologists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, statisticians, chemists, and other scientists to collaborate via working groups that tackle synthesis, theory, data, and education projects.This project will also afford research training opportunities. <br/><br/>This project will form a Research Coordination Network (The Herbivory Variability Network, ?HerbVar?), which will bring together scientists from across fields and career stages with the common goal of understanding the causes and consequences of interaction variability.

The structure will allow young students to meet scientists and provide graduate students an opportunity to communicate their work to a broader audience. <br/><br/>While the value of Diels?Alder ?click? chemistry in material synthesis is well-established, exploration of the strategy for constructing homopolymers using a single-component monomer system is almost completely unknown. Through the proposed studies, access to telechelic cyclopentadiene monomers that are otherwise impossible to prepare will become accessible. Furthermore, the development of the proposed reactions will broadly increase our fundamental understanding of this new approach that have important applications in many fields of chemistry. By developing a light-triggered approach to access cyclopentadiene, the new strategy will also provide the high-resolution spatial control over chemical functionalization required to pattern biomaterials and move beyond current state of the art. Altogether, the one- and two-component cyclopentadiene based materials will address a long-standing challenge of preparing homopolymers with a single component telechelic monomer, and serve as a valuable new addition to the arsenal of available Diels?Alder ?click? reactions for preparing functional biomaterials with spatial and temporal control. To accomplish this work, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) utilize on-demand, metal-free deprotection of norbornadiene with tetrazine to access and isolate cyclopentadiene based monomers for single-component Diels?Alder-based polymerization and (2) develop a photo-click platform based on photolabile norbornadiene?cyclopentadienone adducts for spatiotemporal introduction of cyclopentadiene in materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their size gives them unique properties, and the use of metallic nanoparticles has revolutionized several technological and industrial sectors. As a result, inadvertent human exposure rates to engineered metallic nanoparticles are increasing, generating the need to better understand their short- and long-term effects to ensure the public?s safety. This project will focus on utilizing a new imaging strategy that can offer important insights on how metallic nanoparticles behave in living systems. The imaging strategy is different than conventional imaging techniques in that it does not require an exogenous label to track metallic nanoparticles. Instead, the imaging strategy can detect and follow the metallic nanoparticles in a label-free manner by exploiting a luminescent signal that is generated from the metals that comprise the nanoparticles themselves. The imaging technique can offer real-time tracking of metallic nanoparticles to observe their physiological interactions while in circulation. The images generated will also be able to reveal where they ultimately reside in the body and determine if any toxic effects or morphological changes are resulting. Gaining an improved fundamental understanding of these biological interactions could 1) better discern the safety of metallic nanomaterials in living subjects, 2) lead to informing new environmental policies, 3) generate new disease targeting strategies with therapeutic metallic nanoparticles to improve patient outcome. Additionally, further development and assessment of this transformative imaging strategy could open new avenues of investigation throughout the nano-community to further exploit this unique imaging technique. Local Los Angeles high school students will be introduced to the physical concepts and imaging approaches utilized here and the various nanoparticle types encountered as environmental pollutants. The goals for the educational plan are to 1) generate enthusiasm and spark creativity among students from under-represented groups in the Los Angeles area by showing different ways that nanoparticles are used to solve problems and 2) introduce new imaging concepts to students that can allow them to watch where nanoparticles are located in the body.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to explore a new multiphoton luminescence imaging strategy and its ability to develop a deeper understanding of how metallic nanoparticles behave in living systems. Researchers have previously reported on specific endpoints of nanoparticle interactions studied in cell culture on a macroscopic scale, e.g., cellular stress, inflammatory or mutagenic responses, or biodistribution profiles observed in preclinical models. However, this does not give a complete or biologically accurate depiction of how nanomaterials behave in a dynamic living system. Metallic nanoparticle biodistribution has been previously studied, but their real-time dynamics in circulation and ultimate fate are poorly understood on the microscopic level. This research project addresses this critical need by using a new and innovative multiphoton luminescence microscopy imaging approach. Intravital microscopy (IVM) has emerged as a profound imaging modality for gaining insight into dynamic processes on the cellular and sub-cellular level and is particularly suitable for visualizing nanoparticles in real time. IVM has enabled observation of several fundamental nanoparticle processes such as extravasation, tumor accumulation, and blood elimination in real time within a living organism. A current problem is that most nanoparticles must be exogenously labeled with fluorophores for visualization with conventional single-photon IVM. As the fluorophore may dissociate from the nanoparticle, it is challenging to determine the true behavior of nanoparticles within the blood stream using this approach. This project will use a new label-free multiphoton luminescence imaging approach that was recently uncovered in the principal investigator?s (PI?s) lab to study the native behavior of metallic nanoparticles in mouse models. Intrinsic broad-band luminescence has previously been observed in noble metals under multiphoton excitation conditions but has yet to be applied successfully in vivo to track nanoparticles flowing within the vasculature in real time. Luminescent properties associated with metals have yet to be applied successfully in vivo to track nanoparticles flowing within the vasculature in real time. This underutilized intrinsic luminescence will be used to 1) track metallic nanoparticles flowing in the vasculature to assess their rates of clearance from blood, and 2) determine their toxicities on major organs where they ultimately reside by analyses of harvested tissues. This is an immensely powerful tool, as the intrinsic luminescence of metallic nanoparticles could finally give the research community the ability to follow native flow in the blood while providing dynamic physiological information and ultimately localizing their accumulation within tissues on a microscopic scale. Consumers may be inadvertently exposed to various metallic nanoparticles. The results generated from this project are meant to enable a better understanding of the cellular interactions taking place within the body and where these nanoparticles ultimately reside. This information will be important in determining how to better regulate these nanomaterials as new nano-enabled products are engineered. A multi-year outreach and educational training plan will be pursued that is closely integrated with the proposed research, emphasizing how people use and encounter nanomaterials day to day. High school students from underrepresented groups across the Los Angeles area will be introduced to nanoparticles and the imaging techniques utilized to study their interactions in the body. The PI will connect with a Hispanic serving institution in her hometown, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). UTRGV currently lacks Ph.D. curricula in STEM and this research opportunity will enable the participation of these students in this research lab, providing interaction with Ph.D. students. This will promote higher education paths for students who otherwise would not get exposed to these careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cofactors are generated in a unidirectional protein post-translational modification. They have biological significance because they instill catalytic function in some enzymes, such as galactose oxidase, and enhance the catalytic efficiency of other enzymes, such as thiol dioxygenases. However, the chemistry of the cofactor synthesis and how the Cys-Tyr cofactor contributes to catalysis are not well understood. The proposed research will focus on the elucidation of the mechanism by which the Cys-Tyr crosslink of the cofactor is formed in enzymes. The graduate and undergraduate students who are engaged in the research plan will learn how to determine protein structure through crystallography, advanced spectroscopies, and the rapidly developing technology of substitution of an amino acid in a protein with unnatural amino acids. They will also gain expertise in the study of catalytic function in proteins.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to understand the extraordinary stability of the one-electron oxidized free radical form of the Cys-Tyr cofactor in copper-dependent galactose oxidase. The proposed studies will seek to determine the radical spin density distributions of the copper center and aromatic residues in the active site of the enzyme and how these distributions affect proton/electron transfer during catalysis. The research is expected to generate insight into how the Cys-Tyr cofactor in human thiol dioxygenases facilitates catalysis by characterization of substrate-bound complexes and cofactor-bearing structures. These studies will leverage the demonstrated ability of the research team to genetically substitute targeted amino acids with noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). Although the strategic substitution minimally alters the target amino acid residue, it alters the electronic and chemical structure of the functional groups. The ncAA-containing enzyme variants and their reactions with different substrates will be studied using a combination of chemical, spectroscopic, and structural biology methods. These studies aim to provide insight into the irreversible, self-processing, C-S bond formation and the processes by which the radical is stabilized and the redox activity of the copper active site is tuned. Ultimately, the project sets out to contribute to addressing the fundamental challenge of predicting protein structure and function ways that are distinct from and synergistic with current, best-in-class, prediction methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In archeological theory, climate change or natural disasters have been blamed for the collapse of civilizations. Equally common, however, are instances in which polities in the ancient world adapted to or circumvented climatic extremes. Learning how ancient people dealt with severe climate phenomena can inform current and future responses to such crises. Archaeology is exceptionally positioned to unearth the long record of mutual interactions between human cultural practices and their environments. This project will examine ancient human resilience to climatic extremes at the archaeological site directly affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Since the mid-Holocene societies have experienced ENSO events that, when most powerful, transform ecological conditions, prompting heavy rainfall and flooding in some locations and severe drought in others. This project takes a community-engaged approach to excavation and analysis. Through hiring and training residents, distributing educational resources, offering recurring presentations at schools, and preparing cultural heritage exhibitions this project will provide long-term community benefits. In this way, archeological work will be made relevant to local people. This project aims to respect, record, and integrate Indigenous knowledge systems, broadening the vision of climate science to incorporate traditional and local knowledge. <br/><br/>Focusing on an area directly affected by ENSO events, this research investigates three resilient ways in which people integrated ENSO-related changes into their social and ecological systems. First, in the local dimension residents had access to various ecological niches, including floodplain, ocean and desert environments.. Thus, ENSO events that disrupt traditional irrigation canals and maritime resources also offer opportunities in desert landscapes, prompting extensive biota growth. This raises the question of how people in the area took advantage of such fluctuations. In addition to differentially affecting ecological niches, ENSOs have varying impacts on neighboring coastal valleys. As a second adaptation to these events, this project tests for trade between groups of people inhabiting the coastal zone.Finally the region was a strategic forefront of maritime resources and likely participated in subsistence exchanges with people inhabiting higher, agriculturally-focused sites of the valley. ENSOs affect resource availability across the various altitudinally-determined ecological zones, so this project will also investigate coastal-highland resource exchanges as an  ENSO-resilience strategy. In conclusion, this project will combine climate modeling and archaeological data from site levels before, during, and after significant ENSO events to explore local resilience and determine how patterns of exchange fluctuated as fundamental human adaptations to ENSO events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, it will deepen our understanding of the advantages selenium confers to the chemistry of cellular life. An integral part of this project is its training of undergraduate and graduate students with physical, neurobiological, emotional, or learning disabilities. As active participants in this project, students with disabilities will gain invaluable research experience from which they are otherwise often excluded. Support and mentorship, both critical for their success and career progression, will be provided through two avenues. The first is through the team leader and members that work with them daily. The second is through an extensive network of students and professionals facing similar challenges that have been proven to be an invaluable, complementary source of support, opportunities, and encouragement.<br/><br/>Like all selenoproteins, selenoprotein s contains the genetically encoded amino acid selenocysteine. The use of the highly reactive selenium necessitates a tight, resource-intensive regulation, and all selenoproteins characterized so far exploit this costly amino acid for enzymatic function. Yet, despite their undisputed importance, the functions of many selenoproteins remain unidentified and await proper characterization. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap for the intrinsically disordered selenoprotein S, part of membrane-bound multi-protein complexes. Its function spans protein quality control, vesicle trafficking, lipid synthesis, and signaling. However, neither its direct protein partners nor the role of its reactive selenocysteine are currently known. To understand the enigmatic function of selenoprotein s, its interactome will be analyzed to pinpoint which proteins are key interactors. This will illuminate to which functions and pathways selenoprotein s directly connects. Then a selected subset of the identified interactors will be used for crosslinking, structural and proteomics studies to determine the interaction site(s) and its detailed structure. Together, this research will provide fundamental insight into the use of selenium in redox biology and the cellular roles of selenoproteins. <br/><br/>The award was funded by Molecular Biophysics (Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and the Chemistry of Life Processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Near-surface winds are a surface manifestation of large-scale atmospheric features such as stationary waves which are driven by changes in longitudinal (Meridional) and latitudinal (zonal) temperature gradients. In the future, near-surface winds are expected to change in response to changes in temperature and atmospheric circulation as driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations. However, projections of future near surface winds show a large uncertainty between the models. The researchers propose to evaluate this uncertainty via past climate data-model synthesis to assess the fidelity of model response to climate drivers outside the observational data. By investigating the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, the data synthesis and data-model comparison can potentially enhance the understanding of the factors driving changes in Northern hemisphere wind speeds and stationary waves. Further, it can potentially aid to detect model biases that may extend to future climate drivers. The potential Broader Impacts of this project include a novel application of wind proxy records to advance the understanding of past atmospheric circulation and improve future projections of wind variability. This project will generate a paleowind data synthesis in the Northern Hemisphere that will be available for the scientific community and will be publicly accessible. The gained knowledge through this research in terms of wind direction and gustiness can be potentially relevant to future wind energy resources.<br/><br/>The proposed research will produce a new synthesis of Northern Hemisphere, extratropical paleowind direction for the LGM from aeolian climate archives. Inferred paleowind direction from loess and dunes chronologically constrained to the LGM will be categorically compared to near-surface wind directions from the LGM simulations of the general circulation models (GCMs) participating the third and fourth Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Projects and the LGM periods of the Transient Climate Evolution and isotope-enabled Transient Climate Evolution (Trace-21k and iTrace) experiments. This comparison will allow the researchers to evaluate metrics for general atmospheric circulation in the top and bottom-ranking models based on the magnitude of data-model agreement. A further comparison with known temperature controls on stationary waves, e.g., the equator to pole temperature gradient and the ocean-land contrast, will be examined considering data-model agreement and stationary wave properties to assess potential model biases. Simulations from single forcing experiments, experiments using different ice sheet models, and the transient deglacial simulation will reveal the role of individual forcing factors and ice sheet orography in setting LGM near-surface wind direction and stationary wave properties. The project will support the careers of two female researchers and the scientific training of one graduate student. Additionally, the researchers will engage in outreach activities that will focus on developing and implementing a new education module for elementary students attending the local STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) Studio afterschool program in Champaign, IL. In this new module on weather and climate, with an emphasis on wind, the 20-member 5th grade student class will be given handheld Kestrel 1000 wind instruments to measure wind at different times of day and in different locations during a 6-week module period.

Online dictionary learning (ODL) is a mathematical formulation that emulates the human ability to extract patterns in real time. ODL has found fruitful applications in various domains such as text analysis, image reconstruction and denoising, medical imaging, and bioinformatics. However, existing theories and algorithms for ODL are facing significant challenges in coping with modern streaming data. This project will advance both the theoretical understanding and algorithmic capacities of existing ODL methods. More specifically, the project will address challenges in handling streaming data with multi-modal attributes, partial labels for further classification or inference tasks, and heterogeneous structure in the form of networks. This project will also involve interdisciplinary collaboration and provide research opportunities for students at all levels. <br/><br/>The project aims to advance the theory and algorithms of ODL in the following aspects: 1) Obtain the worst-case rate of convergence and iteration complexity of generalized ODL algorithms to stationary points for a stream of structured signals under Markovian dependence; 2) Devise supervised ODL algorithms for learning class-discriminating dictionaries from labeled streaming data with provable convergence guarantees and rate of convergence; 3) Use the theory and algorithm for supervised ODL with tensor-valued signals to develop methods of supervised and temporal network dictionary learning, where the former will learn discriminative basis subgraphs from network data for network classification and denoising applications and the latter will learn basis subgraphs and their time-evolution for reconstructing given temporal or multilayer networks. A key element is the development of stochastic majorization-minimization type algorithms that can handle complex surrogate functions depending on data type using block-minimization and regularization techniques. This project will also provide students with research experiences in optimization, machine learning, and network science. Specific topics for undergraduate research experience will include generating a repository of optimal network dictionaries for various real-world networks, network-level regression and inference experiments with biological networks, and temporal brain network analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ho and Anthony K. Rappé at Colorado State University to determine how halogens can replace magnesium in the design of catalytic proteins (enzymes) that break and make the bonds in DNA. Magnesium is the metal typically used by enzymes to help cut or join DNA in cells. Dr. Ho?s group has shown that the catalytic magnesium in an enzyme found in mice can be replaced by an unnatural chlorinated or iodinated amino acid. This project will determine how an interaction called halogen-bonding allows elements on opposite ends of the periodic table to catalyze the same DNA-modifying reactions. This science probes the idea of using halogen-bonding as a design tool to engineer synthetic enzymes for biotechnology applications. This project will provide training in structural and computational chemistry to graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups. Finally, an outreach project will help middle school and high school students learn how scientists use ?X-ray vision? see the atoms in three dimensions in DNA and proteins.<br/><br/>The making and breaking of the bonds along the DNA backbone are critical reactions in a broad range of genomic processes. Endonucleases and ligases typically use magnesium ion or similar metal cations as catalysts to specifically cut and rejoin DNA fragments. The Ho and Rappé groups have shown that the essential catalytic divalent magnesium ion in mouse endonuclease G (mEndoG) can be functionally replaced by a chlorinated or iodinated tyrosine. The resulting halogenated construct recapitulates the activity of the wild type mEndoG to specifically cleave four-stranded DNA Holliday junctions that contain a 5-hydroxymethylcytosine base. This cleavage reaction is catalyzed by a hydrogen bond (H-bond) enhanced halogen bond (X-bond), or HBeXB, for short. In addition, the halogenated enzyme was found to catalyze a unique ATP-independent DNA joining reaction that is also seen in the wild type mEndoG. This research project will characterize the structural and mechanistic properties that allow this metal-free, X-bond catalyzed enzyme (or cX-Zyme) to act as a site-specific endonuclease and an ATP-independent ligase. From a broad scientific perspective, this work raises the interesting possibility that one may be able to exploit X-bonding quite generally as a novel method to promote specific catalytic chemistry in enzyme active sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multicyclic peptides are short polymers of amino acids in which the backbones and side chains crosslink to form complex closed circular structures. Naturally occurring forms of multicyclic peptides, such as vancomycin, have been rich sources of antibacterial drugs. However, it has been difficult to develop synthetic multicyclic peptides that that have desired biological activities. The Gao group will integrate molecular biology and synthetic chemistry to construct libraries of peptides with complex multicyclic structures. These synthetic multicyclic peptides will be screened for their abilities to inhibit bacterial proteins using phage display, a technology that allows identification of compounds that show specific desired biological activities. This interdisciplinary project will help train the next-generation of scientists by engaging students in research, including undergraduate students and high school interns. <br/><br/>Phage display, a popular technology for screening peptide libraries, has been largely limited to the display of linear or simple disulfide-cyclized peptides. These peptides fall short in terms of structural complexity in comparison to peptide natural products, which often display multicyclic structures. In this studies, the Gao group aims to develop novel chemical strategies to construct multicyclic peptide libraries on the surfaces of bacteriophages. These strategies include developing and examining various protein conjugation chemistries, to be used in combination to effect sequential multicyclizations of phage-displayed peptides. Specifically, the research will capitalize on a newly developed ultrafast cysteine conjugation chemistry that crosslinks specific amino acid residues with high efficiency and site selectivity. These novel multicyclic peptide libraries will be used to screen and select for inhibitors of specific bacterial protein-protein interactions. If successful, this project will provide a powerful and broadly applicable strategy for inhibiting protein-protein interactions such as those that facilitate immune response evasion by bacterial pathogens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The motion of these electrons is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics and is affected by the competition between the electron?s kinetic energy, and the inter-electron Coulomb repulsion. <br/><br/>In the last few years, it has become possible to tune these different competing effects experimentally in several materials.  Most striking amongst these are two-dimensional moire structures formed by bringing together two single-atom thick layers of materials whose lattices are slightly different.   Fascinating phenomena have already been found in moire materials, and there is great promise for other profound future discoveries. This proposal will develop theoretical tools to study some of these phenomena and materials. The theory will be developed in the context of the many ongoing experiments on novel electronic insulators in moire, and other, materials. The goal is to provide a theoretical foundation and the tools needed to understand and predict the properties of these insulators.  <br/><br/>Fundamental research on electronic materials provides the foundational corpus upon which future electronic technological progress can build.  Its focus on the quantum mechanics of systems with many degrees of freedom will potentially teach us many useful lessons as we seek to gain control over such systems and develop quantum technologies. <br/><br/>The education component involves education at all levels, including undergraduate students at the frontiers of condensed matter theory.

Specific areas of interest are the description of strongly correlated quantum particles that move in a topological band. This problem is central to certain moire graphene structures, and to quantum hall systems restricted to a single Landau level. <br/><br/>The emphasis will be on general development of new theoretical concepts and field theoretic methods. When possible, these will be placed in the context of either experiments on specific materials or numerical work on specific microscopic models. <br/><br/>Research will (1) address basic questions on strong correlation in a partially filled topological band inspired by ongoing experiments on quantum anomalous Hall states in moire graphene, and (2) continue the PI's development of a lowest Landau level theory to solve a wider range of problems, including fermionic quantum Hall states. A broad range of analytical and numerical methods will be employed. The overarching goal is to develop a theoretical framework to describe strongly interacting electrons in a partially filled topological band that can address both universal and non-universal aspects of the physics.   <br/> <br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in modern condensed matter physics during this research. The PI will continue to design lectures to expose graduate students to experimental methods and the phenomenology of modern correlated materials.

These models predict that aerosol particles are highly acidic, but results differ depending on the model used.  This project aims to develop a novel direct measure of aerosol acidity using carbon quantum dots.  Using this approach will make it possible to explore the molecular origins of the high acidity of aerosol particles for both marine and continental environments. Further development of the probes will enable applications in atmospheric chemistry studies or in other fields where highly acidic samples are of interest. This project has potential for technology transfer, provides training for undergraduate and graduate students, and supports dissemination to the public through outreach events.<br/><br/>To study the acidity of aerosol particles, this project will use ratiometric fluorescence imaging of carbon quantum dots.

Ammonium sulfate will be used for model continental aerosol and sodium chloride will be used for model marine aerosol.  The organic compounds are chosen to be relevant for the specific type of aerosol as well as to have a range of pKa values, a range of complexities in composition from single organic compounds to mixtures, and a range of surface activities.

The project will develop instructional design supports for high school students that build on their novice intuitions for visualizing and interacting with complex datasets. The project will also develop design principles to guide technology developers, curricular developers, and researchers in creating environments more conducive to promoting data literacy for all learners, including those who are not confident math learners and those interested in further work in STEM.

First, the project envisions that providing students with resources to represent and visualize multidimensional data in ways that build on novice intuitions will allow them more agency in transforming data structures to answer their own questions. Second, the project posits that working collaboratively to build a multidimensional dataset can help students develop rich associations, which contribute to robust and flexible mental models of data structure that students can then apply to datasets more broadly. Research methods include think-aloud interviews and instructional sessions with small groups of students to explore their intuitive notions about data structure and how these intuitive notions can be leveraged to offer support for visualizing and transforming data. Project research will result in a) theoretical insights into how novices intuitively represent and interact with multidimensional data; b) design principles for constructing user interfaces and educational experiences that can support student understanding and use of multidimensional datasets; and c) tested examples of software user interfaces and instructional activities that exemplify the design principles.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

For example, vectors and fields are challenging in their own right, and even more so when presented using static two-dimensional imagery. Conversely, in virtual reality where students are able to be present in a tactile environment and use familiar gestures to interact with objects, the potential for deeper learning is enhanced. The scope of this project involves developing virtual reality-based physics learning spaces in which students can explore models from multiple angles, manipulate the components, and interact with an instructor who is also engaged within the environment. A critical component of the design is inclusive access, as the platform does not require expensive or complicated equipment. All students will be able to participate from anywhere with nothing more than a smartphone and a desire to learn.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop spatial computing environments that are specialized for undergraduate physics education. By leveraging expertise in educational research and state-of-the-art technologies, the team will prototype, iteratively develop, and optimize collaborative educational spaces where students can interact with three-dimensional renderings of physics phenomena and engage with each other and instructors in real time. The scope of this project involves (1) constructing three fundamental learning spaces: electric fields, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic waves, and (2) developing research-based theory regarding how virtual reality experiences can improve students? learning gains. The spaces will include dynamic graphical elements relevant to the physics phenomenon, interaction tools to modify those phenomena, a live instructor who can assume a student?s perspective to see exactly what the student is viewing, and learning assessment measures. The students? actions in these virtual environments and their learning gains will be studied in order to optimize the design and implementation of this novel approach. Access to the environment will be inclusive because it is platform-agnostic: while the instructor may use sophisticated tools, students can join with a tablet or smartphone.

However, how localized defects can cause complete structural and functional collapse of the axon is not known. To answer this question, this project will investigate experimentally and numerically the main biophysical mechanisms that regulate structural and functional stability of the unmyelinated neuronal axon and determine the cascade of events causing mechanically induced axonal collapse. The project will have a broader impact by providing an improved understanding of innate mechanisms that regulate axonal injury and it could lead to development of novel diffuse axonal injury diagnosis protocols. In addition, the project will benefit undergraduate and graduate students at UCONN by introducing them to virtual reality as an interactive applied mechanics tool. The outreach activities will promote engineering and science to high school teachers and students and will advance participation of high school underrepresented minority students into science and technology. <br/><br/>The mechanical stability of the axon is supported by its periodic axon plasma membrane skeleton (PAMS), which was recently discovered to comprise a series of azimuthal ring-like F-actins connected longitudinally by ?II/?II or ?II/?IV spectrin tetramers held under entropic tension forming an orthotropic material. Internally, an axon comprises longitudinally oriented interconnected microtubules and neurofilaments, which are attached to organelles and to plasma membrane proteins such as Ankyrin G. If the axon only counts on relative rigid cytoskeletal filaments, such as microtubules, for mechanical stability, then under bending stress, microtubules will likely break and undergo instability via depolymerization. This can cause the axon membrane to collapse if there is not additional support by the PAMS. Furthermore, disruption of PAMS could potentially lead to microtubules depolymerization and axon degeneration. It is then likely that the hypothesis that dynamic equilibrium between PAMS and microtubules play a very important role in mechanical flexibility and durability of the axons is justified. Finally, it is currently unknown how distribution and mobility of ion channels in the axon plasma membrane is affected during axonal deformation and injury. The project will determine the structural and functional behavior of an axon under dynamic extension, bending, and twisting, and the cascade of events during a mechanically induced axonal collapse and effect on action potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lasers have transformed the science and technological landscape since the first was built in 1960. Lasers enable fundamental science from the atomic scale to astronomical and have numerous applications, such as information storage and retrieval, medical imaging and surgery, environmental monitoring, and aviation, to name a few. For such a broad array of uses, it is important to span a broad electromagnetic spectrum of frequencies (colors), ranging from x-rays and the ultraviolet, through the visible and the infrared and beyond. However, lasers are designed to emit light only within a few narrow windows of frequencies. So, how can such a broad tunable electromagnetic spectrum be obtained? The answer lies in the field of nonlinear optics, where specialized materials combine and split photons of various colors to generate new photons with different colors, a process called nonlinear frequency conversion or harmonic generation. We are now at the threshold of a new era of quantum communications that employs quantum entanglement of two photons that Einstein called ?spooky action at a distance.? Such secure internet lines are considered critical for national security, from protecting power grids, distribution networks for water and food, and the financial system. Entangled photons are generated by splitting a photon into two using nonlinear optical crystals. This needs nonlinear optical crystals superior to those presently in use. In particular, there is a lack of materials that function in the infrared and the ultraviolet. The project will address the grand materials challenge of finding new nonlinear optical crystals with superior properties. The PI will also communicate the excitement and fundamentals of these amazing optical and quantum phenomena and work to help develop a diverse, able workforce to meet these technology challenges.<br/><br/>Technical Description. The central goal of this project is to synthesize and characterize nonlinear optical single crystals with compositions that optimize the highest second order nonlinear optical coefficients with the largest transparency towards efficient frequency conversion. The project has two primary thrusts. First, under the theme of Beyond Powders towards Single Crystals, investigators will perform theory-guided identification, synthesis, and comprehensive linear and nonlinear optical tensors determination of the most promising nonlinear optical single crystals suggested by theory and experimental literature on powders.  The second thrust is on Nonlinear Modeling and Light Frequency Conversion. In characterizing such higher ranked tensor properties in nonlinear optics, accurate modeling of the experimental data is critical; analytical modeling tools for this are currently absent. The project is developing an open-source code for predicting and accurately modeling the experimental nonlinear optical response from these crystals. Nonlinear frequency conversion devices are being explored for the most promising crystal compositions. The project is working towards demonstrating at least a dozen new single crystals, as well developing as an open-source modeling package. The project funds the training of two graduate and one undergraduate student every year towards a diverse and inclusive workforce in the area of optical materials and technologies. The students have an opportunity to learn and develop crystal growth as well as a full suite of nonlinear optical characterization and modeling tools.

The size and shape of the image of this map has implications for the underlying geometry of the hyperbolic manifold, and the project aims to bound the size of the image in terms of the topology of the underlying manifold's boundary, without any dependence on the topology of the underlying manifold. Using this, the project aims to construct uniform models of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The techniques involved in the approach are of wider interest, and the project aims to use these techniques to establish new theorems on the geometric inflexibility of hyperbolic manifolds.

Stem cells have been an area of focused study in basic sciences due to their therapeutic potential in treating human disease. However, precise control over stem cell differentiation into useful therapeutic cells remains challenging, and better regulation of stem cell behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue formation could expedite biomedical applications of human stem cells. Natural and synthetic biomaterials can serve as a ?scaffold? that controls the cell?s environment, often by mimicking the native environment in which the cells grow. Plants have developed unique and diverse material properties over more than 700 million years of evolution, and plant properties are ideally suited to support stem cell growth. The scalable, sustainable nature of plant leaf production, along with enhanced oxygen diffusion, wide diversity of morphology and length scales, and their biocompatibility, all make a strong case for their development as a broadly useful biomaterial for human stem cell manufacturing. However, plant-derived materials provide no intrinsic mechanism for proper attachment and function of human cells. The synthetic polymer coatings developed through this work will control cell-biomaterial attachment and present signals to stem cells that control their fate. The plant-derived biomaterials developed through this work can be delivered to cell biologists and bioengineers, who can use them to probe key biological questions or manufacture specific cells of interest. This research program will serve to educate and inspire rural high school students and teachers by the development of an interdisciplinary learning module. The award will enhance, retain, and promote engagement and research experience for undergraduates at UW-Madison. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Biomaterials based on decellularized plant materials provide intricate interconnected vasculature for transport of biomolecules, as well as wide diversity in morphology and length scales for cell alignment and pattern registration. The research proposed here aims to develop a decellularized plant leaf-based biomaterial as a broadly useful and adaptable biomaterial for human cell culture. The research will test the hypothesis that plant-derived materials conformally coated with chemically-defined polymer films will support cell adhesion, viability and alignment, and also enhance stem cell differentiation toward functional tenocytes and myocytes. The work focuses on developing methodology to fully characterize plant-derived biomaterials and on developing coating chemistry to modify leaf surfaces to make them conducive for human cell culture. This understanding will allow systematic interrogation of the effect of surface topography and the customizable surface chemistry on the cellular alignment and differentiation. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are 1) the development of the decellularization process, and comprehensive characterization of chemical composition, cytotoxicity, morphology, enzymatic degradability, mass transport, and mechanical properties of the leaf material, 2) development of novel copolymer coating chemistry to minimize non-specific adsorption of biomolecules, enable the nanometer-scale co-localization of adhesion peptides, and quantitatively present a combination of muscle and tendon extra-cellular matrix derived peptides, and 3) correlating the leaf microtopography and surface chemistry with cell alignment during myogenic and tenogenic differentiation using second harmonic generation microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nature provides an abundance of biopolymers such as cellulose and starch which are typically benign and can degrade to water and carbon dioxide in the environment. They can be chemically modified to produce, for example, broadly useful cellulose derivatives that are widely employed by society, including in medicines. Getting a medicine into the body by swallowing a tablet is becoming increasingly difficult because few modern drugs easily dissolve in water. It is important that a drug can be dissolved from a tablet in the right region of the digestive system so that it can be absorbed and exert its therapeutic effects on the body. Biopolymers can be used to help improve drug solubility and release. However, because new generations of drugs are increasingly difficult to absorb, it is important to understand more about how polymers dissolve and release their cargo, and how to chemically modify these polymers to make them even more effective at delivering drugs and other poorly soluble additives. This research investigates how polymers interact with water, and how this in turn impacts the rate of polymer dissolution. Polymers will be mixed with water-hating additives (many drugs can be described as water-hating), revealing how this changes dissolution. Finally, new biopolymer derivatives will be designed that maintain a good interaction with water, even in the presence of water-hating additives. The goal is to develop polymers that are more effective than existing polymers at releasing poorly water-soluble drugs (and other additives). Broad impacts of this work include training graduate and undergraduate students including under-represented minorities and women, including developing a professional skills program for graduate students.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Polymer dissolution is both fundamentally and practically important. It differs significantly from small molecule dissolution and is often problematic. Key issues include slow or poorly controlled dissolution, and undesired gelation. Systems that also contain small molecule additives are common, for example amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for enhancement of aqueous solubility of hydrophobic additives. In these systems, mismatch of additive and polymer dissolution rates can lead to system failure (e.g. additive precipitation). Fundamental understanding of how additives impact polymer dissolution is lacking. Herein, we propose to elucidate the impact of additives on the rate limiting steps of biopolymer dissolution, in particular for polysaccharide (PS) derivatives, whose benign nature and potential for modification make them well suited for polymer/additive systems of technical importance. A set of novel PS derivatives will be designed and synthesized to test key hypotheses about the importance of hydration extent, as well as the impacts of specific functional groups upon dissolution rate. Selective PS oxidation and halogenation will permit substitution with omega-amino and omega-mercaptocarboxylic acids. PS dissolution rates will be measured in the presence and absence of model additives; tests of impact of ionization, counterion size/nature, and steric hindrance will reveal whether hydration rate/extent is the key rate limiting step. By elucidating polymer structural features necessary for release, the goal is to develop new oral delivery systems for poorly water-soluble compounds. Students will collaborate to elucidate rate-limiting steps in polymer dissolution, synthesize and characterize polymers, test dissolution rates with and without carefully selected additives, and apply the generated fundamental understanding to refine theory and enhance polymer design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Imaging in cells and mammals using chemiluminescence offers significant advantages including low-cost, high sensitivity, low phototoxicity, and the ability to image in deeper tissue. This emerging technique for molecular imaging is limited, however, by a lack of methods for precise quantitative imaging of analytes and optimal microscopy instrumentation.

Near-surface winds are a surface manifestation of large-scale atmospheric features such as stationary waves which are driven by changes in longitudinal (Meridional) and latitudinal (zonal) temperature gradients. In the future, near-surface winds are expected to change in response to changes in temperature and atmospheric circulation as driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations. However, projections of future near surface winds show a large uncertainty between the models. The researchers propose to evaluate this uncertainty via past climate data-model synthesis to assess the fidelity of model response to climate drivers outside the observational data. By investigating the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, the data synthesis and data-model comparison can potentially enhance the understanding of the factors driving changes in Northern hemisphere wind speeds and stationary waves. Further, it can potentially aid to detect model biases that may extend to future climate drivers. The potential Broader Impacts of this project include a novel application of wind proxy records to advance the understanding of past atmospheric circulation and improve future projections of wind variability. This project will generate a paleowind data synthesis in the Northern Hemisphere that will be available for the scientific community and will be publicly accessible. The gained knowledge through this research in terms of wind direction and gustiness can be potentially relevant to future wind energy resources.<br/><br/>The proposed research will produce a new synthesis of Northern Hemisphere, extratropical paleowind direction for the LGM from aeolian climate archives. Inferred paleowind direction from loess and dunes chronologically constrained to the LGM will be categorically compared to near-surface wind directions from the LGM simulations of the general circulation models (GCMs) participating the third and fourth Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Projects and the LGM periods of the Transient Climate Evolution and isotope-enabled Transient Climate Evolution (Trace-21k and iTrace) experiments. This comparison will allow the researchers to evaluate metrics for general atmospheric circulation in the top and bottom-ranking models based on the magnitude of data-model agreement. A further comparison with known temperature controls on stationary waves, e.g., the equator to pole temperature gradient and the ocean-land contrast, will be examined considering data-model agreement and stationary wave properties to assess potential model biases. Simulations from single forcing experiments, experiments using different ice sheet models, and the transient deglacial simulation will reveal the role of individual forcing factors and ice sheet orography in setting LGM near-surface wind direction and stationary wave properties. The project will support the careers of two female researchers and the scientific training of one graduate student.

The results of this work will greatly advance progress in science and improvements in national health. Mechanobiology is a science that seeks to explain how cells actively adapt to mechanical forces.  Understanding the mechanobiology of cells can lead to new therapies to treat damage due to aging and disease. There are many ways that cells react to force, which often involves the cell nucleus that contains the DNA defining our genetic code. However, we do not yet know how mechanical force stimulates the cell to alter its structure and position of DNA.  This award supports fundamental research to measure gene expression in the cell nucleus and how it changes with applied forces.  This will reveal mechanisms that cells use to alter their biological function triggered by force. Understanding this complex biological process may lead to new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in medical science. This research project is multidisciplinary, and impacts the sciences of biomedical engineering, imaging, biomechanics, cell biology, and materials science.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. A key challenge for ecology in the 21st century is predicting how perturbations, such as species loss, declines in abundance, and changing environmental conditions, propagate across levels of organization and over time in biological systems. Ecological systems can be extremely difficult to predict in specific detail, but often conform to predictable patterns at larger, aggregated scales. In many instances, these aggregate patterns converge with patterns that emerge at random - not because ecological and evolutionary processes do not contribute to these patterns, but because many interacting processes at multiple levels of organization smooth or cancel each other out. However, strong perturbations can temporarily drive aggregate patterns away from the forms they assume at random. The fellow will construct a unified theoretical, empirical, and computational framework for using disruptions to aggregate patterns to detect and diagnose strong disturbances to ecological and evolutionary dynamics. As part of this work, they will develop computational and educational materials to facilitate wider uptake of complex systems approaches in ecology, and lead workshops in active allyship in the university setting and computational skills for early-stage scientists. <br/>The fellow will use agent-based simulations of random, process-driven, and experimentally perturbed eco-evolutionary dynamics to characterize the expected impacts of different types and magnitudes of disturbances on aggregated patterns in ecological systems. They will integrate these findings with the predictions from established theories derived from community ecology, population genetics, and statistical mechanics. They will test the causal link between perturbations and disruptions to aggregate patterns in experimentally manipulated empirical systems using case studies and a meta-analysis of disturbance experiments. They will develop a lab module on emergent phenomena for a theoretical ecology course, and produce software packages, workshop curricula, and interactive online tutorials to support applications of this conceptual framework in new contexts. They will receive training in simulation modeling, population genetics, software and curriculum development, and mentoring. The products of this work will be publicly archived and made openly available for re-use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faye McNeill at Columbia University and Yi Rao at Utah State University. The project addresses how surfaces of atmospheric particles uniquely affect the chemical reactions taking place there. A better understanding of atmospheric particle chemistry is needed for quantifying the impacts of human activities on air quality and climate. Until recently, this understanding was limited by a lack of analytical techniques capable of probing surface-specific particle chemistry. The team has developed unique laboratory methods for studying the chemistry of particles suspended in gas in a laboratory setting. These are surface-specific sum frequency generation (SFG) and highly-sensitive HyperRaman Scattering (HRS). These techniques will be applied together with complementary gas-particle chemical kinetics studies to characterize processes that are unique to aerosol surfaces. In addition to the training of graduate and undergraduate students at both institutions, the team will also engage in outreach activities designed to reach students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and the general public.<br/><br/>Surface-specific particle chemistry will be investigated in three scenarios: (1) the acid-catalyzed oligomerization of acetaldehyde at the gas-aerosol interface, (2) the formation of light-absorbing products from the reactions of methoxyphenols in aqueous aerosols, and their subsequent liquid-liquid phase separation, and (3) small particles which are expected to have a sharp pressure gradient between the surface and bulk, with implications for aqueous reaction rates (Laplace pressure). The team will also conduct numerical simulations in order to evaluate the potential environmental impact of these processes and develop representations for this new chemistry in large-scale atmospheric models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, ports are often designated centers for post-earthquake staging and relief efforts. However, seismic evaluation studies of port structures often encounter a knowledge gap related to soil-foundation-structure interaction in soils that are susceptible to liquefaction ? a phenomenon that causes severe softening of soils in earthquakes. The knowledge gap becomes even wider for foundations that are supported in silty soils (commonly encountered at port facilities) as there is no consensus in the geotechnical community on how to predict the behavior of silty soils in earthquakes. This research will address these knowledge gaps by performing a series of advanced physical experiments and numerical simulations. The findings of this research will result in safer, more resilient maritime transportation systems. Close collaborations with industry partners will ensure that the knowledge produced in this study will benefit the broader engineering community. Characterizing the behavior of silty soils in earthquakes will have a significant effect in assessing, and reducing, the risks associated with an imminent Magnitude 9 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. with substantial economical and societal impacts. The research will also be complemented by a partnership with the LSAMP program at Portland State University to help enhance STEM education with emphasis on diversity. <br/><br/>This research has two specific objectives: (1) to investigate a collapse mechanism due to incremental yielding in in-ground pile plastic hinges when subjected to many cycles of loading in long-duration earthquakes, and (2) to quantify the interaction of inertial and kinematic loads on piles with respect to various ground motion characteristics, pile properties, soil profiles, and soil properties. These objectives will be achieved by performing a series of large-scale geotechnical centrifuge tests at the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) facility at UC Davis combined with numerical parametric simulations. The results of this research will provide an in-depth understanding of the interaction of inertial and kinematic loads on piles in liquefiable soils which are needed for seismic evaluation studies of new and existing ports as well as other pile-supported structures including highway bridges, buildings and nearshore structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The examples of such systems are numerous: e.g., any received radio signal is subject to noise, the temperature in some parts of the ocean may not be known exactly at all times but is correlated with the known temperatures in other locations, a price of a house may not be known precisely before it is sold but it is correlated with the transaction prices of similar properties, etc. In this context, the PI will focus on two questions: how to efficiently estimate the unknown parameters of such systems given historical data, and how to choose these parameters in order to maximize a given objective. The concrete applications that motivate this work arise from Finance and Economics: namely, from the problem of estimating the parameters of unobserved price process of a financial asset (e.g., a stock price between transactions) and from the question of optimal contract design (e.g., what is the optimal structure of fees that brokers should charge to their clients, if the latter have proprietary knowledge about the market). In addition, the results of this work will contribute to the general methodology for estimation and optimization of partially observed dynamical systems and, hence, be applicable to many other problems arising in social and natural sciences. Participation in the project will provide good training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project consists of two lines of research on the stochastic dynamical systems with partial observations. The first is concerned with the problem of statistical inference of unknown parameters in partially observed diffusion models. In particular, the PI will investigate the large-sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for partially observed diffusion models, and will develop approximation methods in the case of degenerate diffusions where the likelihood function cannot be computed directly. This research is motivated by the problem of estimating the unknown parameters in latent price models of market microstructure. The second line of research is concerned with the design of optimal contracts in the presence of information asymmetry between the principal and the agent. The information asymmetry that the PI will consider is different from the classical moral hazard type and stems from the difference in the exogenously given filtrations to which the actions of the principal and of the agent are adapted. Such optimal contract models lead to challenging stochastic control problems with informational constraints. The second line of research is motivated, in particular, by the problem of designing optimal brokerage fees in financial markets. The results of the proposed research will make significant contributions to both theory and applications. The first line of research (concerned with MLEs) is expected to advance the mathematical foundations of Statistics and to develop new computational methods for parameter estimation in partially observed systems. These results will be applied to specific problems in market microstructure (such as the reconstruction of the true unobserved price of an asset and the estimation of price impact) as well as to inference problems in other areas (e.g., Computational Neuroscience). The results of the second line of research (concerned with optimal contracts) will contribute to the theories of stochastic control and optimal contract design. These theoretical results, in particular, can be used to develop better understanding of the effects of intermediaries (brokers) on the financial markets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award supports fundamental research to extend traditional design of single-function materials and structures by formulating a new holistic framework for design of intricate multifunctional structures and materials through new multiphysics algorithms that are able to optimize material constituents and architectures simultaneously. Such materials are critical to many technologically advanced biomedical, clean energy, aerospace, and transportable electronics applications. This project offers design-themed educational and outreach activities to enhance public knowledge and attract talented students to STEM careers in the design area. The educational plan improves design-related educational activities by integrating several modular lectures based on the ?philosophy of design? into design courses offered in engineering departments. The project also targets academically at-risk and underrepresented minority (URM) students to reduce school dropout via an out-of-school-time (OST) STEM education program. <br/><br/>Overcoming current design limitations for multifunctional materials and structures is challenging because i) the mathematical models that are used to predict the performance of such designs are complex, ii) numerical solutions for such models are computationally expensive, and iii) it requires interdisciplinary/multiphysics design methods capable of tailoring materials at multiple scales to balance opposing design drivers. To address these challenges, this CAREER project will create a 3-M (Multiphysics, Multiscale, Multifunctional) Design framework that establishes new algorithms capable of optimizing paradoxical functions in a material system.  The cores of this new framework are efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) and machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models integrated into multiphysics/multiscale optimization methods to enable the efficient design of such materials with desired multifunctional properties. The framework created in this project will allow tailoring multifunctional materials by balancing among conflicting design requirements that could not otherwise be achieved using single-function design strategies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework, the 3-M Design framework will be used to design structural battery (SBCs) and microvascular (MVCs) composites with superior properties. SBCs show significant potential in producing mass-less batteries used in the automotive, aviation, and robotics industries. Actively cooled MVCs make it possible to use fiber-reinforced polymer composites in high-temperature automobile, aerospace, and microelectronic applications. The 3-M Design framework is material independent and can be used for the design of different multifunctional materials that may have opposing design requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the abundance of such data is advantageous, it brings forth several computational challenges. One challenge is the fact that data might contain numerous missing entries. This is the case for instance when using physical measurement devices with a limited range or in collecting user preferences for a product where we lack complete information. One line of methods that has proved to be useful for this problem is matrix completion algorithms which predict missing entries with minimalistic assumptions on the data. However, in problems such as structure prediction and recommendation system with side information, the measurements are not entry-wise. Specifically, the observations are an aggregate of some entries of the underlying data, i.e., rather than directly observing the entries of the data, the user has access to certain combinations of these entries. This project aims to study this problem which is well known as the matrix sensing problem. The majority of previous works consider the case where measurements of the data are missing at random or assume that the measurement protocol itself is random. Motivated by practical applications, this project considers a realistic setup where the measurements are structured and deterministic. A key goal of this project is to advance the state of art theory and computation of matrix sensing by studying new optimization algorithms. Another aim of the project is to apply the constructed framework to robust structure prediction and machine learning. <br/><br/>This project seeks to study scalable non-convex methods for a class of generalized matrix recovery problems. In particular, PIs are interested in low-rank matrix sensing problems with deterministically structured measurements under various settings. The main approach is based on formulating the optimization problem with respect to a deterministic measurement basis and its associated dual basis. This yields a well-posed problem under some mild conditions. The project is centered on three objectives. In the first part, the project studies the local convergence of a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm that directly optimizes over the manifold of low-rank matrices. The recovery guarantee then will depend mainly on the spectral properties of the basis and the dual basis, the sampling scheme, and the initialization. Tight estimation of the spectral properties and effective initialization method will be investigated by bridging connections to spectral graph theory. The second objective is to design an algorithm tailored for the Euclidean distance geometry (EDG) problem which aims to estimate the configuration of points given partial information about pairwise distances. EDG is a representative problem that utilizes deterministically structured measurements. By leveraging the special structure of EDG, the project aims to design optimally efficient algorithms and establish theoretical analysis for the exact recovery of the point configuration. The third objective considers the setting where the measurements might be sparsely corrupted. The project aims to develop fast and robust algorithms tailored to this case and carry out the necessary analysis for recovery guarantees. To realize these objectives, the project leverages tools from high-dimensional probability, Riemannian optimization, numerical analysis, and spectral graph theory. The project will provide opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students with interests in distance geometry, optimization theory, and computational science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Specifically, the fellow will investigate the genetics, physiology, and variation of a biological phenomenon called diapause. Diapause is a period of suspended or arrested development during an insect?s life cycle. The fellow will use the eastern sprice budworm to study diapause. The spruce budworm is a moth species living in the boreal forest across northern America, covering a range from New England to Alaska, and mostly uses diapause to survive harsh winters. The fellow will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in diapausing moths. This work is important because the spruce budworm is one of the most destructive pest species in North America, and its 35-year cyclical outbreaks have devastating effects on the lumber industry as well as the boreal ecosystem and carbon dynamics. The proposed activity will help us understand how diapause changes across it?s range, which will be crucial for predictive models of budworm range expansion and benefit a robust pest management plan. This in turn will aid the communities depending on the boreal forests. Furthermore, the fellow will engage in several outreach activities to engage high school and college level students with insect research.<br/><br/>Diapause is a fundamental feature in the life cycle of many insects, as it allows insects to survive temporary harsh environmental conditions. Precise timing and regulation of the diapause phenotype can have landscape level consequences, both good (i.e. insects can be important food sources), and bad (i.e. harmful pest species). The fellow will (1) characterize the physiological, transcriptomic and chromatin landscape changes that differentiate diapausing and non-diapausing spruce budworm, (2) determine the genetic basis of this change in the diapause phenotype, and (3), investigate how natural selection acts on the diapause specific regulatory landscape across the range. This study integrates across multiple science disciplines including physiology, functional genomics, genetic mapping and population genetics to study the diapause phenotype. Results from this study will allow us to predict how the diapause phenotype is regulated at different levels, and how natural selection acts on these regulatory mechanisms. The fellow will receive training in integrating physiological and genetic research in an ecological relevant species. Furthermore, the fellow will organize a functional genomics workshop to make advanced molecular techniques available to non-model researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms can cause severe problems, including medical infections, fouling, and clogging in industrial applications. In contrast, biofilms play beneficial roles in wastewater treatment and microbial fuel cells. Scientists have been able to characterize the chemical components of biofilms but don?t know yet how an active, self-renewable, and self-healing material emerges from these components and their interactions. How can scientists use their vast knowledge of man-made polymers to understand these natural polymers? Are there new physical mechanisms to be discovered in the way bacteria build their biofilm communities? To answer these questions, this project aims to reveal the secrets of how biofilms derive mechanical properties from their individual components by integrating state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, and computer simulations. Through these fundamental studies, scientists can design better strategies that either eliminate harmful biofilms or use beneficial biofilms to create useful structures. By integrating multiple disciplines, this project will train a diverse group of students in the areas of biology, physics, materials science, and engineering, and prepare them for the next-generation workforce. The educational objectives of the project will be realized through curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, and K-12 outreach programs, with special efforts to involve underrepresented students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacteria embedded in a matrix made of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The overarching goal of this project is to integrate state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, mutagenesis, computer simulations, and soft matter theory to address how, at different time and length scales, bacterial cells build communities with emerging mechanical properties. Specifically, the three research objectives are to (i) establish EPS as associative polymers crosslinked by matrix proteins, (ii) reveal the contribution of bacterial cells to biofilm mechanics, and (iii) measure the development of biofilm mechanics and heterogeneity at the single-cell level. These objectives are accomplished via experiments involving rheological testing, high-resolution imaging, protein biochemistry, bacterial genetics, and multiscale modeling. The broader impacts of this work are to help produce a diverse STEM-capable workforce by incorporating central concepts addressed in this project into education and outreach activities that expose and engage students in biology, materials science, physics, and engineering. The education and outreach activities center on the following three objectives: (i) expanding the Pathways to Science program for local high school students, (ii) incorporating research findings into the curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate courses, and (iii) providing research experiences to underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project the spaces of interest are one-, two- and three-dimensional. These are called curves, surfaces, and three-manifolds. A common thread in this research program is leveraging combinatorial constructions of curves on surfaces to answer broader geometric and algebraic questions. At the heart of the project is the interplay between several fields of mathematics, namely- topology, combinatorics, and algebra, that arises in the study of surfaces through their mapping class groups. The project includes directions that are suitable for both graduate and undergraduate research. The PI will continue conference organization as well as her engagement with community-wide initiatives to address issues of equity and justice in mathematics and community-building initiatives for members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The mapping class group of a surface captures its topological symmetries. This group appears across mathematics from algebraic geometry (e.g., the moduli space of a Riemann surface) to low-dimensional topology (e.g., Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds) to dynamics (e.g., the topological entropy of braids). Thus, the study of surfaces can provide insights into a wide range of mathematical problems while making use of the structure and rigidity found in dimensions one and two. The PI and her collaborators will investigate the geometry and topology of surfaces, using a three-pronged approach: 1) the algebra and dynamics of the mapping class group of surfaces of both finite and infinite type; 2) the length spectra of non-positively curved metrics on surfaces; and, 3) the coarse-geometry of various graphs naturally associated to surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. coastal communities are susceptible to tropical cyclone (TC) damages, with urban infrastructure that is ill-equipped for TC-induced flooding. Recent active Atlantic hurricane seasons (i.e., 2020) have cast justified attention on the role of climate change in altering TCs in the North Atlantic. However, a robust analysis of the influence of longer-time scale climate variability on the frequency and trajectories of TC is hindered by the short observation datasets (~ 50 years available from satellite records). Past records of hurricanes (proxy records) can extend the record of TC statistics to thousands of years beyond observational data. But these records tend to capture only close-moving and intense storms which make it difficult to ascertain whether past records of hurricanes are related to climate variability or randomness (stochasticity). Therefore, this project proposes to rigorously assess uncertainties associated with past hurricane records (paleohurricanes) by analyzing existing proxies of TCs from the North Atlantic and comparing them to new TC model simulations of the past millennium. These data-model comparisons will then be used to both investigate the sensitivity of Atlantic TCs to changing climate drivers and feedbacks in a model world, and to test the ability of individual and networks of paleohurricane records in capturing TC climate in the real world.

Among the various flood-related risks, flood-borne debris can be destructive to coastal infrastructure (e.g., buildings, houses, and bridges). Such debris (e.g. trees, cars, and ships) are carried by floods and waves, often in combination with extreme wind gusts. Currently, there is a significant gap in understanding and modeling the key physical processes associated with flood-borne debris. This project will provide a science-based approach to understand and predict the flood-borne debris damages to structures under extreme flood flow and wind conditions. The research will also be complemented by an educational component that includes workshops, curriculum development, and training demonstrations. The educational program will be designed to have positive and measurable impact on a broad spectrum of students (ranging from high school to graduate students), foster an increased participation among minority and underrepresented groups, and inform students of the novel research and diverse cultures of the three participating institutions, i.e., Columbia University, SUNY at Stony Brook, and CUNY City College.

A multidisciplinary approach employing computational fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, and laboratory experiments will be used to achieve this goal. Specific research tasks include: (1) innovative experiments deploying ?smart debris? to investigate wind and transport effects of flood-borne debris and their impact/damage to structures, (2) new computational methods and software for an integrated simulation of debris drifting, impingement, and damage to structures, and (3) novel physics-based fragility curves, at the system level, for structural failure risk assessment due to debris impacts.

Recent single-cell technologies profile a tissue with unprecedented resolution and scale, for example, expression levels of thousands of genes in thousands of individual cells. Extracting biological insights from this data relies on structural representations, such as how to describe similarities between cells and what global shape the data presents. While numerous methods have been developed to perform various analysis tasks, this initial step of representing the structure of data is understudied. This project will develop new topological and geometric methods, a formal language of describing shapes, to investigate and characterize the structure of single-cell data. The structural characterizations will be linked to cell functions to reveal structure-function relationships. These methods will be integrated into the large collection of existing analysis tools for single-cell data to improve the reliability and robustness of the biological conclusions and predictions. Application of these tools will help to identify cells carrying critical functions and the properties of these cells. The methods will be implemented as publicly available open-source software packages. The research will promote interdisciplinary collaborations between biologists and mathematicians with an interest in advancing the structure-function relationship in single-cell data. This project will also provide training for students and underrepresented groups at the interface of advanced mathematics and modern biological data analysis.<br/><br/>Numerous single-cell data analysis tools rely on structural representations with reduced dimensions, and the observations could be sensitive to the low-dimensional representation used. A systematic exploration of structural representations is thus needed to control the reliability and interpretability of downstream analysis results. Methods based on applied topology and geometry will be developed to extract low-dimensional structural characteristics from the high-dimensional single-cell omics data by scanning a wide range of scales and parameters. Methods will be developed to adapt to the application of single-cell omics data analysis, for example, local topological fingerprints and topology-guided optimal transport. An atlas of structural representations for a single-cell dataset with well-defined metrics quantifying the difference between structures will be assembled to provide a systematic way of representing the structures of single-cell omics data. A generally applicable pipeline of applying downstream analysis tools upon this structure atlas will be introduced and evaluated in various application cases. The systematic structural analysis method will be combined with machine learning to further address two important questions: establishment of structure-function relationships in single-cell datasets, such as identifying transition cells based on their local structures in the dataset, and integration of single-cell multi-omics datasets based on topological and geometric characterizations, especially for datasets without shared features. Efficient, stable, and accurate numerical methods and algorithms will be developed for these mathematical questions motivated by biological applications.

The fluorescence coming from a single QD is not constant, but rather exhibits periods of light emission followed by periods of darkness. In short, they blink. Blinking is a universal behavior of QDs and understanding its mechanism is critical to many applications.  However, determining the blinking mechanism is challenging because it must be studied in one QD at a time, and one must study many QDs to draw meaningful conclusions. To address this challenge, Professors Zhao, Chen, and Chen along with their students will apply modern statistical learning approaches to analyze fluorescence blinking in many perovskite QDs with varying compositions. The discoveries could have implications for how QDs are used in applications ranging from LED displays to biological imaging.

For instance, children might create tables or graphs to organize information about the relationship between two quantities.

The project will use data gathered in K-2 classrooms and via interviews with children to describe their use of the visual representations. <br/><br/>This exploratory project aims to develop learning trajectories as cognitive models of how children in grades K?2 understand visual representations for algebraic relationships.

It entails reasoning about the structure of arithmetic expressions and equations rather than their computational value. The project has three guiding research questions. First, what are trajectories of learning in how grades K?2 children understand visual representations such as tables, graphs, and diagrams of algebraic relationships? Second, what features of tasks or instruction facilitate movement in students? thinking within the trajectories? Third, what are similarities and differences in how children understand visual representations of algebraic relationships across the content dimensions of functional thinking and generalized arithmetic? The study will use a design-based research methodological framework to organize data collection via classroom teaching experiments, semi-clinical interviews, classroom observations, and children?s written work.

The mathematical modeling of these effects lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and statistical physics, and it involves the study of kinetic equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations that captures the behavior of large number of particles in terms of the particle density. This project concentrates on two specific kinetic equations: the first describes the time evolution of the particle distribution when particles interact through binary collisions that can occur at very large microscopical distances, the second arises in the statistical description of charged quantum particles. The intent is to validate the fidelity of these models to the physical systems by studying the qualitative properties of their solutions, to ensure that a temporary breakdown of the models does not occur. The project will provide training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/> <br/>The project aims at expanding the mathematical understanding of the dynamics of collisions in dilute gases and plasma by analyzing two kinetic partial differential equations. The first is the Landau equation, which describes the time evolution of the particle distribution when particles interact through binary collisions of grazing type. The second is the Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation, which arises in the statistical description of charged quantum particles. Both equations present challenges due to nonlinear terms, nonlocal features, and degenerate coefficients. The first part of the project deals with the qualitative properties of solutions, such as global well-posedness and finite time blow-up, characterization of the long-time behavior, and connection with macroscopic fluid equations. The second part concerns the validity of the Landau-Fermi-Dirac approximation as a correction to the Boltzmann equation in the grazing regime. The techniques employed include a novel combination of classical kinetic theory and recent theories developed for nonlinear nonlocal integro-differential equations and degenerate nonlocal differential operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These low-frequency gravitational waves are the target of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav).  Professor Olum and his group will work to improve the mathematical and computational procedures used to analyze NANOGrav observations.

These enhancements will increase the significance of NANOGrav data analysis, possibly pushing it above the level at which the collaboration can confidently claim a discovery of a stochastic background of gravitational waves.  Faster codes will make it possible to check more carefully for possible ""false alarms"" and easier to explore new ideas that may extract important signals from the pulsar timing observations.

An increasing number of human-made chemicals are being released into the environment where they can deteriorate the water quality. Bacteria living in nature can secrete enzymes to degrade some of these chemicals and exploit them as carbon sources. However, the naturally occurring biodegradation process can be slow or inadequate to remove these contaminants. In this project, bacterial enzymes will be modified and optimized in the laboratory to speed up their degradation rates. The experimental results will be input data to train a computational model that simulates the interaction between the enzyme and the contaminant. In return, this computational model will promote the design of new enzymes with greater degradation rates. This project will initiate vigorous activities to engage graduate and undergraduate students, especially those who are members of underrepresented groups. Summer exchange workshops will be organized to promote communications between students and researchers from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Arizona State University. Outreach efforts will be made to promote the green treatment of water contaminants and technology innovation by combining laboratory-based enzyme evaluation and computation-based machine learning.<br/><br/>Some emerging contaminants pose imminent threats to public health and natural biota due to their frequent detection and enduring persistence in the environment. The project selects 1,4-dioxane (dioxane) as a model contaminant and employs state-of-the-art directed enzyme evaluation to gain fundamental biochemical insights into essential bacterial enzymes and ultimately optimize their biocatalytic performance for dioxane removal. Directed enzyme evolution will be used to mimic and accelerate the natural evolution in a laboratory setup, creating enzyme mutants with increased degradation efficiency towards dioxane. The rich empirical data set provided by directed enzyme evolution can be used to guide a machine learning process to predict key molecular determinants that link the protein sequence with its function and suggest new mutations for further improvement of their catalytic performance.

This radiation provided a sort of medium which affected long range forces and also how things propagate, the same way that water changes electric forces and the propagation of light. Because ever-more radiation was produced, its effects grew with time, and sometimes also with space. It is possible that remnants of these effects became strong enough to survive to the current day, and that they provide explanations for some of the puzzles which arise when one tries to understand the large scale Universe in terms of ordinary matter with Einstein?s theory of gravitation. The goal of this project is to develop reliable techniques for calculating these effects when they become strong, and modeling the results as changes in Einstein?s theory of gravitation. The project involves extensive international collaborations with physicists in the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Netherlands and Taiwan. The project provides summer support for two graduate students per year, whose education enhances the pool of STEM talent available to the United States. It should also be noted that, although the PI selects students on the basis of merit, over half of his past graduate students have been female or Hispanic.  <br/><br/>During the fall of 2021 the PI and collaborators showed that the large logarithms induced by nonlinear sigma models (whose derivative interactions mimic those of gravity) on de Sitter background can be summed up by combining variants of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism and the renormalization group. They also demonstrated that that the exchange potential of a massless, minimally coupled scalar (MMCS) provides the simplest venue for purging gauge dependence by including quantum gravitational correlations from the source and observer. The recent breakthrough on resummation, coupled with steady progress on approximating effective potentials in realistic geometries, has also provided important insights for expressing graviton loop corrections in terms of simple, nonlocal modifications of gravity. Finally, the effective potential results suggest a dramatic simplification for computations of reheating from longitudinal vectors. To exploit this recent progress the PI and his graduate students will continue their collaborations with Dr. Drazen Glavan (CEICO, Czech Republic), Prof. Cedric Deffayet (IAP, France), Prof. Shun-Pei Miao (NCKU, Taiwan), Prof. Tomislav Prokopec (U.

Mirror symmetry is a mysterious duality from string theory that links different fields of geometry on a manifold and its mirror image. These geometries are a priori unrelated to each other. Gravitational instantons are special four-dimensional manifolds that are the building blocks of quantum gravity theory in theoretical physics and important objects in different branches of mathematics. This project will mainly focus on gravitational instantons, starting by investigating their differential geometric aspects and then probing implications in enumerative geometry and algebraic geometry via mirror symmetry. Furthermore, the project will study how these implications feed back to differential geometry, aiming to unify the understanding of mirror symmetry from different aspects in geometry. The research will provide projects for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will continue to organize conferences and to illustrate practical applications of mathematics for undergraduate students to increase the pool of next generation geometers.<br/> <br/>The PI plans to use the SYZ geometry to bridge the connection between gravitational instantons, mirror symmetry, and enumerative geometry. Utilizing the SYZ fibrations already constructed in various gravitational instantons recently, the PI will investigate a full SYZ mirror symmetry, simultaneously governing both A-side and B-side geometry and coupled with the Landau-Ginzburg model. The PI will use it to understand the relation between hyper-Kähler rotation with mirror symmetry. On the other hand, the knowledge from the mirror symmetry will help to study the global metric description of log Calabi-Yau surfaces and the compactification of gravitational instantons, in return to the study of the moduli space of gravitational instantons. The metric perspective of the gravitational instantons will lead to explicit calculation of local open Gromov-Witten invariants in enumerative geometry and concrete examples for comparing the family Floer mirrors and Gross-Siebert/Gross-Hacking-Keel-Siebert mirror constructions. A byproduct of the understanding of the metric description of the geometry is various new constructions of minimal Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau manifolds. Some parts of the techniques are expected to provide steppingstones for probing the Calabi-Yau three-fold geometry with fibration structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the various flood-related risks, flood-borne debris can be destructive to coastal infrastructure (e.g., buildings, houses, and bridges). Such debris (e.g. trees, cars, and ships) are carried by floods and waves, often in combination with extreme wind gusts. Currently, there is a significant gap in understanding and modeling the key physical processes associated with flood-borne debris. This project will provide a science-based approach to understand and predict the flood-borne debris damages to structures under extreme flood flow and wind conditions. The research will also be complemented by an educational component that includes workshops, curriculum development, and training demonstrations. The educational program will be designed to have positive and measurable impact on a broad spectrum of students (ranging from high school to graduate students), foster an increased participation among minority and underrepresented groups, and inform students of the novel research and diverse cultures of the three participating institutions, i.e., Columbia University, SUNY at Stony Brook, and CUNY City College.

Floquet state spectroscopy is the fully coherent optical analogue of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy, which uses radio waves to interact with atoms and molecules, is used extensively in science and technology because of its ability to characterize complex samples. Floquet state spectroscopy promises similar capabilities using light, rather than radio waves, to interact with molecules. The goal of this project is to apply Floquet state spectroscopy to a range of chemical systems that are important in practical applications of chemistry. For example, Professor Wright and his team use the technique to determine how the atoms within a molecule must bend, twist, and stretch in order to change the bonds that hold the molecule together. This information forms the heart of synthetic chemistry because it identifies the mechanisms responsible for a reaction. The team also works with collaborators from academic, industrial, and government laboratories to demonstrate the unique capabilities of Floquet state spectroscopy for characterizing complex materials and to show how the technique can be applied in many fields of science and technology. The broader impacts of the project include wide dissemination of this new technology, student training opportunities, and a collaboration with Spelman College that engages minority students in summer research projects on Floquet state spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Floquet state spectroscopy measures the response of a system based on simultaneously driven multiple vibrational and electronic molecular states. The resulting quantum mechanically entangled superposition state emits light according to the wavevector combinations of the Floquet states. Scanning the driving frequencies across resonances of a molecule results in multiplicative enhancements of the output light beams and thus provides a way to measure multidimensional spectra. A primary focus of this research project is using Floquet state spectroscopy to probe the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Creating a Floquet state that contains the same vibrational and electronic states as those driven by chaotic thermal motions allows direct observation and control of a reaction. Cobalamin and a Ru-Ru metal-metal complex are two model compounds that the team is using to test the ability of Floquet state spectroscopy to probe reaction mechanisms. In cobalamin, the challenge is to understand the factors responsible for the 12-orders of magnitude change in the scission rate of the C-Co bond upon binding with a substrate. In the ruthenium complex, the challenge is understanding the mechanism for the amination of C-H bonds. Dissemination of the technology includes working with collaborators to apply Floquet state spectroscopy for complex polymeric materials characterization, disposal of actinide nuclear waste in glasses, femtosecond stimulated Raman studies of photochemical reactions, and development of medical diagnostics for pancreatic cancer. Additional broader impacts include advanced training for graduate students as well as the efforts to broaden participation through the collaboration with Spelman College.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, many networks vary over time. For example, contact networks change from one shape to another as people move around to meet different people. Friendship networks also vary over time on a longer timescale. Such temporal (i.e., time-varying) network data have been increasingly available, and mathematically founded methods that can efficiently summarize complex temporal network data to help enhance intuitive understanding of the data are desirable. The Principal Investigator (PI) will develop methods to map temporal network data to trajectories in a space. Specifically, the methods will enable representation of the network at a given time point succinctly as a point on the trajectory. This is a drastic reduction, but in this manner aims to capture gross properties of the data and potentially use them for data mining tasks such as visualization, anomaly detection, and discovery of hidden periodicity. The PI will then build mathematical foundations of the proposed methods and apply them to empirical data. The proposed methods are expected to find applications in online social network services, financial transactions, bibliographic citation data, neuroimaging data, and climate temporal networks, to name a few. Furthermore, the project outcomes are expected to encourage researchers in data science and engineering to work on various algorithms related to network embedding (e.g., use of deep learning architecture). In this manner, the project relates to multiple research communities and industries. <br/><br/>The methods to be developed in this project are temporal network embedding (TNE) methods. In contrast with most TNE methods available to date, in which one embeds nodes into a latent space, the class of TNE methods the PI will pursue is a mapping from the space of networks to a low-dimensional latent space. A fundamental challenge to TNE is that empirical data usually come in the form of a set of time-stamped events between pairs of nodes, which would generate an extremely sparse network at any given time, hampering sensible network analyses. To overcome this situation, the PI will combine the modeling framework called tie-decay temporal networks with a Nystrom family of general-purpose dimension reduction methods to establish a family of TNE methods. This particular combination of techniques will allow the PI to narrow down the methodological choice, such as which dimension reduction methods, network distance measures, and tie-decay functions should be used, as well as to facilitate efficient computations and mathematical investigations. The PI will then develop mathematical foundations of the proposed methods such as continuity, responses to Markovian inputs, and sensitivity to perturbation in the input data. Finally, the PI will showcase the methods by applying them to social and financial empirical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These spaces model real world objects, and low dimensional topology is highly relevant to other scientific disciplines. For instance, several homology theories, that are fundamental constructions in topology, have been used to analyze datasets in the field of data analysis. In addition, topology plays an essential role in formulating modern theories in physics. Perhaps more surprisingly, tools from modern physics, more specifically quantum filed theory, have yielded significant progresses in low dimensional topology. This NSF award provides support for projects that promote systematic application of ideas in physics to topology and vice versa. The PI aims to investigate applications of the Yang-Mills theory of high energy physics in the topological properties of three-and four-dimensional objects. As a step toward this goal, the PI will further develop homology theories that he  constructed together with his collaborators. The research also partly focuses on foundational questions in symplectic geometry, a field with close ties with physics. Last but not the least, the project will support training of graduate students and early career researchers in the field of topology through mentoring, conference and workshop organization, and dissemination of expository materials.

This conjecture states that one can apply methods from symplectic geometry to define three-manifold invariants.

In the long term, such studies have the potential to open up new vistas for biomedical science, by providing enabling tools to study processes in cells and biological tissues without perturbing the biology. Such complexes might, for example, provide a new means of analyzing metabolic processes or the reactivity of metalloenzymes in living tissues, thereby introducing new readouts for both healthy cell biology and dysfunctional cell biology, as a possible diagnostic tool.<br/><br/>While selected examples of Ln(III)-upconversion emission in the solid state exist, the parameters for efficient upconversion emission in solution are not well established. To probe these parameters, the Gordon research team will isolate multi-metallic Ln(III)-ion complexes with water-soluble naphthylsalophen-based ligands and pre-organized supramolecular structures and characterize their photophysical properties. Ln(III)-ions have characteristic line-like spectra with long-lived emission, which can be easily distinguished from background fluorescence. Importantly, toxicity and low cell penetrability are not inherent concerns with Ln(III)-complexes and the emission properties of these complexes are not dependent on their crystalline phase. To realize upconversion emission, a combination of Yb(III) and Er(III) or Nd(III) and Er(III) in the complexes is needed, requiring careful balance of the necessary stoichiometry. Using judiciously designed systems, Dr. Gordon and her team will tune the properties of the Ln(III)-ion complexes for improved solubility, biocompatibility, and photophysical properties. Optimally, such probes should be water-soluble, display high emission efficiencies at emission wavelengths that are easily discriminated from tissue and cell fluorescence, and should be excited at wavelengths that are not absorbed by or damaging to biological tissues. This work is expected to contribute to better understanding of the  structure-luminescence relationship that leads to increased upconversion emission in the solid state and in solution.  The insights gained from this work have the potential to help guide the design and development of effective new luminescent probes, ultimately for applications in biological imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many research efforts, such as improving the fuel efficiency of tires, require an understanding of friction and adhesion, which have important consequences in terms of energy savings. There is also a strong need for improving adhesion in wet environments for biomedical applications such as bandages, tissue adhesives, and health monitoring devices. The main challenge in these applications is understanding how roughness can affect adhesion and friction. This research project is focused on measuring the actual area of contact between a soft polymer that has elastic properties (such as rubber) and a rough surface, as this measure is critical for gaining insight on the magnitude of the forces of friction and adhesion.  The project will involve the use of sophisticated optical instruments and the further development of techniques to directly probe the contact area between the elastomer and the surface during sliding under both dry conditions and under water.  These direct measurements of the contact area will help in developing a fundamental understanding of the velocity dependence of friction and adhesion and will be useful in testing the current theoretical models in this field.  Two graduate students will be trained during this project, and research experiences will be provided to undergraduate and high school students as part of the outreach activities. The project will also leverage the Biomimicry Center (BRIC) at the University of Akron to improve the diversity of students engaged in science projects and increase participation of students from inner-city schools. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>It was first highlighted by David Tabor and colleagues that both adhesion and friction are related to the real contact area and the strength of interfacial adhesion. In the last two decades, new analytical models have been developed to predict how the real contact area is influenced by roughness, elastic modulus, and the sliding velocity. Recently, it has been shown that these models are inadequate for predicting changes in friction due to roughness or changes in the sliding velocity for soft elastomers. Resolving the discrepancy between theory and experiments will require a direct measurement of the real contact area, particularly during sliding. The proposed research will leverage recent developments in surface-sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) to directly measure the shift in the surface -OH peak, which can be related to the strength of the interfacial interactions. SFG will be coupled with an oscillatory friction cell (with a velocity in the range of 10-7 to 0.2 m/s) to directly measure the contact area during sliding. These measurements will be conducted in both dry conditions and underwater to understand the influence of hydrodynamics in the boundary lubrication regime. The direct measurement of the contact area will help in developing a fundamental understanding of the velocity dependence of friction and adhesion and will be useful in testing the current theoretical models in this field.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will advance understanding of how complex life has evolved. Many living organisms, including plants and animals, depend on cooperative interactions between many cells that carry out specific and important functions. These complex organisms are referred to as multicellular. In contrast, other organisms have remained unicellular and do not depend on cooperative cellular interactions to persist. Previous research suggests complex multicellularity has not evolved for some organisms because cells choose to act selfishly rather than cooperate with one another. The conditions that favor and inhibit the evolution and persistence of cooperative multicellular interactions remains an outstanding question in the field of evolutionary biology. This research will address this knowledge gap by determining the conditions under which more complex organisms evolve. Addressing this question is important to improving our understanding of how multicellular life arose on Earth, and why there is so much variation in multicellular complexity across the tree of life. The Fellow will mentor students from underrepresented groups in research as well as through public outreach activities. <br/><br/>This research will test the hypothesis that integration in aggregative multicellular organisms is limited by an eco-evolutionary trade-off: unstable environments favor social generalism, which limits the evolution of genotype-specific multicellular integration. The research will use synthetic biology to generate a laboratory model system of aggregative multicellularity, engineering the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to require obligate metabolic cross-feeding. Aggregative yeast will be experimentally coevolved to examine how the fidelity of their mutualistic partners affects the evolution of genotype-genotype specialization. The ecological implications of specialization will then be assessed by testing for fitness tradeoffs associated with specialists and generalists. These results will be placed in a broader context by using a theoretical model to evaluate the effect of environmental heterogeneity on the evolution of multicellularity. The Fellow predicts that increased complexity will evolve when there are increased opportunities for specialization between coevolved cells. Fellow training includes metabolomics, microscopy, and mathematical modeling at Georgia Tech. The Fellow will also broaden participation in science by mentoring first-generation and low-income undergraduates in scientific research and by developing hands-on scientific activities for underrepresented elementary school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the various flood-related risks, flood-borne debris can be destructive to coastal infrastructure (e.g., buildings, houses, and bridges). Such debris (e.g. trees, cars, and ships) are carried by floods and waves, often in combination with extreme wind gusts. Currently, there is a significant gap in understanding and modeling the key physical processes associated with flood-borne debris. This project will provide a science-based approach to understand and predict the flood-borne debris damages to structures under extreme flood flow and wind conditions. The research will also be complemented by an educational component that includes workshops, curriculum development, and training demonstrations. The educational program will be designed to have positive and measurable impact on a broad spectrum of students (ranging from high school to graduate students), foster an increased participation among minority and underrepresented groups, and inform students of the novel research and diverse cultures of the three participating institutions, i.e., Columbia University, SUNY at Stony Brook, and CUNY City College.   This award will contribute to the National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to understand and quantify the critical mechanics processes involved in water-wind-debris-structure interactions, including debris drifting by extreme flow and wind conditions, debris collision with the structure, and the resulting damages. A multidisciplinary approach employing computational fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, and laboratory experiments will be used to achieve this goal. Specific research tasks include: (1) innovative experiments deploying ?smart debris? to investigate wind and transport effects of flood-borne debris and their impact/damage to structures, (2) new computational methods and software for an integrated simulation of debris drifting, impingement, and damage to structures, and (3) novel physics-based fragility curves, at the system level, for structural failure risk assessment due to debris impacts. In the long term, this research can lead to enhanced designs and mitigation strategies for structures susceptible to the impact of flood and debris, advancing the well-being of the public through development of resilient coastlines and communities.

The study identifies key interactions between the protein and nanoparticle that can be exploited to prevent protein unfolding and to facilitate controlled release from the nanoparticle surface. Professor Driskell and his students are chemically modifying proteins to install chemical anchors with high affinity for the gold nanoparticles and measuring the stability and biological function of the adsorbed protein layer. Their discoveries could lead to predictive design parameters to form robust and highly functional protein-nanoparticle probes and broadly impact modern biosensing, medical imaging, drug delivery, and biocatalysis. This project provides support for undergraduate students to participate in an immersive research experience to learn advanced analytical techniques and gain an appreciation for a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving. Additionally, in collaboration with the Illinois Research Academy, Dr. Driskell and his supported undergraduate students provide high school students with an intense, yet supervised, research experience. <br/><br/>A detailed understanding of the protein-nanoparticle interface is critical to mitigate structural changes that negatively impact the function of the adsorbed protein and to leverage stabilizing interactions that enhance protein function. Surface accessible thiols on a protein are hypothesized to be primarily responsible for the adsorption onto gold nanoparticles and the formation of a hard corona; thus, the ability to precisely control the number of protein thiols can be exploited to optimize bioconjugate function. A synthetic strategy is proposed to install thiol functional groups on a series of enzymes. The reaction conditions are optimized to precisely control the number of thiols, and monitored by high-resolution mass spectrometry, zeta potential, and Ellman?s reagent. Adsorption affinity, quantitatively assessed using nanoparticle tracking analysis, and protein exchange rate, measured via a competitive protein binding, is correlated with the number of surface accessible thiols presented by the protein. Additionally, the structure and function of the free and nanoparticle-immobilized protein is compared to identify any relationship between protein thiolation and protein structure/function upon adsorption to a nanoparticle.

While the abundance of such data is advantageous, it brings forth several computational challenges. One challenge is the fact that data might contain numerous missing entries. This is the case for instance when using physical measurement devices with a limited range or in collecting user preferences for a product where we lack complete information. One line of methods that has proved to be useful for this problem is matrix completion algorithms which predict missing entries with minimalistic assumptions on the data. However, in problems such as structure prediction and recommendation system with side information, the measurements are not entry-wise. Specifically, the observations are an aggregate of some entries of the underlying data, i.e., rather than directly observing the entries of the data, the user has access to certain combinations of these entries. This project aims to study this problem which is well known as the matrix sensing problem. The majority of previous works consider the case where measurements of the data are missing at random or assume that the measurement protocol itself is random. Motivated by practical applications, this project considers a realistic setup where the measurements are structured and deterministic. A key goal of this project is to advance the state of art theory and computation of matrix sensing by studying new optimization algorithms. Another aim of the project is to apply the constructed framework to robust structure prediction and machine learning. <br/><br/>This project seeks to study scalable non-convex methods for a class of generalized matrix recovery problems. In particular, PIs are interested in low-rank matrix sensing problems with deterministically structured measurements under various settings. The main approach is based on formulating the optimization problem with respect to a deterministic measurement basis and its associated dual basis. This yields a well-posed problem under some mild conditions. The project is centered on three objectives. In the first part, the project studies the local convergence of a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm that directly optimizes over the manifold of low-rank matrices. The recovery guarantee then will depend mainly on the spectral properties of the basis and the dual basis, the sampling scheme, and the initialization. Tight estimation of the spectral properties and effective initialization method will be investigated by bridging connections to spectral graph theory. The second objective is to design an algorithm tailored for the Euclidean distance geometry (EDG) problem which aims to estimate the configuration of points given partial information about pairwise distances. EDG is a representative problem that utilizes deterministically structured measurements. By leveraging the special structure of EDG, the project aims to design optimally efficient algorithms and establish theoretical analysis for the exact recovery of the point configuration. The third objective considers the setting where the measurements might be sparsely corrupted. The project aims to develop fast and robust algorithms tailored to this case and carry out the necessary analysis for recovery guarantees. To realize these objectives, the project leverages tools from high-dimensional probability, Riemannian optimization, numerical analysis, and spectral graph theory. The project will provide opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students with interests in distance geometry, optimization theory, and computational science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stochastic control theory and its enhancement, mean field control theory, also allow the systematic incorporation of noise and uncertainty while simultaneously providing satisfactory performance. Mean field control theory is ideally suited for studying deep neural networks of machine learning because it is designed to handle large numbers of agents, neurons, or complex data. In addition, the machine learning rules provided by it are expected to be easier to implement and interpret than would be the case with other methods. The project will provide new applications of machine learning and data science to situations wherein classical machine learning would be prohibitively expensive to apply. The main tool of the project naturally lends itself to study the impact of adversaries and is thus well suited to ensuring privacy. The project will also provide training opportunities to several Ph.D. students and the workforce in this area by developing courses and educational materials. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate mean field games and mean field control in the context of supervised learning and deep learning.

This will allow handling the gradients more efficiently. The investigators will analyze how a stochastic gradient algorithm is replaced by a mean field control or a mean field game.

Our daily use of smartphones, appliances, and social media can engender pleasurable moments, but they do not inherently lead to improved well-being. People adapt to the joys of using technologies, then find them mundane. Some positive emotions can cause deconstructive behaviors, such as over-engagement on social media. The project investigates designing technologies to support positive emotion regulation in young adults, a population whose mental health can be impacted by limited emotion regulation skills and challenges to accessing traditional health interventions. Practical design methods and tools for the development of such technologies are being generated by incorporating perspectives of design professionals through a series of co-creative workshops and seminars. A toolkit and methods reflecting insights into emotion regulation is being developed and disseminated to help designers create innovative and evidence-based emotion-managing technologies. The project promotes STEM education for underserved students through novel community-engagement programs that encourage students to think critically about how everyday technologies shape human emotion and behavior.<br/><br/>The project explores how positive emotions can be effectively regulated through technology and how technology-mediated positive emotions can contribute to well-being. While traditional research assumes a direct impact of technology on user emotions (e.g., manipulation of an artifact?s appearance), this project builds on findings that the impact of technology on emotion regulation is indirect, because it is mediated by users? activities (e.g., visualizing positive things one did/will do with the technology). Through co-creative, research-through-design methods, the project investigates positive emotion regulation by: (1) analyzing the roles of everyday technology in reinforcing and prolonging positive emotional experiences; (2) developing interactive digital and tangible artifact prototypes (e.g., interactive installations, IoT devices, and apps); (3) evaluating prototypes? effects on well-being; and (4) translating resulting insights into design methods and tools that support the development of PER technologies to promote well-being.

Black carbon (BC) is also associated with human health problems such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Thus, it is essential to know concentrations of CO2 and BC and have a clear understanding of direct radiative forcing (DRF) due to CO2 and black carbon at a city level. Current radiative forcing is estimated at a regional or global level due to limited concentration measurements of CO2 and BC. The objective of this study is to examine temporal variations of CO2 and BC at one urban site and develop a unique approach to estimate radiative forcing at a city level. The findings from this project will help better understand larger uncertainties in climate change prediction by various climate models. Also, this research exposes both graduate and undergraduate students to real-life environmental problems and provides them great opportunities to learn quantitative skills used in the fields of environmental science. This will in turn help increase the number of minority students who will pursue STEM degrees.<br/><br/>In this project, one Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFR-7) will be used to measure total, diffuse, and direct irradiance at six wavelengths at one urban site and one ObservAir® sensor will be used to monitor BC, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations.

A common goal in these situations is to obtain the limit of the sequence inexpensively. As a simple example, there are several ways to generate a sequence of numbers that converge to the number pi and some sequences will reach the limit pi rather quickly. In some cases, it may be possible to modify the original method that produced the sequence to obtain a faster converging one. However, this is not always possible or cost-effective because the process by which the sequence is produced is not explicit or it may be too cumbersome for this approach to be practical. Another common solution is to transform the sequence, by 'accelerating it'. This usually entails combining the terms of the sequence to produce new entries that reach the limit faster. So far, acceleration methods were developed by mathematicians and (quantum) physicists to deal with a wide range of problems from the physical sciences. The primary goal of this project is to study such acceleration methods and to adapt them to the modern era by focusing on topics related to machine learning and, more generally, data sciences. This collaborative research project between researchers at Emory University and the University of Minnesota, will develop and study theoretically a number of robust acceleration algorithms with an emphasis on problems that stem from data-related applications, as well as train graduate students in this field of study. <br/><br/>The need to accelerate numerical sequences of various types has frequently been felt across a wide range of disciplines and it has been addressed by many researchers for quite some time. In the past, such acceleration or extrapolation schemes were targeted mainly toward sequences of vectors that arise from physical simulations, e.g., the sequence of potentials generated by the Self Consistent Field (SCF) iterations in quantum physics. In recent years, the rapid expansion of machine learning methodologies across a great variety of disciplines has generated new demand for algorithms to accelerate sequences of various types. However, the new type of sequences encountered in these applications differ in fundamental ways from their analogues in physical simulations. In contrast with the common setting required in, e.g., quantum physics, calculations in machine learning are often performed in single or half precision instead of double precision. Furthermore, in neural networks these sequences tend to be very irregular because they originate from stochastic gradient  approaches. The collaborative team from Emory University and the University of Minnesota, will develop and study theoretically a number of robust acceleration algorithms with an emphasis on their application to irregular sequences such as those encountered in data-related applications. The investigating team will study a number of strategies for improving the robustness of standard acceleration schemes, such as Anderson mixing, or the epsilon algorithm. A number of recently advocated second-order methods, based on (so-called) momentum ideas, have been shown to be of great help in accelerating standard stochastic gradient descent methods in Deep Learning. The investigators will add to these schemes another method of the same class that is grounded in Chebyshev acceleration. One advantage of the Chebyshev-based scheme is that it is fairly easy to study theoretically in part because it is well understood for linear problems. In a second research direction, the investigating team will study acceleration methods in the specific context of machine learning tasks. For example, inspired by recent advances in parameter averaging and variance reduction schemes they will explore the application of classical extrapolation methods to stochastic gradient sequences as an adaptive extrapolation procedure. Experiments show that parameter averaging is key to the success of acceleration procedures. Just as important is the selection of the vectors to accelerate.

Nature provides an abundance of biopolymers such as cellulose and starch which are typically benign and can degrade to water and carbon dioxide in the environment. They can be chemically modified to produce, for example, broadly useful cellulose derivatives that are widely employed by society, including in medicines. Getting a medicine into the body by swallowing a tablet is becoming increasingly difficult because few modern drugs easily dissolve in water. It is important that a drug can be dissolved from a tablet in the right region of the digestive system so that it can be absorbed and exert its therapeutic effects on the body. Biopolymers can be used to help improve drug solubility and release. However, because new generations of drugs are increasingly difficult to absorb, it is important to understand more about how polymers dissolve and release their cargo, and how to chemically modify these polymers to make them even more effective at delivering drugs and other poorly soluble additives. This research investigates how polymers interact with water, and how this in turn impacts the rate of polymer dissolution. Polymers will be mixed with water-hating additives (many drugs can be described as water-hating), revealing how this changes dissolution. Finally, new biopolymer derivatives will be designed that maintain a good interaction with water, even in the presence of water-hating additives. The goal is to develop polymers that are more effective than existing polymers at releasing poorly water-soluble drugs (and other additives). Broad impacts of this work include training graduate and undergraduate students including under-represented minorities and women, including developing a professional skills program for graduate students.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Polymer dissolution is both fundamentally and practically important. It differs significantly from small molecule dissolution and is often problematic. Key issues include slow or poorly controlled dissolution, and undesired gelation. Systems that also contain small molecule additives are common, for example amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) for enhancement of aqueous solubility of hydrophobic additives. In these systems, mismatch of additive and polymer dissolution rates can lead to system failure (e.g. additive precipitation). Fundamental understanding of how additives impact polymer dissolution is lacking. Herein, we propose to elucidate the impact of additives on the rate limiting steps of biopolymer dissolution, in particular for polysaccharide (PS) derivatives, whose benign nature and potential for modification make them well suited for polymer/additive systems of technical importance. A set of novel PS derivatives will be designed and synthesized to test key hypotheses about the importance of hydration extent, as well as the impacts of specific functional groups upon dissolution rate. Selective PS oxidation and halogenation will permit substitution with omega-amino and omega-mercaptocarboxylic acids. PS dissolution rates will be measured in the presence and absence of model additives; tests of impact of ionization, counterion size/nature, and steric hindrance will reveal whether hydration rate/extent is the key rate limiting step. By elucidating polymer structural features necessary for release, the goal is to develop new oral delivery systems for poorly water-soluble compounds. Students will collaborate to elucidate rate-limiting steps in polymer dissolution, synthesize and characterize polymers, test dissolution rates with and without carefully selected additives, and apply the generated fundamental understanding to refine theory and enhance polymer design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making effective data-driven decisions is a challenging problem studied by the reinforcement learning community. Despite their success in simulated domains, like board games, existing reinforcement learning algorithms are still too unreliable for widespread deployment. This project develops new reinforcement learning algorithms that achieve reliability by carefully balancing the expected quality of recommended decisions with their risk of failure. The risk of failure is measured using techniques from stochastic finance, which enable flexible and efficient algorithms. These new, reliable algorithms will help bring data-driven decision-making to new domains, including agriculture, ecological management, and medicine. The research is integrated with educational activities to provide graduate and undergraduate students with training opportunities and new study materials, including a textbook. <br/><br/>This research develops and analyzes algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) problems with 1) limited or expensive data and 2) a high cost of failure.

First, the project will establish soft-robust RL formulations' statistical and computational properties. Second, the project will generate a new class of tabular soft-robust RL algorithms built on new insights into the relationship between soft-robustness and robust Markov decision processes.

Topological matter is a new class of materials, which exhibit uniquely robust physical properties that are exceptionally stable to environmental effects. This property opens the door for many potential applications in measurement science, and more importantly, quantum information. These applications are related to the existence of elusive particles called anyons. <br/><br/>We normally think of electrons as having no parts. Yet, in topological matter they often behave as if they were made of composite particles called anyons. These anyons are promising for building the fundamental components of a quantum computer, in which topological protection would help reduce otherwise unavoidable computational errors introduced by the material's interaction with its environment. The nature and even the existence of anyons in many systems remain hotly debated. The primary focus of this award is to develop ways to probe the existence and nature of anyons. So far, various electronic experiments have been proposed and implemented for this purpose. Yet, electronic tools have significant limitations and do not work in systems that do not conduct electricity. However, this is not a limitation for heat transport. The key idea of this project consists of focusing on heat transport (rather than electronic transport) to understand anyons, and hence, topological matter.  <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through research training of undergraduate and graduate students, writing pedagogical review articles, organization of conferences and workshops, and outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research, education, and outreach activities aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of heat transport in topological matter. The last several years have witnessed several breakthroughs in the experimental detection of quantized thermal conductance, including the observation of its fractional quantization, which gives evidence of non-Abelian anyons. Yet, many aspects of topological heat transport remain poorly understood. <br/><br/>The project has two research thrusts. The first one focuses on the problems of heat dissipation and the interplay of the charge and heat transport, which are crucial for the interpretation of the experimental data. The second thrust builds on the idea of thermal interferometry of anyons. Interferometry is the most direct way to probe fractional statistics.  During the last two years, there has been dramatic progress in the experimental implementation of interferometry of charged anyons. Building on these recent developments, this project will extend the idea of anyonic interferometry to neutral anyons and to systems that do not support electric currents. The project will address several related problems in interferometry of charged and neutral anyons and in topological heat transport at ultra-low temperatures. The technical approaches will combine conformal field theory, Keldysh technique, algebraic theory of anyons, refermionization, Bethe ansatz, and other tools. The research will benefit from interaction with experimentalists from the Weizmann Institute of Science. <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the STEM workforce in the US through research training of undergraduate and graduate students, writing pedagogical review articles, organization of conferences and workshops, and outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms can cause severe problems, including medical infections, fouling, and clogging in industrial applications. In contrast, biofilms play beneficial roles in wastewater treatment and microbial fuel cells. Scientists have been able to characterize the chemical components of biofilms but don?t know yet how an active, self-renewable, and self-healing material emerges from these components and their interactions. How can scientists use their vast knowledge of man-made polymers to understand these natural polymers? Are there new physical mechanisms to be discovered in the way bacteria build their biofilm communities? To answer these questions, this project aims to reveal the secrets of how biofilms derive mechanical properties from their individual components by integrating state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, and computer simulations. Through these fundamental studies, scientists can design better strategies that either eliminate harmful biofilms or use beneficial biofilms to create useful structures. By integrating multiple disciplines, this project will train a diverse group of students in the areas of biology, physics, materials science, and engineering, and prepare them for the next-generation workforce. The educational objectives of the project will be realized through curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, and K-12 outreach programs, with special efforts to involve underrepresented students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacteria embedded in a matrix made of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The overarching goal of this project is to integrate state-of-the-art mechanical measurement, single-cell imaging, mutagenesis, computer simulations, and soft matter theory to address how, at different time and length scales, bacterial cells build communities with emerging mechanical properties. Specifically, the three research objectives are to (i) establish EPS as associative polymers crosslinked by matrix proteins, (ii) reveal the contribution of bacterial cells to biofilm mechanics, and (iii) measure the development of biofilm mechanics and heterogeneity at the single-cell level. These objectives are accomplished via experiments involving rheological testing, high-resolution imaging, protein biochemistry, bacterial genetics, and multiscale modeling. The broader impacts of this work are to help produce a diverse STEM-capable workforce by incorporating central concepts addressed in this project into education and outreach activities that expose and engage students in biology, materials science, physics, and engineering. The education and outreach activities center on the following three objectives: (i) expanding the Pathways to Science program for local high school students, (ii) incorporating research findings into the curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate courses, and (iii) providing research experiences to underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These impacts continue to mount, especially in rapidly developing coastal areas most influenced by the adverse effects of climate change. A new generation of graduates is needed that have the training and skillsets to address this problem that has already been causing catastrophic episodes of flooding and its associated hardship every year in the United States alone. The International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) Flood Resilience Program (FRP) between the U.S. and the Netherlands will fill this critical need by implementing a place-based integrative research and educational program in science and engineering to help produce a diverse generation of researchers and practitioners equipped to solve complex problems related to flood risk reduction in the U.S. and around the world. Each year of the program, eight U.S. students (4 undergrad and 4 grad) will engage in an immersive, six-week problem-and place-based research experience in the Netherlands, a world leader in flood risk mitigation and management. Existing partnerships established among multiple institutions, researchers, and students in both countries will be leveraged to provide students with international research experiences under the guidance of faculty and researchers from multiple disciplines in both countries. Key U.S. partners include Texas A&M University at Galveston (TAMUG) and College Station (TAMU) campuses, Jackson State University (JSU), and University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez (UPRM). Dutch partners include Delft University of Technology (main host), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Rijkswaterstaat. Students will conduct research projects covering both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems in both urban and coastal areas. The effectiveness of structural and non-structural strategies will be investigated, leading to a better understanding of when to pursue strategies for mitigating adverse impacts from flood events. U.S. researchers and students will be able to leverage Dutch data, methods, and facilities associated with flood management. The IRES FRP will prepare the next generation of engineers and scientists that will have to tackle the societal problem of widespread flooding in an innovative fashion. Furthermore, the program will create quantitative data on specific educational techniques and methods to improve student learning outcomes as part of place-based research settings.<br/><br/>Problem-and place-based case studies involving the Houston-Galveston and Rotterdam-The Hague Metropolitan areas, respectively, will integrate researchers and faculty with expertise in engineering (TAMU/JSU/UPRM/TUD), coastal structures (TUD/RWS), architecture (TUD), economics (VU) and planning (TAMUG) to guide student projects addressing the following overarching research questions: 1) what are the underlying characteristics of physical flood resilience and the differences between the two countries; 2) why are urban communities and the associated built environment so vulnerable to flood impacts; and 3) which mitigation techniques, both structural and non-structural are being implemented in the Netherlands and what can be applied in the U.S.? Students will select research projects covering both surge-based and precipitation-driven flood problems. The effectiveness of both structural and non-structural strategies will be investigated, leading to a better understanding of when to pursue avoidance or resistance strategies for mitigating adverse impacts from flood events. U.S. researchers and students will be able to leverage Dutch data, methods, facilities, and expertise, associated with flood management. The primary goal of the program will be to provide participating students with interdisciplinary problem- and place-based international research experiences by creating ?authentic transformative learning environments?. Participating students will learn ?how to conduct research? in general and ?how to approach a problem through different disciplinary lenses.? The program will prepare the next generation of engineers and scientists in academia and practice that will have to tackle the societal problem of flooding in an innovative fashion. Furthermore, the program will create quantitative data on specific educational techniques and methods to improve student learning outcomes as part of place-based research settings. These findings will lead to improved future international research exchange programs and be incorporated into teaching strategies at all partner institutions. Emphasis will be placed on actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program at all collaborating institutions. Broad representation across society is particularly important for effective strategies to flood-related problems since the impacts of floods are disproportionate to vulnerable populations and flood-related lived experiences of underrepresented groups may provide the spark to pursue related higher STEM education. PIs at TAMU, UPRM and JSU, a designated HBCU, have experience with recruitment of underrepresented groups that will be brought to bear for this proposal.

The fluorescence coming from a single QD is not constant, but rather exhibits periods of light emission followed by periods of darkness. In short, they blink. Blinking is a universal behavior of QDs and understanding its mechanism is critical to many applications.  However, determining the blinking mechanism is challenging because it must be studied in one QD at a time, and one must study many QDs to draw meaningful conclusions. To address this challenge, Professors Zhao, Chen, and Chen along with their students will apply modern statistical learning approaches to analyze fluorescence blinking in many perovskite QDs with varying compositions. The discoveries could have implications for how QDs are used in applications ranging from LED displays to biological imaging. The research methods and findings will be integrated into outreach activities and virtual chemistry laboratory modules, as well as workshops introducing data science techniques to chemistry students.<br/><br/>The project will apply modern statistical learning and data science approaches to analyze fluorescence fluctuations in single perovskite QDs with the goal of gaining mechanistic insight that is free of the implicit bias often encountered when interpreting data from single-particle measurements.

A mathematical space can be characterized by both local and global information, such as how curved it is (local) and how connected it is (global). As a subfield, symplectic geometry studies a special kind of space called a symplectic manifold. These spaces are all the same locally but can have a variety of global shapes. The main tools of study fall into two categories: algebraic and analytic. The algebraic tools are the frameworks of wrapping up global information and making calculations, while the analytic tools are techniques for solving differential equations and for constructing the algebraic frameworks. This research project aims to improve existing techniques and develop new tools to solve longstanding difficult questions, with emphasis on analytic methods. At the same time, the project will enrich the K-12 outreach (Math Circle) program at Texas A&M University, build a community of researchers in Texas and Central South America, and enhance connections among mathematics faculty and students. <br/><br/>On the technical level, the project involves three topics. First, using the technique of virtual cycle and adiabatic limit, the research aims to establish the relationship between Witten's gauged linear sigma model and the nonlinear sigma model. In contrast to many algebraic approaches, the method is analytic, allowing one to extend to the open-string case where algebraic methods are not yet available. Second, using a new method, the PI plans to prove compactness results in situations where traditional approaches do not apply. This includes a compactness result in Atiyah-Floer conjecture, compactness for pseudoholomorphic curves regarding reversed surgery for cleanly-intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds, and compactness for pseudoholomorphic curves with certain singular Lagrangian boundary conditions. Third, the project aims to develop a new counting method to define Gromov-Witten invariants and Floer homology over integers.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The fellow will research the evolution and ecology of microbiomes, which are complex microbial communities critical for proper ecosystem functioning and the health of the complex organisms they often associate with. In agriculture, plant-associated microbiomes have been demonstrated to influence plant health and response to environmental factors. This project will work towards establishing the modes of microbiome evolution and their consequences on plant fitness in order to establish agricultural practices that maintain both plant and microbiome health for greater crop management and food production. Currently, the global demand for food is expected to increase by 35-56% in the next 30 years, highlighting the need for the reevaluation of agricultural practices such that plant-microbiome fitness as well as agricultural productivity and sustainability are maximized. To this end, it is imperative that we understand the factors that influence microbiome evolution and their effects on plant-microbiome interactions, adaptation, and fitness.<br/><br/>By leveraging experimental coevolution approaches, this project will determine whether a microbiome?s previous selection environment influences microbial community assembly, function, and adaptive potential when associated with a new plant host. Specifically, the fellow seeks to answer two questions: (1) does a microbial community?s previous associations with heterospecific or conspecific plant hosts influence community adaptation on subsequent hosts?; and (2) what are the consequences of microbiome adaptation to common agricultural chemicals on microbiome function and plant host fitness?

After coevolution, the genetic and functional changes of the microbial community and the fitness of the host plant will be evaluated to uncover how and when microbiome origin and interaction history will affect microbiome evolution and plant-host fitness.

Riverside is exploring how magnetic fields can drive nanoparticles to assemble into larger structures that have an inherent ?handedness,? analogous to the left-right mirror symmetry seen in many living organisms. Since structures with different handedness interact with light differently, this property is very useful for decoding the fine structures of many important biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. However, practical applications in sensing and detection based on this property face significant challenges due to subtle differences in light-molecule interactions. Professor Yin and his students are developing hybrid nanoparticles that contain magnetic oxides and noble metals. The magnetic component allows the hybrid nanoparticles to be assembled into larger structures with the desired handedness under a magnetic field. The resulting handedness can be transferred to noble metal components, exhibiting substantial handedness-dependent optical responses. Their discoveries could lead to the development of more effective mechanical and chemical sensors and novel anti-counterfeiting devices. The team is also working on promoting research-based learning approaches for K-12 and undergraduate students at UCR, local schools, community colleges, and beyond.<br/><br/>Based on a theoretical understanding of the inherent chirality of gradient magnetic fields, Professor Yin and his co-workers are developing magnetic assembly strategies to create novel plasmonic chiral superstructures. Magnetic/plasmonic hybrid nanostructures are assembled in magnetic field gradients into superstructures with substantial and wavelength-controllable chiroptical responses. Hybrid nanospheres and nanorods will be used as the model building blocks to explore their interactions with  magnetic field gradients, the formation of chiral superstructures, and the field-responsive chiroptical properties of the resulting assemblies. In parallel, the team is also exploring the creation of chirality in uniform magnetic fields by taking advantage of the unique assembly behaviors of colloidal hybrid nanostructures with specially designed shape anisotropy. Systematic studies will be carried out to understand how nanoparticle shape can determine assembly behavior in uniform magnetic fields. An in-depth understanding of these two systems would allow for further exploration of  nanostructure assembly with specific shape anisotropy in magnetic field gradients.  The ultimate goal is to generate hierarchical superstructures featuring primary and secondary chirality of different length scales. By taking advantage of the field-responsive chiroptical properties of these novel chiral materials, the team is designing systems that have the potential for application as highly sensitive mechanical sensors, color-switching materials, and even anti-counterfeiting devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. coastal communities are susceptible to tropical cyclone (TC) damages, with urban infrastructure that is ill-equipped for TC-induced flooding. Recent active Atlantic hurricane seasons (i.e., 2020) have cast justified attention on the role of climate change in altering TCs in the North Atlantic. However, a robust analysis of the influence of longer-time scale climate variability on the frequency and trajectories of TC is hindered by the short observation datasets (~ 50 years available from satellite records). Past records of hurricanes (proxy records) can extend the record of TC statistics to thousands of years beyond observational data. But these records tend to capture only close-moving and intense storms which make it difficult to ascertain whether past records of hurricanes are related to climate variability or randomness (stochasticity). Therefore, this project proposes to rigorously assess uncertainties associated with past hurricane records (paleohurricanes) by analyzing existing proxies of TCs from the North Atlantic and comparing them to new TC model simulations of the past millennium. These data-model comparisons will then be used to both investigate the sensitivity of Atlantic TCs to changing climate drivers and feedbacks in a model world, and to test the ability of individual and networks of paleohurricane records in capturing TC climate in the real world. The potential Broader Impacts include a better understanding of the processes driving changes in tropical cyclones activity in the Atlantic and a potential improvement of the ability to predict future tropical cyclones risk for coastal communities<br/><br/>Specifically, the researchers will: 1) Generate North Atlantic TC datasets spanning multiple model simulations of the last millennium; 2) Investigate relationships between the past response of modeled TCs and climatic drivers (such as the North Atlantic Subtropical High and El Niño Southern Oscillation); 3) Integrate new TC simulations with existing records of past hurricanes spanning the past millennium to quantify the climate signal captured in individual records compared to local noise; and 4) Develop methodology for combining reconstructions of past hurricanes to maximize regional-to-basin-wide climate signal. This project will potentially expand the dataset of landfalling TCs to better quantify local risks and robustly assess the role for climate variability in driving TC activity. A storm dataset spanning the last 1000 years will be developed and available to the broader scientific community and stakeholders. This project will provide research experience and support for two early-career scientists, including research support for one postdoctoral fellow and undergraduate students at Rice University. The researchers will leverage undergraduate summer research projects through Rice?s anticipated 2020-2022 REU which recruits historically black college and community college students. Further, the researchers at Rice University will work with leaders of Girl Scouts San Jacinto Council to plan events focused on hurricane science and preparedness, including sessions that will engage the participants of the Girl Scout Global Leadership Conference, attended by 250 scouts and 150 troop leaders. The project will also support summer research experiences for high school students through collaboration with the Rice Design, Connect, Create (DCC). The 4-week summer program engages 35-60 minority participants in applied physics including climate, but also establishes networks and mentoring for participants across critical transitions in STEM career pathways ? from high school, to graduate school, and beyond ? known to be critical to retaining scientists in STEM fields.

The Fellow?s research will focus on understanding the genetics of trade-offs in microbes to better understand patterns of diversity in nature and constraints to adaptation. The research will therefore have consequences for understanding adaptation to changing environments, anti-microbial resistance evolution, and disease emergence. The Fellow will also develop an undergraduate research program to contribute to training the next generation of researchers in biology, including those currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This research project will explore how trade-off shapes change over time, depend on evolutionary history, and determine coevolutionary diversification. A key goal of the project will be to understand how genetic processes determine phenotypic trade-offs, and how these processes might explain observed patterns in the conditionality of trade-offs. This will be achieved by using barcoding methods in two model systems (one evolutionary yeast system and one coevolutionary Pseudomonas and phage system) to conduct high-throughput fitness assays in multiple environments (or on coevolved partners) and track lineage dynamics. The first objective will determine how trade-off shapes change over time by further evolving existing first-step yeast mutants in specialist and generalist directions and periodically reassessing the Pareto front of evolving genotypes. The second objective will evolve yeast lineages in fluctuating environments and determine how environmental heterogeneity influences the joint distribution of mutational fitness effects. The final objective will determine how trade-off determines coevolutionary dynamics by developing methods to conduct high-throughput fitness assays and lineage tracking in Pseudomonas and phage model systems. The Fellow will gain training experience with computational and genetic methods that includes high-throughput assays and building barcoded libraries.

A common goal in these situations is to obtain the limit of the sequence inexpensively. As a simple example, there are several ways to generate a sequence of numbers that converge to the number pi and some sequences will reach the limit pi rather quickly. In some cases, it may be possible to modify the original method that produced the sequence to obtain a faster converging one. However, this is not always possible or cost-effective because the process by which the sequence is produced is not explicit or it may be too cumbersome for this approach to be practical. Another common solution is to transform the sequence, by 'accelerating it'. This usually entails combining the terms of the sequence to produce new entries that reach the limit faster. So far, acceleration methods were developed by mathematicians and (quantum) physicists to deal with a wide range of problems from the physical sciences. The primary goal of this project is to study such acceleration methods and to adapt them to the modern era by focusing on topics related to machine learning and, more generally, data sciences. This collaborative research project between researchers at Emory University and the University of Minnesota, will develop and study theoretically a number of robust acceleration algorithms with an emphasis on problems that stem from data-related applications, as well as train graduate students in this field of study. <br/><br/>The need to accelerate numerical sequences of various types has frequently been felt across a wide range of disciplines and it has been addressed by many researchers for quite some time. In the past, such acceleration or extrapolation schemes were targeted mainly toward sequences of vectors that arise from physical simulations, e.g., the sequence of potentials generated by the Self Consistent Field (SCF) iterations in quantum physics. In recent years, the rapid expansion of machine learning methodologies across a great variety of disciplines has generated new demand for algorithms to accelerate sequences of various types. However, the new type of sequences encountered in these applications differ in fundamental ways from their analogues in physical simulations. In contrast with the common setting required in, e.g., quantum physics, calculations in machine learning are often performed in single or half precision instead of double precision. Furthermore, in neural networks these sequences tend to be very irregular because they originate from stochastic gradient  approaches. The collaborative team from Emory University and the University of Minnesota, will develop and study theoretically a number of robust acceleration algorithms with an emphasis on their application to irregular sequences such as those encountered in data-related applications. The investigating team will study a number of strategies for improving the robustness of standard acceleration schemes, such as Anderson mixing, or the epsilon algorithm. A number of recently advocated second-order methods, based on (so-called) momentum ideas, have been shown to be of great help in accelerating standard stochastic gradient descent methods in Deep Learning. The investigators will add to these schemes another method of the same class that is grounded in Chebyshev acceleration. One advantage of the Chebyshev-based scheme is that it is fairly easy to study theoretically in part because it is well understood for linear problems. In a second research direction, the investigating team will study acceleration methods in the specific context of machine learning tasks. For example, inspired by recent advances in parameter averaging and variance reduction schemes they will explore the application of classical extrapolation methods to stochastic gradient sequences as an adaptive extrapolation procedure. Experiments show that parameter averaging is key to the success of acceleration procedures. Just as important is the selection of the vectors to accelerate. Along the same lines, robust acceleration schemes will be designed and studied for sequences hampered by low precision arithmetic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This textile commodity chain is an ideal site to explore the emergence and expansion of niche markets, as it provides a context for observing the social, economic, and political variables influencing the transformation of a clothing industry generally associated with luxury markets.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research aims to explain the phenomenon in epidemics known as transmission dispersion, where most new infections are transmitted from relatively few infected individuals. For example, roughly 10% of COVID-19 cases cause 80% of new COVID-19 cases. This variation could be due to differences among hosts, for example, in how much infected people cough. Most research to date has focused on variability in host responses to infections. However, the pathogen itself (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 virus) can also impact transmission dispersion. For example, distinct strains of pathogens can drive different numbers of new infections. Increases in the number of new hosts that pathogens transmit to is commonly a result of adaptive evolution (e.g., new SARS-CoV-2 variants). The Fellow hypothesizes that evolution can also increase transmission dispersion when pathogens adapt to variable host populations. Specifically, pathogens could adapt to specialize on highly infectious hosts. However, this might come at the cost of transmitting less effectively from the larger but less-infectious host group. In this way, pathogen adaptation could further skew transmission events so that most new infections are transmitted from a minority of infectious hosts. The study?s results will help to predict when host variability drives the adaptation of pathogens with highly dispersed transmission; this will help to improve the accuracy of models that predict the course of epidemics. In addition, the Fellow will develop and teach educational modules on pathogen ecology and evolution to Philadelphia School System students with the aim of increasing students? sense of belonging and confidence in their abilities in science. <br/><br/>The Fellow will determine whether parasite adaptation increases transmission dispersion by (1) developing mathematical models to generate theoretical predictions and (2) testing predictions using an experimental system based on the bacterium E. coli and its viral pathogen, phage lambda. Through this training, the Fellow will gain essential skills to establish a combined theoretical and experimental research program focused on parasite evolutionary ecology and epidemiological dynamics. Further, the Fellow?s outreach skills will improve by developing and teaching educational modules on pathogen ecology and evolution to K-12 students that will increase their confidence in doing science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their catastrophic failure when undergoing thermal and mechanical stresses is a concern. In contrast, although marine spicules are also made of a brittle ceramic (silica), they show unusual toughness and flexibility due to their nested cylindrical structure. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will initially focus on investigating the microstructure, micromechanical properties, and crack development patterns and mechanisms in marine spicules found in a marine sponge, Euplectella aspergillum. The research findings will be subsequently used to design and fabricate similar structures from brittle materials such as rigid polymers and ceramics and explore their potential for bone tissue engineering and other applications. As part of the project, research will be integrated in the curriculum to train next-generation engineers. Undergraduate and graduate underrepresented minority and female students will be recruited into the research effort. There will be summer programs and workshops for K-12 students to learn about additive manufacturing. Lastly, high school teachers will be invited to summer research programs and industrial connections will be strengthened through collaborative research.  <br/> <br/>The objective of this research is to investigate the role of architecture in the facture behavior of bio-inspired nested cylindrical structures made of brittle materials. The inspiration comes from marine spicules composed of silica that resist the propagation of cracks due to the layered structure.

First, a combination of scanning electron microscopy and finite element modeling will be used to extensively examine the toughening effect of various geometrical configurations, roughness, and morphology of the surface of cylinders and materials properties of marine spicules. These findings will form the basis of various spicule-inspired structural configurations made of tough polymers and ceramics, which will be fabricated with stereolithography 3D printing processes. An extensive experimental program based on the Taguchi method and finite element analysis will be used to understand the operative deformation mechanisms.

Networks influence all domains of society, including the diffusion of information and misinformation, the contagion of illness, the passage of legislation, the emergence and maintenance of norms, and the formation of close relationships. In many cases, these networks can be difficult to analyze because they contain so many relationships, and because the strength of these relationships is unknown. Backbone extraction involves identifying and retaining only the most important relationships, which yields a simpler network that can be more readily analyzed and visualized. In this project, in addition, the widely employed backbone software is extended to include these newly developed methods so that researchers can use them easily.

Finally, the performance of each existing and each new backbone model is evaluated by extracting the backbone from simulated dense unweighted networks that have been embedded with hidden community or hub structures. Once the most promising backbone models are identified, their software implementations are refined for scalability, allowing them to be applied to large networks.

Associated to each algebraic number field, there is an invariant, the class group, that measures the complexity of the number field structure. While computation of the class group is hard in general, numerical evidence suggests that the class group is ""random"" when ranging over a reasonable family of number fields, and this randomness behavior is studied in a recently active area ? arithmetic statistics. One way to study this random invariant is to construct a random model which contains key parameters and use the model to simulate the distributions of class groups. This project will explore various questions about the constructions of such random models and their applications. The project also provides support for an undergraduate research experience.<br/> <br/>The research in this project is at the intersection of algebraic number theory, arithmetic statistics, group theory, and probability theory. The PI and her collaborators have produced a series of works on the non-abelian Cohen--Lenstra heuristics to give reasonable conjectures to predict the distributions of the Galois groups of the maximal unramified extensions of global fields (which are non-abelian generalizations of class groups). In particular, the non-abelian random group models constructed in this work play an important role in connecting the Galois objects with their arithmetic statistics. The PI plans to continue working along this direction, which includes: deeply studying the Galois structures of unramified extensions, proving properties of the Galois structure that are implied by the new arithmetical statistical heuristics, and studying how the random group models are affected by removing some restrictions in previous work. Explicitly, this project has three key goals: 1) modify the non-abelian Cohen?Lenstra heuristics in the case when the base field contains roots of unity; 2) study how the signature of the base field affects the distribution, and 3) generalize Gerth's conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now, a completely new way of observing the Universe, especially extreme phenomena such as the merger of black holes, is available to scientists that will bring revolutionary insights in astrophysics and fundamental Physics. The detection of gravitational waves is enabled by advances in instrumentation as well as the computer algorithms used to analyze the copious amounts of data produced by them. The degree to which a data analysis method can dig into the highly noisy data to reliably extract an astrophysical signal -- its sensitivity -- underlines the science that can be done with GW detectors. One of the most challenging data analysis problem at present is the implementation of the optimal method, namely, fully-coherent all-sky (FCAS) search, for analyzing data from the worldwide network of GW detectors. While statistical theory suggests that this method has the highest sensitivity, its high computational cost limits it at present to a sporadic rather than always-on mode of use. Under this project, a fast FCAS search will be implemented that will overcome this computational barrier. This will allow data from a detector network to be analyzed in its entirety with the highest achievable sensitivity. Implementing this project in a frontier area of science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), a minority serving institution, will have far-reaching broader impacts in terms of attracting students from under-represented groups to STEM. Through this project, students will acquire advanced data analysis and computing skills that are transferable across a wide variety of careers and relevant to national needs.<br/><br/>There are two main ingredients involved in the acceleration of the FCAS search: a nature-inspired optimization algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a massively parallel implementation using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). For the latter, the PI will use a GPU cluster under acquisition that is partially supported by an NSF-MRI grant. PSO is modeled on the behavior of a bird flock trying to find the best source of food. Here, it is being used to find the best-fit GW signal to the data. PSO by itself leads to a 10-fold reduction in the computational cost of an FCAS search while GPU acceleration provides an additional similar factor in speedup. A key aspect of the project will be the development of novel vetoes for rejecting instrumental non-GW signals (""glitches"") that dominate the background rate of false alarms. These vetoes are enabled by coherent network data analysis and the exploration of unphysical sectors of signal parameter space by PSO. In addition, novel data conditioning approaches will be used and tested in the search, such as an adaptive spline fit based glitch estimation and subtraction algorithm. The combination of an intrinsically more sensitive method and better vetoes could potentially uncover new signals in open GW data and confirm marginal events. This will create a more complete sample of the CBC source population that will help astrophysicists achieve a better understanding of the formation channels for the unusual binary systems that are being discovered. New sectors of signal parameter space, such as binaries with sub-solar mass components, can be efficiently explored with the accelerated code and tighter rate constraints will be set in the absence of detections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational-wave (GW) physics and astronomy has entered a new era: GW transient events (so far, from the merger of compact binary systems containing black holes and/or neutron stars) detected with the LIGO and Virgo detectors in their first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3) are frequent. In the fourth observing run (O4), estimated to begin in December 2022 and continuing for one year, the KAGRA detector will also participate, and the LIGO and Virgo detectors will have increased sensitivity to distant sources. This will result in unprecedented rates of discovery of GWs from compact binary mergers, and the potential for many discoveries of GWs from other astrophysical sources such as a stochastic GW background. Indeed, entirely new classes of GW sources may be discovered.  These observations will enable a wealth of studies, ranging from fundamental physics to astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. Observations of binary black hole mergers are used to understand stellar evolution and the formation, evolution and death of binaries. They enable uniquely powerful tests of general relativity in the strong-field, highly-dynamical regime of gravity. Observations of binary neutron star mergers enable constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unique measurements of the local Hubble-Lemaitre parameter, and insights into the origins of element formation in the universe. The proposed work, in coordination with the LIGO Laboratory and LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) Collaborations, focuses on the development of methods to confidently identify weak GW signals from astrophysical sources in the noisy data, using highly optimized search pipelines, and interpret the results in their astrophysical context. These methods will be further developed and applied to data from the LVK O4 run, and lessons learned will be incorporated into appropriate preparation for future observing runs. A variety of activities involving students and teachers from local middle and high schools, mentoring summer undergraduate research fellows, and organizing and participating in GW Open Data Workshops, aim to make these advances in gravitational wave science accessible to a broad range of people and groups.<br/><br/>This work is devoted to discovering and analyzing gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors during FY2023-FY2025 (LIGO's observing runs O4 and O5). Specific scientific goals are: (a) Identifying GW signals from compact binary mergers in data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, using two of the LSC ""flagship"" search pipelines, PyCBC and gstlal; (b) performing ever more sensitive Tests of General Relativity as the theory of strong-field gravity governing binary black hole (BBH) mergers, through searches for post-merger GW ""echoes"", searches for non-tensorial polarizations in GWs from CBCs, and searches for beyond-GR parameters in signal waveforms from BBH mergers; (c) performing ever deeper searches for strong gravitational lensing of GW signals from compact binary mergers - the identification of GW event pairs, including sub-threshold event candidates, and joint parameter estimation; (d) improving the efficiency and robustness of single-event astrophysical parameter estimation to infer the masses and spins of the compact objects with accuracy and precision; and (e) using the much larger event count from O4 and O5 to further develop our understanding of the BBH merger rate as a function of mass, spin, and cosmological redshift. The work will build on existing expertise and experience in all of these efforts, and extend them to the era of frequent detections by automating routine tasks. The results of these efforts will make it possible to make confident detections of GW events as they become frequent, and make the information obtained available to the LSC, to the astronomical community, and to the public, promptly, so that they can be fully exploited by those communities to advance gravitational-wave astronomy. In order to make gravitational wave science accessible to a broad range of people and groups, the following activities will be pursued: training and mentoring a diverse range of undergraduate students in the LIGO SURF/REU program; supporting open science through the GW Open Science Center; organizing and participating in annual GW Open Data Workshops; using scientific computing as a tool to engage high school and undergraduate students through online tutorials and through outreach to STEM teachers at local schools; and engaging in K-12 outreach and communicating with the general public, through visits to local middle- and high-school STEM fairs and classrooms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting in oxidative stress, inflammation, and pancreatic beta-cell destruction. Current antioxidant therapies are hindered by limitations of antioxidant effectiveness, including low ability to target reactive oxygen species (ROS) sites (e.g. mitochondria) and selectivity for immune cells. The proposed research develops a new class of nanostructured antioxidant vesicular biomaterials that promote our understanding of immune regulation in T1D. This vesicular platform can be adapted for enhanced functionalities, providing transformative knowledge for developing antioxidant materials for the treatment of a broad spectrum of immune-mediated disorders. The benefits to the biomaterials community are a better understanding of antioxidant material properties for immune suppression. Scientific problems that can be addressed by the knowledge obtained in this project may also include understanding the immune responses in T1D. The educational objective of the project is to expand a discovery-driven multidisciplinary biomaterials science program at UAB and to promote diversity from high school, undergraduate-, graduate-, and post-graduate levels. Students and scholars will be trained in materials and immunological aspects of biomaterials science and will participate in intensive, multidisciplinary collaborations. The collaborative efforts will expand interdisciplinary research and provide awareness of the biomedical research community at UAB toward a need for antioxidant polymer-based biomaterials. The educational and outreach activities of this project will enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) participation and STEM education, increase public awareness and engagement with science through knowledge dissemination, and increase partnerships with industry to increase economic competitiveness in the USA.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>The goal of this project is to develop a microvesicular biomaterial, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), with controlled antioxidant activity and to determine the physicochemical and antioxidant effects of these microvesicles on innate and adaptive immune responses to restore immune tolerance in T1D. The GUVs will be designed through self-assemblies of degradable amphiphilic triblock copolymers with antioxidants integrated within the vesicle interior, while antigens anchored to the vesicle outer surface will promote antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to target autoreactive T cells. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: (1) Synthesize GUVs modified with T1D autoantigens and study the microvesicle uptake by APCs. (2) Investigate the effects of antioxidant microvesicles on ROS synthesis and redox-dependent signaling pathways in APCs. (3) Determine the effects of antioxidant microvesicles on polarization of macrophage and dendritic cells and the activation of autoreactive T cells. The complementary studies outlined in our proposal will test hypotheses that effective control of redox signaling pathways and, subsequently, decreasing innate and adaptive immune responses can be achieved by rationally designing antioxidant GUVs. The specific impact of the proposed study is in: (a) developing a series of synthetic routes to new types of antioxidant polymer self-assembled vesicles; (b) bringing knowledge on the effects of GUV structure and antioxidant type on the GUV antioxidant activity;  (c)   understanding the impact of microvesicle size, rigidity, and antigen-modification on interactions with immune cells; (d) obtaining fundamental insights into the selective APC targeting with antigen  mirovesicles to regulate proinflammatory responses of innate and adaptive immune cells; and (e) understating the role of antioxidant GUVs on modulation of redox-regulated pathways involved in immune cell activation and proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine synthesis. Our results will impact the development of polymer self-assembled vesicles with a broad range of antioxidant activity and will provide a fundamental understanding of materials' physical, chemical, and immunomodulatory properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smith of Florida State University (FSU) will study more efficient ways to prepare complex biologically active natural products. The structural complexity of the target molecules still poses a significant challenge for molecular construction. This provides an opportunity for inventing and implementing novel synthetic strategies and tactics to assemble these important molecular scaffolds. To this end, we will use feedstock starting materials as cheap and malleable building blocks to quickly build some of nature?s more challenging molecular architectures. The chemistry developed under this grant will not only benefit our scientific goals, but will provide a novel technological platform for other practitioners to exploit when building important nitrogenous molecules. Additionally, the impact of chemistry will be emphasized both in the curriculum at FSU and in the broader Tallahassee area. A new course will be made available to both graduates and undergraduates that will incorporate talks from practitioners in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, laboratory demonstrations and activities for primary and secondary students will highlight the role chemistry has on everyday life (e.g. indigo in denim clothing). These research and educational endeavors aim to inspire both interest in the art of molecular construction and provide a foundational platform for the promotion of science in young students.<br/><br/>	The piperidine ring is the most prevalent heterocycle in marketed pharmaceutical ingredients and is a common substructure in many biologically active alkaloids. Joel Smith and his FSU team are interested in the controlled synthesis of a variety of complex fused piperidines from pyridines, their aromatic congeners. The controlled functionalization of pyridines is endowed with as many advantages for redox economy as much as it is fraught with challenges with imbuing precise regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes. The Smith Lab has developed a malleable dearomatization reactivity platform with which to access various alkaloids including those from the aspidosperma, tangutorine, strychnos, and manzamine families. Many of these synthetic targets have never been accessed previously. Having a unified approach to this level of molecular diversity is distinguishing feature of this  approach. Surmounting these synthetic challenges will provide for new avenues in chemical reactivity, and advance the area of pyridinium-system-based strategic approaches to architecturally novel and complex natural product scaffolds.

This project will seek a deeper understanding of these large fluctuations. It will also study similar effects in condensed matter and atomic systems which may be possible to observe in the laboratory. The results of this investigation may have broader impacts on other areas of science, mathematics, and possibly technology. The basic principles and techniques to be explored are expected to have application beyond the specific set of topics to be studied. The project will contribute to education, and to human resource development through the involvement of students. Both graduate and undergraduate students can participate in various aspects of the project, and to improve their skills in scientific analysis and communication.

This wax-made storage structure, which is essential to the survival of the colony, is constructed in a near-optimal manner that minimizes the wax-to-storage space ratio, due to the high energy cost associated with wax production. Honeybees construct the comb with remarkable precision, regardless of irregular boundaries or unevenness of the surface on which they work. Yet the mechanisms by which honeybees adapt their construction to the constraints of the environment (e.g., a pre-existing cavity in a tree) are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to shed light on the process of comb construction by framing it as a pattern formation process, which allows us to leverage the similarities between comb structure and the structure of non-living materials such as crystals and graphene. This project bridges tools from multiple disciplines, bringing insights from animal behavior and crystallography. The outcome of this research is a novel framework for modeling the collective behavior of honeybees as well as quantitatively describing the geometry and topology of the honeybee lattices. This project will not only help us understand the collective behavior of bees, but will also help leverage that understanding to create bio-inspired system designs in the fields of swarm robotics, collective construction, and lightweight cellular structures.<br/>                                               <br/>                   <br/>This research project will address three specific questions: (1) Are the irregularities in the honeycomb structure the result of global planning that accounts for distant frustration sources (e.g., solid boundaries of a tree cavity) or a local reaction to the immediate surroundings of a given cell? (2) Can the honeycomb pattern be explained as the result of an energy minimization process, and if so, are the solutions comparable to patterns consistently found in a diverse range of self-organized crystallographic systems under geometric frustration (e.g., colloidal crystals or graphene)? (3) To what extent is the optimality of the solution to the geometric problem of comb construction modulated by large-scale changes in the environment, such as engineered boundaries, various given cell sizes, or curvature? The investigators in this project will use 3D-printing to construct precisely controlled and quantified honeycomb foundations, which can be used to introduce systematic and repeatable sources of geometric frustration in the experiments. The final comb structures will be imaged and analyzed (computer vision techniques, x-ray microscopy) to precisely characterize the geometry of individual cells and the topology of the global lattice. This rich information set will be used to develop and validate data-driven agent-based models to explore possible underlying mechanisms of collective comb construction. The approach followed in this project goes beyond the traditional view of collective behavior as stigmergy -- wherein organisms respond to local cues with little or no long-range effects -- to explore the influence of long-range interactions that are physically mediated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applying a flow to the molten polymer enables the polymer to nucleate many crystals rapidly, resulting in a finer scale structure with superior mechanical properties.  With small enough crystals, each long polymer chain can span many crystals, with connections between crystals referred to as tie chains.  Stronger flows stretch polymer chains and create more tie chains for superior toughness.  This study aims to provide deep fundamental understanding regarding the control of structure and mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers by applying flows of various strengths prior to crystallization.  If successful, the fundamental knowledge generated from this research will result in the understanding needed to be able to design polymeric materials for a variety of applications.  This new knowledge will be of use to industry to tailor/improve the mechanical properties of engineering thermoplastic materials.  The project also includes extensive teaching and training of students at all levels and academic and industrial collaborations.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  <br/><br/>Brief intervals of shear flow can strongly accelerate nucleation of semicrystalline polymers, and this drastically changes the final morphology and mechanical properties.  There are two morphology transitions.  For weak shear flows, faster nucleation creates a fine micron-scale morphology, while stronger flows can create a shish-kebab morphology.  Above a critical shear rate needed to stretch the longest chains, shear thinning starts and smaller crystals are formed by accelerating nucleation.  Above a critical shear stress, a second morphology transition to shish-kebab morphology occurs.  A fundamental study of flow-induced crystallization (FIC) is proposed using three polymer types that each have strictly linear chains, to decide which aspects of FIC are universal to all semicrystalline polymers and which are polymer-specific.  We exploit a vital experimental finding regarding ?melt memory?; the interval of shear creates nucleation precursors that are very stable to thermal cycling as long as temperature is never raised above the equilibrium melting temperature.  That allows using a wide array of experimental methods to study the effects of those precursors on subsequent crystallization and morphology development.  These methods include differential scanning calorimetry, flash scanning chip calorimetry, X-ray scattering, polarized optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and mechanical properties.  This precursor stability also potentially provides a means to greatly enhance nucleation kinetics during polymer processing, as long as the temperature is not too high; this will also be explored. Since the longest chains stretch first, more long chains will be added to see whether this enables a larger FIC effect.  Since nanoparticles can also nucleate crystals, various particle loadings will be studied to understand the competition between particle nucleation and flow-enhanced nucleation.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this, Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) will create a new USA Sky Partners program where LCO provides access to their global robotic telescope network and partners with US colleges and universities that reach students from groups that are underrepresented in astronomy.  The goals of this pilot project are three-fold: (1) Fully develop partnerships between LCO, Occidental College, and the University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras that provide real astronomy research experiences for undergraduates at a Hispanic-serving university and a small liberal arts college in Los Angeles with a diverse student population. (2) Develop the online video and written materials required to implement the pilot student research program, in English and Spanish, and run the program at both university partner institutions. (3) Recruit additional institutional partners that reach underserved communities to join the partnership for a future proposal for a long-term full partnership.<br/><br/>The student research program is an eight-week workshop that can be done separately or in conjunction with an introductory astronomy course. The observing experience utilizes the ten 0.4m telescopes in the LCO network. All that is required to observe with LCO telescopes is a computer with access to the internet and an allocation of telescope time. Observations are requested from a web browser and pipeline processed data are returned via the web-based archive when the observations are complete. The observatory scheduling is automated. With ten 0.4m telescopes dedicated almost entirely to education, students have a high success rate in obtaining observations, regardless of where they are physically located. Students will select targets to study, learn how to use LCO telescopes, write a brief proposal for their target, make observations, and learn how to write a paper as part of their research process.

The requirement of establishing a strong coupling between light (quantized electromagnetic radiation) and single atoms (quantum emitters) is ubiquitous in the fundamental studies of light-matter interaction at the smallest scale. Typically, this interaction is simplified to a scenario of single-mode fields trapped inside optical cavities and coupled with a single atom. However, the recent advancements in quantum computing and quantum networking are requiring the coherent control of 100-1000 quantum bits (qubits) with the possibility of reliable quantum communication over 100s kilometers. In this context, multiple-emitter waveguide quantum electrodynamics (one-dimensional waveguides/fibers strongly coupled with a chain of atoms) has emerged as a fascinating platform due to its ability to host several useful quantum effects (such as quantum correlations e.g., entanglement, atom-photon bound state formation, one-way light-matter interaction or chirality, controlled photon transport, and collective photon emission, etc.) in a single setup. This project aims to study one-way or chiral waveguide quantum electrodynamics architectures as a testbed to investigate many-body quantum optical effects under the influence of environmental interactions. The completion of this project will result in the development of more powerful theoretical and numerical tools that will go beyond the typical single-atom single-mode field interaction paradigm of quantum optics and will be suitable for the examination of the state-of-the-art and futuristic quantum technological devices. The project includes the development of a two-year program of integrating research and education in quantum optics and quantum information science (QIS) in the Physics Department at Miami University. With the growing interest and investment in the National Quantum Initiative, there is a demand for training the next generation of workforce in QIS. This award will offer such training opportunities by engaging historically underrepresented students through direct outreach at the high school and undergraduate levels. To further extend the outreach program, the PI will develop online and face-to-face modules accessible to high school students through the Miami University Summer Scholar Program and undergrad students through the Miami University eLearning department.<br/> <br/>In particular, the proposed research here aims to: (1) perform an in-depth theoretical study of the quantum transport properties of few (one, two, or three)-photon Fock states in chiral waveguides that are simultaneously coupled with several noisy quantum emitters, and to (2) analyze the generation and control of several types of quantum effects such as entanglement between emitters, collective emitter effects (superradiance, subradiance, selective radiance), and emitter-cavity bound states, etc.  Open quantum system approaches (Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, real-space quantization technique, and quantum jump approach) will be utilized to quantify the photon transport in terms of reflection and transmission spectra, second-order correlation functions as well as to predict the time evolution of emitter- waveguide systems. At every stage of the project, the connection of the results obtained with the experimentally feasible applications in quantum information transfer, storage, and processing protocols will also be emphasized. Additionally, while accomplishing the goals of the project, the PI will train a group of two graduate and six undergraduate students in quantum information science at Miami University. The PI will also introduce concepts of quantum computation in various undergraduate-level physics courses and will offer quantum computing modules for underrepresented groups of high school students through the Miami University Summer Scholar Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A cultural trait known as collective disaster memory emerges when such information is widely shared among contemporaries or passed down to subsequent generations through conversations, historical texts, or built environment features. Although collective memory has a potential to significantly shape people?s vulnerability/ defense to future similar events through changes in their preparations and ways of thinking, there is a lack of empirical understanding of under what set of conditions disaster memories can be collectively forgotten or sustained over multiple generations. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to study this puzzle in the context of flood hazards, flood memory, and the built environment for flood protection. Multiple methods, comprised of surveys and case studies based in distinct risk settings (Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas) and human-subject behavioral experiments, will be used to test hypotheses related to explaining variation in the durability of collective disaster memory. Based on the empirical data, system-level models will be developed to computationally test how different forms of memory transmission and people?s adaptations affect the dynamics of collective memory and regional vulnerability in different environmental and social settings. The project will also contribute to education in two ways: developing a new method and tools for evaluation of students? learning about social and collective memory implications of civil engineering; and offering education and training opportunities for the next-generation workforce in disaster science and resilience studies through mentored research experiences and new course modules. <br/><br/>This project will address two key questions: 1) how different configurations of memory transmission forms and physical and social contextual factors will lead to differences in the durability of collective flood memory and 2) how the state of such memory, in turn, affects people?s collective action to deal with future flood events. This will be achieved through a multi-method approach comprised of behavioral experiments, surveys and case data collection, and systems modeling. The research will begin with case studies of two distinct areas (Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas) to generate case specific insights, identifying the details of each area?s historical flood events and their memories. A survey will be conducted in each case area with the representative random sample of the general public to assess the current collective memory states of the historical floods and how people learned about them. This will be followed by controlled behavioral experiments with different populations to test effects of different forms of memory or cultural transmission on the durability of collective memory and group ability to solve a collective-risk social dilemma framed as a public levee maintenance problem. The resulting empirical findings will be compared and triangulated for the generality and transferability of the results. Finally, generic system-level models of collective memory dynamics in a prototypical human-flood system will be developed and tested for synthesis and generalizable understanding. This project is expected to lead to new knowledge, tools, and research trajectory for disaster science and resilience studies that consider the effects of collective disaster memory and its interplay with built and social environmental features. The project?s significance lies in its rigorous experimental and modeling work that seeks to disentangle and test unresolved hypotheses related to the relationship among the durability of disaster memory, different forms of cultural transmission, infrastructure and hazard attributes, and underlying social structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Euclidean geometry has applications to computer science and crystallography, as well as various branches of modern mathematics. The other two geometries are Spherical and Hyperbolic. Spherical geometry is central to the study of geophysics and astronomy, and vital for navigation. Hyperbolic geometry has modern applications to the theory of special relativity in Physics. Global Riemannian Geometry generalizes these three geometries. One of the major challenges in this area of study is to understand how local geometric invariants such as curvature, that is, how the space under consideration ""bends"",  relate to global topological invariants such as fundamental group, which indicates whether or not the space has 1-dimensional ""holes"". Manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied intensively since the conception of global Riemannian geometry. One relatively recent approach to the study of manifolds with lower curvature bounds has been the introduction of symmetries and is the main focus of this project. The project will also continue the PI's outreach work with middle and high school students, as well as graduate training, and the organization of workshops and conferences with an emphasis on the inclusion of women and under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The project will pursue a program in which she carefully studies and analyzes symmetries of  Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds, considering sectional, Ricci, scalar, and intermediate scalar curvature lower bounds and some of their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with an eye to gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of spaces. The project will study not only how continuous and discrete symmetries relate to the topology of such spaces, but also aim to find new examples of Riemannian manifolds of positive Ricci curvature and almost non-negative sectional curvature using symmetries and topology as tools to do so.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project aims at understanding how microbes growing in desert soils can use chemical interactions to obtain vital nutrients and withstand the extreme stress of desert ecosystems. Microorganisms living in desert soils include bacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens. Most research attention has focused on photosynthetic bacteria and algae, as well as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These microbes provide a source of nutrients such as carbon sugar and ammonia nitrogen, respectively, to the entire community. However, the role of fungal species in these communities is still unknown. This work aims to increase understanding of desert microbial communities by determining the role of these fungal species, which is believed to include providing melanin for increased ultraviolet and stress resistance for the whole community. This research will help provide new knowledge that will make it possible to use these microbial communities to perform soil metal removal, increase agricultural soil nutrients, retain soil moisture in droughts, and prevent desertification of non-desert ecosystems.<br/><br/>Biological soil crusts (or soil crusts) are microbial communities that form biofilms on the surface of nutrient-deplete desert soils. It is hypothesized that the microbes residing in the soil crust engage in transient interactions akin to that of a lichen symbiosis, to obtain nutrients and survive extreme abiotic stress. To investigate this hypothesis, novel microbial species isolated from a soil crust will be used to: 1) show that non-lichenized melanized fungi can establish mutualistic interactions with bacteria and algae; 2) observe how fungal melanin affects microbes from the soil crust, to determine if melanin can be considered a ?public good? for abiotic resistances and used as a carbon source; and 3) identify metabolites produced and gene regulation differences during multi-species cultures to determine how these microbes interact. The fellow has additional goals to improve both representation and experience in undergraduate research by 1) recruiting undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups and 2) developing a monthly basic lab techniques workshop to provide free lab experience to all undergraduates. Additional use of funds from this fellowship will be put towards increasing collaborations with fellow researchers in this field by developing a virtual conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major advantage of gMOFs is that they can be made in bulk, in diverse shapes, for a variety of applications. This award will promote the progress of science by focusing on the experimental understanding of the compression and shear behaviors of these absorbent materials, which is crucial for their use in industrial CO2 capture, separation, and storage applications.

The work will develop an understanding of a class of problems involving more than just two particles where current theory is extremely limited.  Specifically, the group will extract new insights into the interaction of three or four or even a few more particles, which might be atoms or molecules or nucleons or even quarks.  Those apparently dramatically different systems often show a universality, meaning that some aspects of one system are very similar and are even mirrored in other systems. This research advances one of the most promising theoretical methods for attacking this difficult class, which is based on the introduction of unusual collective coordinates that describe the motions of the system. Once the best coordinates have been selected, the project can implement the quantum mechanical equations on modern computers, and extract accurate numerical solutions. The project should yield credible predictions of new phenomena, and also qualitative insights that can suggest new paths that further advance this field of research.  The effort also strengthens the pool of talent capable of tackling the most challenging theoretical questions in the microscopic world.<br/><br/>The research planned for this proposal builds on progress in understanding currently interesting problems in universal few-body physics, stressing applications relevant to ultracold quantum systems. This active theoretical and experimental field has seen highly unusual bound and resonant states, as in the so-called Efimov effect, and it has also led to the development of theoretical methods, such as the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, which are capable of quantitatively describing inelastic collision and loss phenomena for collisions involving two to four atoms or molecules. The project will address the full parameter space of complexity of such ultracold few-body systems, both with and without an external electromagnetic field that can dress the system and modify its properties. The efforts will work to overcome the technical challenges associated with treating more than four atoms, pushing aggressively to treat five atoms in particular.  Note that ultracold quantum gas physics links quantal phenomena across multiple subfields, notably atomic, molecular, optical, condensed matter, nuclear physics, and chemical physics.

One of the defining characteristics of a turbulent fluid is its chaotic, seemingly unpredictable behavior. A widely recognized way to describe this chaotic behavior is by showing extreme exponential sensitivity with respect to initial conditions, commonly referred to as the ""butterfly effect,"" whereby tiny changes in the state of the fluid lead to very big changes after a short amount of time. Despite its fundamental nature, there are very few mathematical tools available for rigorously verifying exponential sensitivity in a given system, particularly in turbulent systems. This project aims to develop mathematical tools to prove this sensitivity for various models in fluid mechanics in the presence of a small amount of noise. Such noise is commonly used to model the effect of unpredictable environmental effects or small-scale fluctuations of particles. The goal of this project is to gain new insights into the unstable nature of fluid motion in the presence of such noise and how this instability manifests as chaotic and turbulent motion observed in nature. The project will provide opportunities to involve undergraduate and graduate students and the results of the research will be widely disseminated.<br/><br/>A rigorous analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents and the numerous unstable phenomena in deterministic fluid models is a daunting task and mostly appears to be out of reach of current mathematical analysis. Recently there has been significant progress in proving instability for stochastic systems related to fluid mechanics, including Galerkin truncations of the 2d stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the Lagrangian flow associated with stochastic fluid models. This project focuses on several primary related directions: i) a study of instability and positivity of the Lyapunov exponent in Galerkin truncations for the stochastic complex Ginzburg-Landau equations ii) a study of cascading instabilities and bifurcations in the stationary measures for stochastically shear mode forced 2d Galerkin Navier-Stokes iii) a study of the emergence of the Batchelor scale in the advection diffusion equation with random mixing velocities. Each of these investigations requires developing tools from smooth ergodic theory of random dynamical systems to answer questions about instability. Several involve challenging hypoellipticity questions that can be studied using recently developed techniques from computational algebraic geometry. For instance, both the projects i) and ii) involve studying very challenging degeneracies in the hypoelliptic structure unique to the equations and require novel ideas and techniques to overcome these challenges. Project iii) on the other hand aims to give some insight into the limitations of small-scale formation in advection diffusion by smooth ergodic fluid motion. Overall, these projects aim to bring new perspectives and new techniques into the study of fluid instability and mixing in the presence of noise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project partners the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) with the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), an international scientific collaboration comprising several dozen institutions. The goals are (i) to increase the U.S. workforce diversity by promoting research and education of Hispanic/Latino undergraduate students in physics, and (ii) to advance several key NANOGrav science goals.  The activities are tailored to retain physics students, to train them in forefront physics research, and to motivate them to enter graduate school by way of a series of educational and closely supervised research projects. NANOGrav uses a galaxy-sized detector of pulsars that emit radio pulses with atomic-clock precision. The arrival times of those pulses are recorded with world-leading radio telescopes across the U.S. and Canada. NANOGrav searches for correlated changes in the arrival times, induced by ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves, that are expected to be emitted by extremely massive black holes at the cores of merging galaxies. UPRM students will be trained in a variety of data quality and analysis methods, as well as simulation techniques and astrophysical interpretation by several NANOGrav senior scientists. Besides nurturing the talent and fostering the participation of minorities, NANOGrav will directly benefit from the research by expanding and characterizing the array of pulsars. It is this so-called pulsar timing array that will detect gravitational waves and characterize their sources and hence contribute to our understanding of the history of the Universe and our place in it. A holistic approach is implemented, where the students will be immersed in remote educational programs, present NANOGrav's research activities at local high schools, participate in workshops organized locally and on the U.S. mainland, take part in research projects, and spend several weeks at a NANOGrav institution contributing to daily ongoing research activities.<br/><br/>This award partners the Physics Department at the Mayagüez campus of the University of Puerto Rico (UPRM) with the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center to advance several key NANOGrav science goals and to increase the participation and retention of minorities in the field of physics. NANOGrav?s mission is to detect and characterize low-frequency gravitational waves from merging supermassive black hole binaries using a pulsar timing array as a galactic-scale detector. Low-frequency gravitational-wave detection and characterization will provide information on galaxy merger rates, supermassive black hole masses, and processes leading to black hole coalescence. Characterization of individual pulsars of the array in turn yields information on, e.g., neutron star masses, equations of state, populations, and astrometric data; tests of general relativity; interstellar electron distributions; solar wind properties; and pulsar emission mechanisms. Undergraduate students from UPRM will be involved in research projects of relevance to NANOGrav's mission, mentored at UPRM as well as remotely and onsite at several NANOGrav institutions. The research will involve searching for new pulsars, data quality checks, pulsar simulation development, and characterizing pulsar emission properties. The students will  participate in workshops at UPRM, the Arecibo Observatory, and other NANOGrav sites, as well as to attend general NANOGrav and training meetings on the mainland. The planned research activities are focused on growing and characterizing the pulsar timing array. The sensitivity of the array is proportional to the number of pulsars and hence finding new pulsars is of fundamental importance. It has also been observed that some pulsars change emission properties, which limits their timing resolution and usefulness in the array and therefore an investigation of pulsar emission and accompanying interstellar medium effects will provide a valuable contribution to NANOGrav science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Interactions between plants and animals are ecologically important, and plants have traits that evolved to affect these interactions. Understanding how and why these traits have evolved remain some of the most important biological questions. The fellow aims to take a step closer to answering these questions by exploring the early evolution of plant nectar glands. Nectar glands (nectaries), are common in flowers, but also occur in certain non-flowering plants, like the ancient fern lineage. In ferns these nectaries attract ants that feed on the nectar and fight off insects that want to eat the plant. Yet, we do not know when these nectaries evolved in ferns or whether the underlying genes responsible for their development are similar to those in flowers. The fellow?s work is important in that it will reveal the early evolution of nectaries, potentially shifting our understanding of the evolution of these structures and early plant-animal interactions. <br/><br/>Broadly, the fellow aims to explore the origins and evolution of nectaries in a three-part multidisciplinary research program. First, integrating data on the timing of nectary evolution in ferns and flowering plants with major radiations of insect lineages, he will determine when, why, and how nectaries first evolved. Then, by using RNA-sequencing across divergent fern species he will uncover the genes underlying nectary development in ferns. He will then use comparative transcriptomics to determine if genes expressed in fern nectaries are similar to those of nectaries in flowering plants. Finally, using comparative genomics across land plants, he will pinpoint when this genetic toolkit first evolved. The fellow hypothesizes that nectaries evolved first in ferns before flowering plants, and that nectary genes in ferns are likely stomatal or phloem-specific genes which evolved early in the evolution of land plants. In addition to his research, the fellow is also committed to outreach and science communication. He plans to continue his work of democratizing the study of plant biology through his social media platform Let?s Botanize.  He is also dedicated to creating a more equitable and inclusive field of science by mentoring undergraduate students from historically marginalized groups during the Cornell University Summer Research Internship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is based on the discovery by Weisman and co-workers of a reaction that bonds DNA to nanotubes to form stable hybrid structures that have controllable optical and electronic properties. The investigators will use experiments and computations to further explore the nature of these nanotube-DNA hybrids and to examine their potential for use in biomedical sensing and quantum information processing. Apart from these research goals, the project will advance science education at several levels. Graduate students working on the project will gain essential hands-on training and will develop skills in oral and written technical communication. Undergraduate students participating in the studies will get valuable research experience. The Weisman lab will also host high school teachers during the summers in an ongoing program that expands their knowledge and leads to enriched science curricula affecting hundreds of high school students. <br/><br/>This project will deepen our understanding of the unique covalent reaction between guanine nucleobases and carbon nanotubes induced by singlet O2. This reaction perturbs the nanotube electronic structure by introducing a dense array of shallow excitonic traps whose spacing and depth can be controlled by the choice of ssDNA oligo structure. It thus has the potential to produce nanotube hybrids with engineered band gaps. Experiments supported by molecular dynamics and quantum chemical computations will investigate 1) how interactions between sensitizer and nanotube affect the covalent reaction; 2) the chemical bonding between DNA and nanotube; 3) the source of spectral broadening in the hybrids; 4) the parameters controlling functionalization extent.

Notable successes are the classification problems of identifying pictures and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Go-player that beats the best human player in the world. While these successes are important milestones, there are emerging needs to replicate these successes in the statistical modeling of time-evolving complex systems, with examples ranging from predicting climate to nanomaterials under external disturbances. The goal of this project is to develop the next-generation mathematical and algorithmic tools to overcome two important issues in extending machine learning to such problems, namely a shortage of informative data for effective learning and the expensive computational costs. This objective will be addressed by a theoretical and algorithmic development in computational mathematics, leveraging the fundamental knowledge from the basic sciences, including geometry, dynamical systems, data sciences, and statistics. This project will contribute to the NSF mission of advancing STEM through the training of graduate students and curricular development through the design of courses in the mathematical theory of machine learning. In particular, this project will support one graduate student.<br/> <br/>The goals of this project are to overcome the shortage of training data and exploit the manifold assumption to avoid the curse of dimension in the statistical modeling of dynamical systems. Beyond uncertainty quantification (UQ) applications, a statistical closure model will be developed to enhance the training of ML-based prediction models when the observed time series is too short for accurate estimation. Specifically, the proposed projects are: 1) To develop a systematic reduced-order statistical closure model. This project extends the recently developed ML-based non-Markovian closure framework for accurate predictions of statistical responses subjected to unseen external forcings, which is important for UQ. 2) To develop a dimensionality reduction technique that respects the geometry of the data under a manifold assumption on the dynamical variables. The approach includes an accurate Radial Basis Function approximation to the Bochner Laplacian from the embedded data. Subsequently, the estimated eigen-vector-fields will be used as a frame to represent the vector fields corresponding to the unresolved dynamics. This model reduction framework provides a computationally cheaper alternative to deep learning. 3) To study the theoretical convergence property of a recently developed algorithm, Bayesian Machine Learning (BML), which uses solutions of a statistically consistent model to enhance the training of the neural network (NN) model in learning non-Markovian dynamics with a short observational time series. This study is motivated by a recent empirical finding that the NN model obtained from the BML training algorithm improves the accuracy of the El Niño prediction by at least two months compared to the same NN architecture trained using the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The ultimate goal of this study is to evaluate and develop a theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of the statistical closure model from Task 1) to enhance Bayesian Machine Learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has shown that mistrust in mainstream medicine is increasing among communities who tend to be socially, economically, and politically powerful, and that these beliefs are associated in certain contexts with public health events, such as outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. An improved understanding of how social factors can render resistance to medical authority attractive can uncover ways to better understand, predict, and address mistrust in medicine and science more broadly. This project provides a scalable set of methodological and theoretical innovations aimed at understanding resistance to mainstream medicine that will provide frameworks to help researchers better understand medical mistrust in other communities. In addition to training a doctoral student in qualitative and quantitative data collection methods and anthropological theory, the results of this research will be disseminated broadly to scholarly, medical, and lay communities. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project focuses on medical decision-making during pregnancy, birth, infancy, and early childhood (when questions of routine vaccinations must be addressed), among a community that has not been historically mistreated by biomedical research, but where medical mistrust has been observed in prior research. It will investigate potential overlap between preferring non-mainstream care during birth and being mistrustful of mainstream medicine more generally. Investigators use ethnographic, pile sorts, and survey methodologies to examine whether and how medical decisions that reject the authority of mainstream medicine might be shaped by shared, subjective, and local ontologies, whether there are social and epistemological characteristics that distinguish mistrustful communities from others, and what characteristics might make medical interventions in pregnancy and early childhood more, or less, acceptable. Findings from this project will improve anthropological understandings about resistance to medical authority, how people make medical decisions, and how groups perceive and engage (or not) with mainstream medicine and other powerful social institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most cells grow, remodel and divide using the cytoskeleton ? a network of protein that function as a kind of scaffolding that gives shape and structure to the cell interior. A critical aspect of the cytoskeleton are small protein subunits called microtubules. Despite decades of study, many aspects of microtubule function and behavior are poorly understood. The Fellow will combine wet lab experiments with computational simulations to determine how new microtubules form, and how existing microtubules shrink (two behaviors critical for microtubule function). This award also supports the development of a local scientific outreach program.<br/><br/>Microtubule shrinking and spontaneous assembly (?nucleation?) rates ultimately derive from the structural and biochemical properties of ??-tubulin subunits. It remains challenging to determine how interactions between subunits less than 10 nm long determine microtubule assembly dynamics on the ?m scale. This uncertainty limits mechanistic understanding of how microtubule behavior can change between cells in the same organism, between different species, and even across taxa. To investigate how microtubules shrink, the Fellow will use pioneering measurements of mixed mutant-wild type microtubules complemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. This hybrid computational-experimental approach will test hypotheses about mechanisms of microtubule dynamics in ways that were not previously possible. To understand how new microtubules form spontaneously, or ?nucleate?, the Fellow will create new codes to simulate microtubule nucleation from unpolymerized ??-tubulin.  With these simulations, the Fellow will define the sequence of tubulin oligomers that leads to a new microtubule, and how the sequence depends on biochemical properties of ??-tubulin. Training objectives include learning new skills in advanced microscopy, computational simulations and protein work.

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. Black women are a significantly under-represented group in STEM, and one important way to remedy this is to provide training and research opportunities to Black women early in their academic careers. The research projects proposed here are carried out by undergraduates at Spelman College: Black women who are working to establish themselves in STEM. In addition to providing them with valuable scientific training in the fields of computational science, inorganic chemistry, and polymer chemistry, this research provides them with networking and professional development opportunities as well. This research is focused on using computational chemistry to model and better understand the behavior of certain metal-containing polymers. The results of the research itself can also have significantly beneficial impacts on human society by leading to the design of improved catalysts and new multifunctional materials. <br/><br/>One of the overarching goals of polymer science is to develop materials that have the functions and capabilities of proteins but are not limited by their fragility or complex synthesis. A class of materials that can potentially fulfill these criteria are single-chain nanoparticle (SCNP) metallopolymers. It has been found that metal containing SCNPs can act as effective catalysts for numerous reactions, suggesting that they could be potential ?artificial enzymes?. Using modern computational chemistry techniques (chiefly density functional theory and QM/MM simulations) the mechanisms of several catalytically active SCNP metallopolymers are being computed to help elucidate the atomistic details of their reaction pathways and how these are influenced by their polymeric features. Spin-state is also known to be an important feature in metalloenzyme reactivity and could also affect the mechanistic and catalytic behavior of SCNP enzyme mimics as well.  Therefore, systematic modeling of SCNP model systems is being performed to determine the underlying principles that govern spin-state energetics in SCNP metallopolymers. The goal of this work is to develop molecular design strategies for rationally incorporating spin-crossover (SCO) behavior into SCNPs.  By establishing a roadmap for combining the inherently quantum mechanical state-switching properties of SCO with the dynamic and modular behavior of SCNP systems, novel, soft, multifunctional materials with protein-like characteristics can be developed in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is an essential process in cancer invasion, tissue development, and wound healing. It is known that the motion results from cell-generated forces.  However, how the forces balance to create motion is not clear.  This gap in knowledge hinders efforts to control the migration, for example in cancer invasion or wound healing. It is currently believed that a friction force balances the forces produced by each cell. However, there is no established way to measure the friction force.  This makes the precise relationship between cell-generated forces and collective motion  unknown. This project will measure friction and determine what biophysical factors increase or decrease friction. This research will also study how friction affects the distance over which cell-generated forces are transmitted across a group of cells migrating together.  These findings will offer a new way to predict how cell forces bring about the collective migration.  This will be the first step to controlling the migration for applications in improving human health. This work will support interdisciplinary training of both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also partner with a Research Experience for Teachers program that will enable a high school teacher to develop hands-on activities that apply topics of this research in the classroom, which will give countless high school students an opportunity to learn about new applications of physics and biology.<br/><br/>This research will advance the field by designing experimental methods to measure friction and identifying the biophysical factors controlling friction. To this end, friction will be quantified both at the cell-substrate and cell-cell interfaces through a combination of well-controlled experiments and rigorous measurement of cell tractions, stresses, and velocities. The underlying causes of friction at the cell-substrate and cell-cell interfaces will be systematically studied by perturbing substrate stiffness, cell-substrate adhesions, cell-cell adhesions, and actomyosin contractility. Additionally, theoretical modeling predicts that the ratio of friction at the cell-cell and cell-substrate interfaces sets a length scale controlling the size of a collectively moving group of cells. The research will quantify this length scale in response to various perturbations, hence giving insight into a physics-based mechanism whereby each cell, by altering friction, can affect the collective motion on a length scale larger than itself--the scale of the collective group. Identifying mechanisms such as this one that bridge length scales is essential for understanding complicated, multi-body systems such as collective cell migration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These atomic defects can emit photons?the elementary particles of light?one at a time, creating a source of single photons; however, they typically exist randomly within the solid, lacking the synthetic control required for achieving control over atomic structure, placement on the surface and color tuning.  Controlled placement of organic color-centers on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes would enable the nanotubes to emit single, short wave infrared photons at room temperature.  Success in accomplishing the objective of the project would enable the creation and tuning of identical organic colo- centers emitting single wavelengths for emerging applications in bio-imaging, molecular sensing, and quantum information science.  In addition to the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from under-represented groups, in cutting-edge research, the project will also involve developing engaging nanoscience and technology demonstrations based on project results and sharing these with others in community outreach events.  <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Wang and his team will synthesize model defect color-centers by covalently attaching small functional groups to semi-conducting carbon nanotube hosts using organic chemistry. When the nanotube is excited, the resulting excitons?or electron-hole pairs?are harvested by the organic color-center to produce bright shortwave-infrared single photons whose ?color? sensitively depends on the atomic configuration of the defect site. The team will use this optical fingerprint to study how these organic color-centers can be generated, erased, or corrected on the carbon lattice of the nanotube semiconductor using light. This work, if successful, will pave the way to attaining  atomic control and deterministic placement of these defect color-centers.

Specific long-standing challenges to be addressed are robustness to contact terrain uncertainty, locomotion task generalization, navigation safety coupled with complex locomotion dynamics, and proactive interaction with pedestrians to avoid collisions. This project will move legged robotic systems from the research laboratory, and into challenging application domains such as disaster first responders, surveillance in civil and mechanical infrastructures, and planting in agricultural environments. The research is complemented by education activities to (i) integrate undergraduate students into a new experiment-focused research program through the multi-semester Vertically Integrated Program (VIP) at Georgia Institute of Technology; (ii) host high school students from Atlanta minority-serving public schools to perform research and enhance underrepresented population participation in the greater Atlanta area; and (iii) broaden the societal impact by disseminating the integrated robotics research through an interactive workshop.<br/> <br/>This project will develop a novel task and motion planning framework for bipedal locomotion interacting with complex environments.

Many of these advances use ultrashort light pulses or electron beams to control and observe energy and momentum properties of atomic electrons on their natural attosecond timescale (a billionth of a billionth of a second).  Recently, so-called twisted attosecond laser pulses and electron beams have become available. These beams carry orbital angular momentum, which opens the door to controlling not just the energy and momentum properties of atomic electrons, but also their rotational properties.  This research will develop and apply theoretical models for using ultrashort twisted laser pulses and twisted electron beams to image and control the rotational properties of atomic electrons.  It will promote the progress of attosecond physics by developing new techniques for studying twisted electron creation, characterizing the temporal dynamics of previously inaccessible atomic states, and establishing the efficiency of the creation of atomic states used quantum computing applications.  These projects will provide the theoretical underpinning for future experiments and technological developments, demonstrate the advantages of twisted light and electrons in controlling atomic-level rotational motion, and enhance the U.S. influence in attosecond physics.  In addition, the research will train the next generation of the science and technology workforce by providing cutting-edge research opportunities to undergraduate students who will gain necessary career skills through hands-on participation in model development, implementation, and analysis.  Students will present their results at regional and national conferences, giving them a more diverse view of scientific research and enhancing their access to science and technology careers.<br/><br/>This research will use computational modeling to (1) develop the new techniques of twisted attosecond energy and angular streaking using Laguerre-Gauss optical vortex pulses and (2) determine if twisted optical and electron wave packets can improve the efficiency of circular Rydberg atom production for use in quantum computing applications.  In the first project, the research will combine optical vortex wave packets with attosecond streaking techniques to study the effects of angular momentum on the creation of twisted photoelectrons, the ionization time delay between magnetic sublevels, and the tunneling barriers of different angular momentum states.  Calculations will be performed using the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and semi-classical models to provide both quantitative and qualitative insight.  This research will result in theoretical models that outline new twisted attosecond streaking techniques and will have far-reaching implications for fundamental quantum mechanics and applications in fields such as chemical reaction control and charge migration in solid state physics.  In the second project, the efficiency with which twisted photons and electrons can be used to create circular Rydberg states will be determined.  The research will result in a comprehensive dataset detailing which Rydberg states are most accessible through twisted wave packet excitation and provide much-needed information for future applications that have the potential to transform fields such as quantum computing and quantum simulation.

Genetic information is protected and faithfully decoded by a wide range of genome-modifying enzymes, many of which remain to be discovered. It is, thus, of fundamental importance to characterize such enzymes from eukaryotic organisms. This project will take an interdisciplinary approach, combining organic chemistry, mechanistic biochemistry, cell biology, proteomics and bioinformatics with the aim of uncovering novel genome-modifying enzymes. The proposed activity will integrate high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including those from under-represented groups, into the research to provide appropriate training experience for a career in scientific research and development and/or pedagogy. The educational plan is geared toward establishing a mentoring platform for doctoral students to overcome initial challenges and reach important milestones along the doctoral research and development pathway.  The PI puts forth a plan to improve retention of PhD students in the field of chemistry.<br/><br/>Changes in gene expression that underlie the development of eukaryotic organisms are primarily mediated by chemical modifications on the genetic material. The focus of this project is to study a particular type of nucleobase modification; namely cytidine methylation. The current repertoire of enzymes that establish, recognize and remove cytidine modifications in DNA is far from exhaustive, due in part to the lack of appropriate pharmacological probes. This research will focus on developing first-in-class oligonucleotide-based activity probes carrying electrophilic functionalities, which are to be employed to capture DNA-modifying factors via complementary reactivity from embryonic stem cells. Subsequently, chemoproteomic and bioinformatic analyses, and biochemical validation will be conducted to identify novel enzymes and signaling pathways that underlie cellular differentiation, lineage commitment, and ultimately, organismal development.

Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations is widely recognized as the prime computational methodology with the highest fidelity in capturing the intricacies of turbulent transport. However, the wide range of flow's time and length scales makes DNS prohibitively expensive and time consuming even on the most advanced high-performance supercomputers. Large eddy simulation (LES), which filters out the very small-scale transport, provides an alternative with a much lower computational cost. However, the data generated by LES are of lower accuracy due to the associated filtering, and it is desirable to reconstruct the original true DNS results from the filtered LES data. This proposal describes a novel physics-guided machine learning methodology to perform this reconstruction with a systematic assessment for a variety of turbulent flows.  <br/><br/>This project aims to advance the restoration of high-fidelity turbulent flows via three innovations. First, a new physics-guided deep learning model will be developed to reconstruct fine-resolution turbulent flow data from low-resolution coarse LES data. Additional physical learning objectives and relationships will be incorporated to ensure that the proposed model meets specific physical constraints associated with the flow, and it is also generalizable for large scale simulations. Second, a novel deep learning scheme will be developed and utilized to construct high fidelity super-resolution fields from the most reliable LES that can be currently conducted. Finally, a wide variety of turbulent flows will be considered, ranging from passive incompressible, to chemically reactive compressible for comprehensive model assessments. This project has the potential to improve our capability to efficiently simulate high-resolution turbulent flows in many scientific and engineering domains.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Understanding mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt to new environments is a key question in evolutionary biology. While genetic mechanisms have traditionally been viewed as a primary mechanism of adaptation, increasing evidence suggests behavioral changes may also be important.  Genetic mechanisms of adaptation tend to be clearer (e.g., new mutations); however, we still lack a strong understanding of mechanisms allowing shifts in behavior to facilitate evolutionary processes. Ultimately, this project will reveal mechanisms connecting short-term behavioral changes to long-term evolutionary processes and produce new predictions about when and how behavior may drive adaptation. In addition to these research goals, the project also aims to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of evolutionary biology by providing learners with access to mastery experiences such as performing scientific research with museum specimens and using the scientific method for problem-solving. <br/><br/>Plasticity?s impact on evolutionary processes is still highly debated in evolutionary biology which lacks a strong understanding of mechanisms connecting short-term plastic changes to long-term evolutionary change. The Behavior First Hypothesis predicts that mechanisms responsible for producing plastic behavioral responses should be similar to those producing behavioral diversity on an evolutionary scale. This project aims to test this prediction by investigating molecular and neural mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity in the pupfish system. The pupfish system contains a novel fish scale-eating specialist?an excellent organism for investigating how behavioral flexibility can lead to diversification?along with several non-specialist species. This research will quantify neural activity, integration, and gene expression in the brains of specialist and non-specialist pupfishes with the end goal of providing fundamental insights not only into behavior?s role in evolutionary processes, but also into how the nervous system responds to novelty, mechanisms of plasticity, and adaptation to new ecological niches. The Fellow will benefit from training in neuroscience and transcriptomics while conducting studies at the host institution.

Market integration is a process that involves a transition from subsistence-oriented lifestyles to ones based more heavily on market-oriented consumption and production. This project investigates the effects of market integration on social structure, specifically focusing on variation in the density of kin in social support networks. The project trains an anthropological graduate student in empirical, scientific data collection and analysis in cultural anthropology. Additionally, the project promotes public understanding of the science of human sociality by broad sharing of findings through publications, collaborative galleries, and lectures in academic and non-academic venues.<br/><br/>The core hypothesis tested in this research is that kinship ties in personal networks erode under increasing levels of market integration. The research uses a hybrid theoretical framework, inspired by evolutionary cultural anthropology, and mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how market-integration-related activities affect social support networks among kin and non-kin in a society that is transitioning from an agricultural base to one more strongly rooted in regional markets. The research includes a year-long ethnographic study involving social network interviews, community mapping, semi-structured interviews, socio-demographic questionnaires, and anthropometric assessments to obtain data that links economic, social, and health variables in contexts with varying degrees of market engagement. These systematically collected data will enrich the understanding of when, how, and why kinship relationships may break down and what consequences this has on social relationships and welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most striking findings emerging from such studies is the diversity that exists with respect to regulation of these hormones. For example, circulating levels of these hormones and the extent to which elevated glucocorticoids suppress the production of gonadal steroids are both highly variable across vertebrate species. This study examines adrenal glucocorticoids and gonadal steroids in a diploid-polyploid treefrog species complex to understand how polyploidization (duplication of the genome) contributes to this variation. Polyploidization is expected to drive modifications in hormonal regulation because associated changes in gene copy number can introduce novel gene expression patterns and/or increase rates of mutation that alter the expression of gene products governing hormone levels and hormonal interactions. The proposed study is relevant to understanding broad patterns of variation in hormonal regulation because polyploidy is a historical feature of vertebrates and a major source of variation in gene copy number in living vertebrates. This research will be integrated with summer research programs at the sponsoring institution to recruit at least eight high-school students from groups underserved in STEM fields to participate in the project. The project also involves training of undergraduate and graduate students and one post-doctoral associate, who will work closely with one another, high- school students, and the principal investigators, to cross-foster training and career development through peer mentoring.  <br/><br/>Circulating levels of adrenal glucocorticoids and gonadal steroids, and interactions between these hormones, are remarkably variable across vertebrates, but the genetic underpinnings giving rise to this diversity are poorly understood. This study examines endocrine regulation in polyploids to understand how associated changes in gene copy number (i.e., gene dosage) contribute to this extraordinary diversity. Polyploidization and associated changes in gene dosage can dramatically influence the evolution of the phenotype by altering gene expression patterns and/or by increasing gene mutation rates, but how polyploidization contributes to modifications in hormonal regulation remains largely unstudied. The proposed work examines regulation of adrenal glucocorticoids and gonadal steroids in three natural tetraploid gray treefrog lineages and their diploid ancestor to understand how polyploidization impacts endocrine control. By characterizing hormone levels and interactions between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes, comparing steroid receptor and binding protein mRNA expression levels and sequences, and examining steroid binding protein levels and kinetics in diploid and tetraploid treefrogs, this study will elucidate how changes in gene dosage through polyploidization impact hormonal regulation. The broader impacts of this research include diverse student involvement in field and lab-based interdisciplinary research in endocrinology, genetics, and neuroscience. Rural high-school students will be recruited to participate in the research during summers and the impact of their experiences will be assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rydberg states are electronically excited orbitals in atoms or molecules whose energy structure approximately follow that observed in atomic hydrogen. Key to many breakthroughs in atomic, molecular and optical physics, research during the last decade has also shown that much of the physics governing Rydberg dynamics in cold atoms finds a natural extension in condensed matter, thus hinting at novel technologies that simultaneously benefit from Rydberg traits and a solid-state implementation. This proposal brings together experimentalists and theorists at the City College of New York (CCNY) and the Center for Ultracold Atoms at Harvard/MIT to advance the understanding of Rydberg physics in novel solid-state systems comprising two-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap semiconductors. This cross-disciplinary team is ideally positioned to advance the scientific knowledge of this field as it combines experts in atomic and condensed matter physics with a know-how encompassing optical spectroscopy, materials science, nanofabrication, and fundamental solid-state modeling. Adding to the scientific objectives, a key goal of this PREP project is to establish a formal partnership that simultaneously increases and enriches the participation of students and postdocs belonging to groups that are most underrepresented in physics. To this end, the group will capitalize on successful minority recruitment channels to reach the broadest student population.<br/><br/>The work is organized around two distinct, though closely related material systems: The first set of activities zeroes in on the so-called ?exciton-polaritons?, hybrid quasiparticles emerging from the strong coupling between excitons and photons in a cavity. The focus is on polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides, whose Rydberg states will be investigated in the presence of magnetic field, strain, and dielectric engineering with special attention to polariton formation and non-linear interaction. Complementing this work, the group will investigate the formation of Rydberg states in neutral color centers in diamond, where hydrogenic orbitals ? crudely associated to a hole revolving a negatively-charged core ? emerge under resonant optical excitation. The group will experimentally explore and theoretically model Rydberg state dynamics in these systems, better understand the interplay between electronic spin polarization and Rydberg state creation, and investigate Rydberg blockade effects between adjacent color centers. The nature of the physical platforms investigated ? at the center of broad ongoing efforts yet minimally explored in their connection with Rydberg physics ? makes these activities of interest, particularly as a route to recreate in the solid state the features that make Rydberg states so attractive for applications in quantum information processing.  In addition, an extensive set of initiatives is envisioned aimed at advancing the career paths of students and postdocs including a science communication bootcamp, an ethics training course, a professional development seminar series, and an annual research symposium. The group is committed to instilling a sense of community, which will be realized through a close interaction between participating students in the form of regular virtual meetings (either led by the PIs or taking place informally) and student exchange between groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manufacturing semiconductor nanomaterials for energy storage possessing high electronic conductivity and high energy storage capacity could translate into batteries possessing larger ?fuel tanks? and is critical to the US economy. The current state-of-the-art in manufacturing of organic nanoparticles for energy storage applications produces particles of low electronic conductivity resulting in poor energy storage performance. Among nanomaterials, organic semiconducting nanoparticles are especially attractive for batteries due to solution processing properties that enable cost-effective implementation of these particles. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research seeking to enable scalable production of organic nanoparticles using an aerosol process through investigation of the interplay of aerosol formation and vapor phase chemistry. This research will determine the combined transport and chemical kinetics needed to control the synthetic pathways for the manufacturing of highly conductive particles in aerosol-based synthesis with controlled composition and size. The successful development of these new synthetic pathways would impact energy storage technologies by lowering costs for energy storage in devices and enabling development of light-weight batteries for transportation applications. The integrated educational program will contribute to the training of underrepresented high school, undergraduate and graduate students for careers in science, engineering, mathematics, and technology by leading project-based workshops that study aerosol science.<br/><br/>Manufacturing the next generation of active materials for batteries will require developing synthetic technologies competitive in an economy of scale. There is a lack of knowledge regarding molecular variables and experimental conditions that promote reactivity between aerosols of water droplets and vapors of organic molecules undergoing oxidative radical polymerization. This research aims to discover molecular correlations that enable control of polymerization kinetics and reaction mechanisms by investigating production and desiccation of water droplet aerosols with concomitant vapor-based polymerization within a flow reactor. Data produced by this research will inform manufacturing protocols that lead to kilogram-per-day production of organic semiconducting nanoparticles. This project will investigate organic-inorganic nanoparticle composites using Fe2O3, V2O5, Nb2O5, and MnO2 to produce particles characterized by intimate electronic contact between organic and inorganic components.

Separating each scale into individual simulations and coupling them together greatly lowers the execution time. The process of coupling the simulation is laborious,  complex, and error-prone. Achieving performance and energy efficiency requires domain scientists to have deep knowledge of computer architectures and systems, and extensively tune the algorithms and resource requests. The current state-of-the-practice of manual coupling and optimization leads to duplication of programming efforts and solutions that are not portable to new problems and sizes, and to computer architectures and systems. This interdisciplinary project builds technologies, namely HAM3R (Heterogeneous Automated Management of Multiscale Methods and Resources), to automate the coupling and optimize the computing and energy efficiency for multiscale simulations. HAM3R is broadly applicable to multiscale problems in computational chemistry, physics, biology, and materials science. Greater simplicity and flexibility of simulation codes have broad impacts on computational science by reducing the entry barrier to domain scientists. Enabling domain researchers to leverage advanced cyberinfrastructure will accelerate scientific throughput, which can have transformative effects across a spectrum of disciplines. This project broadens the engagement of students and underrepresented groups and user communities.  <br/> <br/>This project develops a versatile software framework (named HAM3R) for predictive resource, workload, fault, and power management that enables automated optimization of performance, scalability, and energy efficiency of multiscale models on heterogeneous HPC systems. HAM3R is a transformative software framework that removes the complexities of coupling multiscale simulations from domain scientists by enabling dynamic coupling of multiscale models that combines an API, library, and runtime to support broad coupling styles and domains. The  analysis of computation and data bottlenecks yields enhanced analytical and machine-learned performance models. HAM3R will equip multiscale models with automated resource allocation -- including predictive load-balancing by proactive management of computation, communication, and data movement -- to enable scalability and efficient simulations on heterogeneous HPC systems. This project?s Intellectual Merit advances the following areas: (1) data-centric optimizations to reduce the cost of data motion intra- and inter-scale by migrating computation and using lossy data compression; (2) customized local recovery for process failures; (3) model-predictive load balancing schemes within and across scales that support intelligent resource management and dynamic adaption; and (4) advanced power management across heterogeneous devices to ensure energy-efficient execution. The project demonstrates the capabilities of HAM3R in two different popular multiscale modeling frameworks: coupled molecular dynamics and lattice Boltzmann method simulations via domain decomposition; coupled dissipative particle dynamics and finite element method simulations via heterogeneous multiscale methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The movement of electrons and hydrogen ions in biological processes is fundamental to the chemistry of life. The mechanism of transfer of electrons in biological systems involves complex networks of electron carriers and hydrogen ion donors and remains poorly understood. DPD transfers two electrons from an electron donor to reduce a base, which initiates degradation in a class of bases that includes DNA and RNA. DPD has a complex set of cofactors that transmit the electrons one at a time over long distances, which is unlike any other similar enzyme. The study of this enzyme is expected to advance the understanding of how charge transfer is used to favor specific reactions. The graduate and undergraduate students engaged in this research will gain knowledge and experience in spectrophotometry, transient state kinetics, and X-ray crystallography. Students will also learn in a yearly free virtual kinetics workshop that will illustrate how kinetic ideas are employed to glean information about the properties of molecules.<br/><br/>DPD catalyzes the rate limiting step in the degradation of pyrimidine bases but it is significantly different from other dehydrogenases that accomplish similar chemistry. Specifically, DPD contains two flavin cofactors, FAD and FMN, separated by ~56 angstroms and connected by a molecular wire of four iron sulfur centers. The research plan is designed to test the hypotheses that pyrimidine reduction by DPD is the instigating step in the catalysis of base degradation and that NADPH is oxidized to backfill the enzyme and re-establish its two-electron reduced active state; in other words, the oxidative half reaction precedes the reductive half reaction. The research involves the modification of specific charged residues clustered around the FAD and FMN cofactors to slow or stall the passage of electrons through these junctions and thus to reveal different parts of the catalytic cycle. Specifically, mutations that reduce the number of negative charged residues proximal to the FAD will be used to raise the reduction potential of FAD and slow electron transfer to FMN. Similarly, mutations that reduce the number of positively charged residues near the FMN will be used to decrease its capacity to act as the electron sink. The research is designed in a way that makes it possible to track the movement of electrons and protons using combinations of variants with isotopic substitutions for substrates and solvent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using this three-pronged approach, this project will develop a suite of NGSS aligned formative assessment tasks for first-grade science and a set of instructional materials to support teachers as they administer the formative assessments to students with diverse language skills and capacities. These resources will be of high utility for classroom teachers in the early elementary grades and offer an important step towards meeting the need for useable NGSS aligned assessments for the early grades.

The elaboration of building blocks such as olefins, aromatics, and saturated hydrocarbons into more complex structures can be achieved by chemical reactions involving carbene fragments, which typically require metal catalysts to proceed efficiently. The best catalyst systems available currently rely heavily on rare and precious metals, which increases the cost of the resulting products and presents sustainability challenges due to limited resource availability. This research aims to develop design principles for earth-abundant metal complexes that can replace precious metals in carbene transfer catalysis. The development of iron- and cobalt-catalyzed processes in particular has the potential to improve fine chemical production in the United States.

The first aim of these studies is to establish how changes in the molecular structure and coordination geometry influence the electronic structures of the resulting complexes and their reactive metal carbenoid fragments. The second aim seeks to connect differences in electronic structure to changes in reactivity by studying  catalytically competent, isolable iron- and cobalt-carbene complexes.

The proposed complexes possess coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, potentially opening up new opportunities for the control of reactivity compared to previously reported iron-carbene complexes.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. One of the main goals of ecology is to understand the rules that underly how species respond to environmental change, and specifically whole community response to resource shifts. A large proportion of mammals are omnivores (that is, they eat both plant and animal-based foods), but we do not know linkage between omnivorous dietary traits, key physical traits such as jaw shape, and the environment. This lack of knowledge also prevents paleontologists from reconstructing omnivorous diets in the fossil record, ultimately limiting more complete understanding of long-term processes underlying biological innovation. This project aims to better understand linkages between omnivorous diets and jaw and dental shape and how diet and shape are structured across communities and landscapes. The results of this project will help inform future estimates of how mammals and communities will respond to environmental changes.<br/><br/>This project has two main objectives: 1) Characterize omnivore biogeography by assessing species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity in mammalian omnivores on the North American landscape; 2) Determine morphological adaptations tied to consuming different food materials in omnivorous mammals. These objectives will be accomplished by first developing a new database of North American mammalian diets that focuses on omnivore diet variation and the metadata of the primary data sources. The PI will use the newly developed diet database, species range maps, vegetation indexes, and previously published mammalian phylogenetic trees to test whether omnivore diet type and body mass limits omnivores to certain habitats or regions. Additionally, the PI will collect 3D scans of mammalian jaws and use machine learning approaches to test whether jaw morphology and dental topology vary in predictable ways among omnivores with differing diets.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration is now exploring technologies that can be deployed after O5 (circa 2028) to ensure the next sensitivity leap forward. This award funds work that will improve the sensitivity of current and future gravitational-wave detectors at low frequencies. This work will enable the detection of more and higher-fidelity astrophysical events, and increase access to high-mass black-hole collisions at cosmological distances. The work supported by this award will involve mechanical engineers and physicists, with opportunities for graduate students as well as undergraduate students (via the MIT UROP program) in both of these fields.<br/><br/>This ambitious goal can be reached by improving the detector's test mass suspension system to lower its vertical resonance frequency. This approach, coupled with heavier optic mass, can lead to a reduction of seismic, thermal and quantum radiation pressure noises. Several improvements will be considered, including: increasing the suspension length and the stress of the fibers that hold the test mass, and employing lower-noise sensors. These techniques can lead to an improved LIGO suspension system (in current facilities), and will also be applied in the next-generation gravitational-wave detector Cosmic Explorer. The proposed work will couple these two synergistic efforts by developing, together with the LIGO Laboratory, the Cosmic Explorer Project, and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a conceptual design for an improved suspension system for LIGO and an early design concept for the Cosmic Explorer suspension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The fellow will use cutting-edge gene-editing and molecular techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms governing the symbiosis between corals and algae that live with the coral, which is a key aspect of coral health. Climate change threatens the stability of this symbiosis and therefore can impact coral survival. Better understanding this relationship therefore may help with the development of solutions for coral survival. The fellow will support diversity and inclusion in the sciences by presenting their work at outreach events in Baltimore, MD, developing a hands-on curriculum for local K-12 students using a sea anemone, and by designing a research-based course for Oregon State University?s Invertebrate Biology lab.<br/><br/><br/>In cnidarian-algal photosymbiosis, the algal symbiont resides within a phagosomal membrane, called the symbiosome. Proteins localize to the symbiosome membrane to maintain symbiosis, and several of these proteins are shared among hosts that evolved photosymbiosis independently. The fellow will characterize the symbiosome membrane proteome in two divergent cnidarian lineages that have independently gained photosymbiosis: the sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana and the coral Acropora millepora. To characterize the symbiosome membrane proteome, first, algal cells will be isolated from each host species and symbiosome-positive algal cells will be enriched with antibody labeling and flow cytometry. Then, symbiosome membrane proteins will be purified with biochemistry and identified using tandem mass spectrometry. The fellow will then test the function of symbiosome membrane proteins by knocking out each gene with CRISPR/Cas9 in the two host species. Knockout larvae will be inoculated with algal symbionts and symbiont density will be measured. Knockouts of genes critical for symbiosis are predicted to have a strong effect on symbiont density, while those that are less vital will have weaker effects. Finally, the fellow will develop a course-based undergraduate research experience at Oregon State University where students will characterize the gene expression of symbiosome membrane proteins in E. diaphana larvae through a time course during the early stages of symbiosis. Expression of these genes are expected to vary temporally depending on their function. The fellow will be trained by his sponsors in bioinformatics, proteomics, CRISPR/cas9 knockout techniques, and curriculum development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of scientific publishing is the dissemination of robust research findings, exposing them to the scrutiny of peers and other interested parties. Scientific articles should accurately and completely provide information on the origin and provenance of data and on the analytical and computational methods used. Yet in recent years, doubts about the adequacy of the information provided in scientific articles and their addenda have been voiced. This has been called the replication crisis. The conferences will address the following topics: the initiation of research, the conduct of research, the preparation of research for publication, and the scrutiny after publication. The products of these meetings will be available to any non-participant through videos, presentations materials, and manuscripts.  Undergraduates, graduate students, and career researchers will be able to learn about best practices for transparent, reproducible, and scientifically sound research in the social sciences. Research that follows the best practices discussed in the various meetings will be more verifiable, and thus more credible. These qualities are especially important for policy makers that wish to implement evidence-based policymaking, and a public that wishes to understand the foundations of such policies.<br/><br/>Scientific practices throughout the conduct of the research, during peer review, and after the dissemination of results all interact to enable a discourse about the veracity of scientific claims. The investigators will organize a sequence of conferences discussing educational and procedural barriers slowing down adoption of best practices, whether journals should be the verifiers of reproducibility, whether (and how) scientists' work can be made to be reproducible at every stage of the research process, and implications thereof for funding, technical infrastructure, and the training of undergraduate and graduate students. The topics chosen for the series are not usually part of disciplinary seminars or conferences and will be brought to a broader audience here for the first time. Most sessions will be held virtually (online), but others will be co-located with or submitted as complete sessions to professional meetings. The availability of permanent artifacts (presentations, recordings, manuscripts) after the conferences will allow this to be a resource with persistent impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IESP has been an active research topic in the engineering, mathematics, and physics communities for the past three decades due to its impact on a wide range of applications including radar, nondestructive testing, medical imaging, and geophysical exploration. However, solving the IESP is very challenging since this problem is in general highly nonlinear and severely ill-posed. Therefore, although computational algorithms have been extensively studied for the IESP, there is still a high demand for algorithms with improved efficiency and robustness. The project addresses this demand by developing new and highly efficient sampling-type algorithms for the IESP in the context of optics and radar. This project will also involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational mathematics.   <br/><br/>Solving the IESP involves proper sampling methods to construct an approximate indicator function for the unknown scattering object. Ideally these sampling methods are fast, non-iterative, and do not require a priori information about the scattering object. In this project, the principal investigator and graduate students will develop new sampling-type methods for the IESP for both the Helmholtz equation and the system of Maxwell's equations in different types of scattering media, including infinite periodic media, small and point-like objects, bounded inhomogeneous media, and nonlinear media. In addition to the aforementioned features, the sampling-type methods that will be developed in this project will be simple to implement and extremely robust against noise in the data. The resolution and stability analysis of these sampling-type methods and their validation by experimental data will be investigated. The new methods are expected to provide a promising alternative tool to solve the IESP in optics and radar.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will fund research that enables reliable assurance of safety-critical metal components, for example those used in the aerospace and nuclear power industries, thereby promoting the progress of science, and advancing the national prosperity and welfare. Thermomechanical processes that occur during manufacturing of metal parts result in grain microstructures that dictate strength, fatigue life, and creep and corrosion resistance. It is essential that these microstructures be carefully controlled during production and non-destructively characterized once a component is finished. Although ultrasound technology is the only practical means to access internal material properties, it has seen very limited industrial usage, as accurate interpretation of ultrasonic signals in terms of such microstructure remains an unsolved problem. Alternative techniques that rely on destructive testing of sacrificial samples after elaborate preparation are recognized as inadequate, as evidenced for example by failures of aircraft engines. This project will overcome these shortcomings by advancing a new method of interpreting ultrasonic wave scattering due to microstructural texture and inhomogeneities, potentially revolutionizing the use of non-destructive, contactless, ultrasonic characterization throughout production and in service, at elevated temperatures and on complex shapes. This capability will support the growth of new advanced manufacturing processes, whose vital need of quality control and assurance on complex geometries is currently only partially met. Collaboration with Dr. Bo Lan of Imperial College London will provide opportunities for international research exchange and training of postdoctoral scientists, as well as routes for industry outreach facilitated through the United Kingdom Research Centre in Nondestructive Evaluation.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental contributions to the development of an ultrasonic diffuse wave field method that enables volumetric characterization of mission critical microstructure of engineering metals. It will achieve this objective by designing and calibrating experimental transduction mechanisms and signal processing techniques for extracting the full Green?s tensor from the diffuse wave field on different sample geometries, and relating properties of diffusivity, attenuation, and scattering to microstructure-related properties. Further, a general multiple scattering theory will be derived in combination with radiative transfer theory, to account for the effects of texture and microstructures on coherent waves and to describe the incoherent wave diffusion. Computational models of such wave diffusion will be validated against experimental results and used to construct a knowledge database of quantitative linkages between the diffuse wave field and material microstructures. Finally, a robust inversion method will be developed for deducing critical microstructural properties from the diffuse wave field data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of low cost, portable and reliable devices for analyzing disease-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for example, acetone, the biomarker of diabetes, in human breath has been a both attractive and competitive frontier in medical diagnostics, therapy control, and health management. The great progress in the synthesis of advanced materials, especially nano-structured materials, and the invention of new manufacturing techniques provide an opportunity to design and fabricate advanced medical devices that can do noninvasive diagnosis, are inexpensive and portable, and are therefore suitable for use at home or clinics. Two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXene) are an emerging family of nanomaterials which hold great promise in enhancing the performance of electric devices in view of their multi-layered, porous structures, high surface-to-volume ratio, rich and tunable surface chemistry and excellent conductivity. 3D printing is a versatile technique which offers a simple, less material-wasting strategy for the rapid and straightforward prototyping of bespoke 3D architectures. The combination of sensing material, MXene nanocomposites and 3D printing may potentially lead to advanced, scalable, low-cost, and high-performance sensing devices for daily health monitoring and early disease screening. Along with the scientific contribution, the project will also promote undergraduate and graduate education through expanding material science curriculum in Engineering and creating undergraduate research positions targeting American Natives and female students, and benefit K-12 students via local non-profit organization, uCodeGirl and Nature program.<br/><br/>This project will develop an advanced breath acetone sensor constructed with nanocomposite of K2W7O22 (KWO) nanowires and layer structured Ti4C3 MXene nanosheets, in which KWO serves as the sensing material and MXene functions to not only enhance the sensor performance as the supporting material but also make the sensing material become 3D printable and accordingly enable the sensor device to gain a desired 3D architecture with an enhancement in the repeatability, flexibility and stability.  The primary goal of the project is to deliver a novel breath analysis-based sensor device for daily diabetes health monitoring. The research will involve (1) the synthesis of 1D/2D KWO/Ti4C3 MXene nanocomposite sensing materials that demonstrate satisfactory sensitivity and selectivity in detecting breath acetone, (2) the development of a formulation of KWO/Ti4C3  nanocomposite ink for the fabrication of acetone sensors with controllable pattern and 3D architecture via direct ink writing (DIW), and (3) the formation of a prototype of breath acetone sensor that features high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, high signal to noise ratio, unprecedented signal reliability, room-temperature operation, scalable manufacturing, low cost and being portable. Success in this project will provide a guidance to the design and fabrication of functional nanomaterial-based gas sensors which utilize 3D architecture to boost sensor performance and use 3D printing technique to achieve mass production and reproducible fabrication of the sensor devices. The approach can be readily extended to other applications, such as sensors for pandemic prevention, affordable life-time medical devices for chronic diseases management, scaffold sensors for cancer biomarker detection, and air/water/food quality control for long-term health protection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To make hydrogen, the nanocrystal is first excited by light, increasing the energy of its electrons. These excited electrons must then hop from the nanocrystal to the enzyme, and then make their way to the enzyme's reaction center by hopping from one site to another, like crossing a stream by jumping from stone to stone. Each of these electron hops is important for hydrogen production, but they are difficult to observe and control. Professor Dukovic and her students will measure the times of the critical electron hopping events, and how they depend on nanocrystal structure, surface properties, and binding to the enzyme. Their discoveries could lead to new ways to use sunlight to make chemicals, including solar fuels. Additionally, the project is helping to foster the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by supporting career development of junior faculty and scientists, as well as the undergraduate education of students from a variety of backgrounds.  <br/><br/>This project will elucidate the electron pathways involved in photochemical H2 generation that occurs when photoexcited semiconductor nanocrystals transfer electrons to the adsorbed enzyme hydrogenase, which catalyzes proton reduction to H2.

The outcome of the project will be an improved understanding of how nanocrystals drive enzyme catalysis. This, in turn, will lead to design principles for how to use the immense tunability of nanocrystal structure and properties to adapt them to drive complex, multi-step light-driven chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The projects aims to meet present and anticipated Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) workloads in various research group on campus. Twenty-first century science and engineering is being transformed by the increasing scales of research computing and data. Despite the increase in the demand for large-scale and data-centric computational resources, it is still a struggle to provide domain scientists with the necessary tools and support at campus-levels. Specifically, decentralized computing practices not only bottleneck research because of lack of scale and support, but also decouple computing from higher performance and deeper storage and networks. Accordingly, shifts in institutional cyberinfrastructure strategies are required, with the following guiding priorities: (1) improving user friendly access; (2) removing perceived barriers in the use of scalable infrastructure; and (3) building multidisciplinary communities for next-generation workflows.<br/><br/>The University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) will add a new A100 GPU-based cluster to its pre-existing CPU cluster to introduce a new set of paradigms for interdisciplinary computing infrastructure and expand access across campus.

It provides geographic insights on the ways that design thinking drives the distribution of valuable resources (e.g., light, furniture, electronics) within buildings, how diverse occupants use resources and attach meaning to them, how resource use is also determined by other social and environmental variables, and how these relationships are affected by resilience to disruptions. This project builds on theories from geographical sciences, cultural anthropology, complex systems science, computer vision, architecture, and mathematics. Its data collection system establishes a smart and connected living-laboratory with potential to extend to other projects. This project also supports interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education and multiple forms of public communication. <br/><br/>This project contributes to a growing area of research that addresses the social value of buildings. In the United States, individuals spend high amounts of time living and working indoors. As a result, buildings are increasingly designed to promote certain behaviors such as movement, collaboration, creativity, and community. Spaces are designed and built with hopes that they become meaningful places to the people that use them, but conceptual understandings of the space-to-place process remains underdeveloped. Therefore, this longitudinal project examines this process within a mixed residential/academic building that serves diverse functions. Using multiple methods that include sensor-based technologies, interviews, and qualitative ethnography, the researchers have multiple objectives. First, the research examines how spaces and resources are conceptualized, created, and distributed by administrators and designers. In addition, the researchers study when and where resources are used, and what symbolic meanings are associated with their use. The study also examines how the uses and meanings related to spaces respond to disruptions in the patterns of use. The results of this work can help administrators and designers to create more human-centric shared indoor spaces with greater potential to facilitate positive outcomes. The project also contributes to student training and broadening participation in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deming of the University of California-Los Angeles is preparing and studying the aqueous self-assembly of synthetic copolypeptide amphiphiles containing dehydroamino acids.  Polypeptides are among the most important biopolymers and are basically long chain macromolecules consisting of amino acids linked together by a particular kind of a chemical bond called a peptide bond or link.  All living organisms contain numerous polypeptides and cannot exist without them.  Amphiphilic copolymers, on the other hand, are polymers that possess both water-loving and oil-loving properties.  They are typically found in soaps and detergents and are also the main component of cell membranes.  In this research, copolypeptides containing dehydroalanine segments will first be synthesized using a suite of chemical reaction sequences.  The assemblies of these polymers will then be investigated in water in order to understand how the extended conformation of hydrophobic (oil-loving) dehydroalanine segments influences assembly structure.  The synthesized polymers will also be subjected to chemical modifications in order to further understand structural changes in these assemblies when they are exposed to biological conditions that mimic those found in the human body.  These studies have the potential to advance the knowledge on self-assembly of complex biopolymers and are also of relevance to the development of stimuli responsive biomaterials for therapeutic delivery applications.  The research will provide interdisciplinary teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students and unique opportunities for inclusion of underrepresented groups.  The team will continue interactions and outreach with local universities with majority Hispanic student populations.  Participations in ?Meet the ACS Editors? events at national conferences will afford advice on preparation and review of manuscripts to young scientists and encourage URM and female junior faculty to participate in journal activities and organize ACS National Meeting symposia.  <br/><br/>This research will focus on the design, synthesis and systematic study of self-assembly of novel diblock copolypeptide amphiphiles containing poly(dehydroalanine) (ADH) segments in order to learn how the extended conformations of ADH chains of varying lengths influence self-assembled structures. Following the identification of compositions useful for the formation of ordered assemblies, ionic hydrophilic segments will be replaced with non-ionic and biocompatible poly(L-methionine sulfoxide). This modification will enable evaluation of simultaneous switching of conformation and solubility in copolypeptides. The use of non-ionic segments is also expected to impart improved downstream cell and animal compatibility.  All copolypeptides will be purified by dialysis and characterized using a suite of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques.  Lastly, a biomimetic chemical modification of ADH and other segments in block copolypeptides will be investigated in order to further understand how assembled structures respond to changes in both segment conformations and solubilities. Outcomes of these studies will provide new insights on how chain conformation switching under biologically relevant conditions can enhance the development and advancement of stimuli responsive biomaterials, in particular those amenable for intracellular therapeutic delivery. The methodology developed in this research significantly lowers the barriers for synthetic access to ADH-containing copolymers.  Coupled with in-depth examination of the relationships between copolypeptide composition and self-assembled structures, the knowledge gained has the potential to advance the field of biomimetic polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanocelluloses have been shown to be excellent building block materials to form low-cost and effective water purification media, such as anionic bio-adsorbents and membrane barrier layers. The incorporation of functional metal oxide nanoparticles in the nanocellulose scaffold can create new types of sustainable cationic bioadsorbents and photocatalysts for water purification while also eliminating typical adverse effects of using nanoparticles in environmental remediation. However, there are some fundamental knowledge gaps in fully understanding the structure-property-process/synthesis relationships during the creation of hierarchically structured nanocellulose-metal oxide nanocomposites that can maintain stability and effectiveness in the aqueous environment. This project aims to investigate several fundamental issues of and provide new insights into the subject and fill those knowledge gaps. The benefits of using such nanocomposites for water purification have only begun to be realized, demonstrating particular importance as climate change has increased the frequency and severity of clean-water shortage. In additiopn to the research, a range of educational activities will be developed to engage post-doc, graduate, undergraduate (especially minority and women scientists) and high school students, in focusing on access to safe drinking water as an issue of global sustainability while learning about the fundamental concepts of sustainability and water purification.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to understand and control the incorporation of model cationic metal oxide nanoparticles into anionic cellulose nanofiber scaffolds of different charge density and degree of fibrillation, aiming to create new functional nanocomposites from renewable and sustainable sources for water purification. The specific aims of this project are two. (1) Understand the effects of nanocellulose structure and functionality on the transport and interactions of metal oxide nanoparticles during mixing and in-situ synthesis processes in the formation of nanocomposites. Two model nanoparticle (NP) systems are chosen: (i) aluminium oxide (Al2O3) NPs with sizes in the range of nanocellulose scaffold pore sizes to explore effective and anomalous diffusion processes through the mixing approach to form stable and homogeneous composite frameworks, and (ii) ?white? and ?black? (low-band gap) titanium oxide (TiO2) NPs that will be formed in-situ through synthesis, and nucleation/growth processes to understand critical factors that can control the structure and properties of nanocomposites. The NP transport and formation mechanisms, as well as the resulting dynamics behavior will be evaluated against the morphology, degree of fibrillation, and electrostatic properties of the nanocellulose scaffolds. (2) Develop advanced characterization and modeling techniques that can reveal the structure-property-processing relationships during nanocomposite formation. The primary processing-structure characterization methods will include shear-free mixing combined with in-situ scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), and other spectroscopic techniques using synchrotron radiations, while the performance evaluation will be focused on adsorption of anionic contaminants (e.g., fluorides and nitrates) and photocatalytic degradation by solar radiation.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those who do the least to cause climate change are often the most vulnerable to its impacts, so it is important to consider the needs of these populations to support a ""just transition"" to renewable energy. As a result, there is a need for a broader and more diverse ""STEM- and equity-literate workforce"" ?  knowledgeable about STEM, possessing requisite thinking skills, and committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. This project proposes to make use of an existing energy transition/climate change simulation experience, En-ROADS, followed by student energy projects to help learners come to understand the issues involved in energy transition and its environmental justice implications. This intervention is intended to advance climate literacy, STEM efficacy, a solutions-focused mindset, and thinking skills. The innovation of this project lies in pairing undergraduates with high school (HS) students as near-peer mentors, with preference given to minority students during recruitment. The undergraduate near-peer mentors will assist the high school students with the simulation activities and with using the knowledge gained from the simulation to create a real-world energy transition project for their local setting. The project is a partnership between universities, local climate change organizations, and a local minority-owned clean energy business, to connect the learners with authentic challenges and career paths in their area. By impacting hundreds of students, the project aims to diversify STEM undergraduate education and the STEM and energy/climate professional and technical workforces in Minnesota, as well as to enhance citizen decision-making by increasing STEM knowledge about energy systems, climate impacts and policy implications. <br/><br/>The research questions interrogate the impact of near-peer mentoring on student outcomes (STEM efficacy, STEM knowledge, hope and urgency with regards to climate issues, knowledge and interest in STEM/ICT careers), on the mentors? STEM/ICT career aspirations, and also explore the synergistic impact of project components on students? ability to make connections across the learning opportunities. To address the research questions, 7 high school student-undergraduate teams where the university students provide near-peer mentoring will be compared to 7 high school student-undergraduate teams participating in the same simulation and energy project activities but without near-peer mentoring. The research questions will be addressed via pre/post survey data and via a Grounded Theory analysis of focus group and interview data. Focus groups and interviews will also be used to explore how mentors supported the learners. The contribution to the field arises from the fact that the research questions specifically probe how one strategy, near-peer mentoring, may enhance simulation-based and project-based learning. This project will increase our knowledge about how simulations can be used to prepare learners to engage in real-world projects of personal significance ? in other words, it is a demonstration project to show how simulation-based learning can be situated within a larger real-world tapestry of community and career engagement, as opposed to a stand-alone activity intended to convey STEM knowledge alone. The project will produce a series of guides (a standards-aligned curriculum guide, student-led project facilitator guide, and an energy/climate career guide local to the state) that will be disseminated via a number of established networks to permit other educators to emulate the program. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses an evidence-based approach in which student teams are sent on classroom missions to solve contemporary cybersecurity problems. Mission-based learning increases student engagement and helps to improve the technical, problem-solving, metacognitive, and interpersonal skills that are needed to apply cybersecurity principles in the cybersecurity workforce. As students complete their missions, they learn cybersecurity theories and the approaches cybercriminals take to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The missions will also provide students with an opportunity to develop the skills required to work individually and in teams. Students will conduct research and learn to think like cybercriminals to better understand adversarial practices and to develop the defensive skills required to respond to these practices. The lesson plans for the cybersecurity missions will serve as a blueprint for other instructors interested in transforming their teaching approach by adopting mission-based learning into their cybersecurity programs.<br/><br/>This project will advance our knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity education, by introducing the mission-based learning model, and evaluating its effectiveness as a learning method in cybersecurity. The project team will develop instructor and student lesson plan materials for a set of missions in an existing computer science course. Senior undergraduate or graduate computer science students will be recruited and trained to serve as coaches for students during their missions. The project aims to answer the following research question: how does mission-based learning improve cybersecurity education with respect to student achievement, competency, and attitude? This project will advance our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using adversarial practices to teach cybersecurity and will help instructors to design cybersecurity educational materials that utilize the adversarial practice approach. To extend the impact of this project, the lesson plans will be disseminated to the national cybersecurity community through publications, websites, and workshops. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.

MorphoSource is a web accessible data repository that is uniquely specialized for 3D/2D image data representing physical specimens from museum or lab collections. Sources of 3D data include CT scanners (a common source of 3D imagery), laser scanners, photogrammetry modeling and more. Over the last decade, MorphoSource has initiated a revolution in the study of anatomy through unprecedented data access. In addition to providing digital data and tools for scientists to conduct research, MorphoSource also supports public engagement and is being widely used for public education and outreach. By making 3D data discoverable and accessible, MorphoSource helps neutralize access limitations due to geography, capability of travel, fragility of material, or high demand. By making web accessible 3D imagery available to any student with a basic computer or mobile device, MorphoSource broadens inclusivity in use of biodiversity and natural history museum collections in a way that was never previously possible.<br/><br/>In 2013, MorphoSource.org was created to enable broad access to digitized ?virtual specimens? and 3D data for advanced analyses of anatomic phenotypes.  MorphoSource has since become a vital research resource for 3D data on anatomical form of specimens in biodiversity and natural history collections. MorphoSource has been cited by ~1,100 papers for data access or archiving and served a growing, active community of 15,000 users (with ~1,600 data contributors). Achieving this status has hinged largely on its standards-based data model, file format expertise, rich management tools, and collaboratively developed policies. Furthermore, MorphoSource supports deep integrations with a variety of federally-funded bioinformatic platforms and is a natural and robust partner in national efforts at digitization of biodiversity collections for handling 3D needs. With unprecedented depth of taxonomic sampling and a powerful 3D web viewer, Morphosource has already enabled start-to-finish studies of large-scale patterns in anatomical variation from ?virtual specimens? for the first time. The ability to access and measure nuanced anatomical variation in massive numbers of specimens is essential to realizing NSF?s visionary goals of leveraging computer science frontiers like machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence in biological research. This NSF award will allow MorphoSource to continue serving its diverse communities as they grow for the next five years and to further develop policies and procedures that will eventually empower certain segments of user communities to help support the platform. Results from studies that leverage MorphoSource are frequently published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings and in numerous outreach and training presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project at Fayetteville State University will address the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches on society and its potential benefits. Almost every area of human knowledge from the sciences and engineering, humanities and the arts, can be potentially enhanced by AI. Computing applications are being developed and deployed to provide AI support for data-driven decisions that have real effects on the lives of people. AI algorithms have been adopted to solve different problems in healthcare, law enforcement, military, and government, to name only a few major areas. While it will take more time and effort to realize its full potential in these areas, the risks of adopting AI is an urgent and important problem because it can potentially cause harm when it is prematurely deployed before being tested for trustworthiness. <br/><br/><br/>This project is based on AI research and educational research that suggest computing and non-computing curricula can benefit from customized modules that expose students to the knowledge of AI and the trustworthiness of AI models. The trustworthiness and social relevance of AI is a profoundly multi-disciplinary effort, and the project is leveraging the knowledge of researchers and educators from various disciplines. The Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) will be used for creating inquiry-based activities that will be completed by students in teams. Most activities involve hands-on, experimental work with AI models that are executed within a sandbox software environment. Through immersion in this process students will understand how AI models work and how to assess trust, which is essential when taking actions based on the predictions of models, or when deploying a new model. This guided process also provides insights into the inner working of AI models, which students can use to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. A novel repository of educational materials will be created to support the adoption of AI in non-computing disciplines and to strengthen the computing curricula with content that has traditionally not received adequate coverage. This project adds to the growing body of knowledge on how to motivate the study of AI, how to prepare students for the modern-day workplace where both AI skills and domain knowledge are important, and how to train informed and socially responsible creators and users of AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior ethnographic and archaeological research indicates that among hunter-gatherers abundance and predictability of food resources mediate how often and how far groups move, and if they maintain a defended territory. Recent ancient DNA work has shown that by the end of the last glacial cycle , foragers in eastern and southern-central Africa that had once had widespread biological interactions began to live in small groups with little genetic exchange. Local ecological conditions may have been instrumental in shaping patterns of hunter-gatherer interactions, but researchers lack long-term data on how foragers adapted their land use systems to environmental change in this region. The researchers will investigate how the distribution of game animals varied seasonally over multiple millenia and how this affected hunter-gatherer land use as inferred from the archaeological record. The position of the study area in the tropics makes it especially important to reconstruct rainfall seasonality through time, which depends on millennial-scale changes in the position of the Earth relative to the sun and has enormous impact on local plant and animal communities. This project will provide a better understanding of the factors influencing collective decision-making in small-scale societies when they are confronted with novel ecological conditions and link these factors to changes in social interactions. This knowledge will also provide a conceptual framework to understand changes in lifeways as traditional societies around the world are impacted by climate change. <br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the link between ecology and land use through the lens of the Economic Defendability Model, which posits that when resources are abundant and spatiotemporally predictable human groups will tend to establish stable territories. Specifically, they will test the hypothesis that these conditions were met after the Last Glacial Maximum with the onset of the modern monsoonal regimen. They will collect zooarchaeological, biogeochemical and chronological data from four rockshelter sites. Archaeological animal remains will provide information about which species were hunted at different times in the past, and how they were transported and utilized in response to territorial behavior.

Drs. Tomco and Redman at the University of Alaska-Anchorage will investigate the environmental breakdown rates of three contaminants found in Alaskan waterways, as caused by sunlight. The mechanism of this process can be unique to cold, high-latitude regions, where extreme seasonal changes in daily sunlight exposure occur. Several factors that affect this process will be investigated, including the role of natural organic matter, reactive oxygen species, and temperature dependence. The breakdown products formed as each contaminant degrades will be identified. This study is expected inform the development of predictive water quality assessments that can be useful for identifying the attenuation rates in these systems. The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in research, provide opportunities to learn advanced instrumental methods in mass spectrometry, and target inclusion of Alaska Native students and women to work toward broadening participation in such physical science studies.<br/><br/>This study will investigate the aquatic photochemical pathways by which emerging contaminants in the sub-Arctic are degraded and the extent to which high latitude environmental factors will impact persistence. Subarctic environmental conditions have a unique timeline of contaminant attenuation compared to temperate conditions, and a unique relative contribution of direct and indirect processes. This study specifically assesses three priority compounds: 12?-hydroxy-rotenone, 6-PPD quinone, and fluridone. 6-PPD quinone is the quinonoid oxidation product from oxidation of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N?-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, a widely used tire additive and anti-oxidant. Each of these have recently been detected persistently in Alaskan waterways, but no information exists regarding photochemical pathways and photo-transformation products in natural waters. This study will determine individual contributions of dissolved organic matter, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and triplet excitation states. The temperature dependence of each process will be compared at 4, 12, and 20 degrees C, which spans the typical range of surface water temperatures. Photoproducts resulting from each process will be profiled using high resolution mass spectrometry combined with non-targeted analytical approaches. This information is expected to provide a better fundamental understanding of the environmental drivers for these photochemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As it is extremely costly to develop a brand new OS, a large number of downstream OS kernels are derived from an upstream OS kernel (e.g., Linux) to save development costs. However, this also means that the security of the downstream kernels are dependent on timely patch propagation from the upstream to downstream. The diversity and decentralized nature of downstreams causes delays or even missed upstream patches altogether. Even worse, due to customizations in the downstreams, it is time-consuming to infer which bugs are applicable to downstream and worth patching. Finally, even if they know an upstream vulnerability exists in a downstream and a patch is available, it may require additional efforts to port and test upstream patches --- a significant hurdle for many downstream vendors who are wary of breaking things.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a series of automated and novel analyses to reason about patches, bug behaviors, and their impacts. More specifically, the project will include an analysis of upstream patches and infer which ones fix critical bugs; it will automatically infer which downstreams are affected by an upstream bug and what security impact it bears; it will understand whether the corresponding upstream patch can be applied safely and correctly. The results of the project will alleviate the human burden in analyzing, reviewing, and adopting patches.

The prospective low-cost and non-toxic candidates such as silicon, however, show extremely low electricity to light conversion efficiency in their conventional arrangement. This project integrates the unique quantum effects in nanoscale silicon and tin alloying to produce silicon-tin and silicon-germanium-tin nanoparticles with size and composition tunable superior light absorption and emission properties for visible to infrared applications. The research team combines the material synthesis efforts with computational calculations and advanced optical and structural characterizations to garner a comprehensive understanding of the physical and optical properties and stability of nanoscale alloys. The collaborative nature of this research provides multidisciplinary training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, to develop skills in materials design and synthesis, computational chemistry, nanoscience, and advanced optical spectroscopy.

However, the narrow energy gaps and the extremely low solubility of Sn in Si and Ge hindered their fabrication and widespread application in visible to infrared optoelectronic studies. This project exploits the concerted influences of quantum confinement effects, Sn nano-alloying, and solution-phase synthesis to produce metastable Si-Sn and Si-Ge-Sn alloys and quantum dots (QDs) with size and composition tunable direct energy gaps and superior absorption and emission properties across visible to infrared spectrum. A series of monodisperse alloys having various sizes and compositions are produced by innovative colloidal chemistry methods. The influences of Sn alloying and quantum confinement on optical properties are thoroughly and systematically probed via steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence and pump/probe transient absorption spectroscopy, guided by first-principles electronic structure and thermodynamic stability calculations. Experiments are designed to probe confinement- and composition-induced direct-gaps of silicon, dark vs. bright excitonic states and their dependence on nanocrystal size and composition, and carrier relaxation mechanisms involving QD core, surface, and their hybrid states to optimize the radiative efficiency. These later efforts along with solution processing and high thermal and optical stability of nanocrystal alloys enable the future design of high-efficiency, silicon-based optoelectronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to harness a new class of ultrathin oxide layers formed on the surface of the molten metals gallium and indium to efficiently fabricate highly conductive and ultra-transparent nanosheets. The primary goal of this work is to thoroughly understand and precisely control the nanoscale atomic composition, crystallinity, and electron transport properties of these 2D oxide materials by stacking multiple layers and by engineering the oxidation of liquid metal alloys formed from tin, zinc, and gallium. These methods enhance the electron mobility and light transmittance, as well as tuning of the electron concentration in these materials for enabling applications to photodetectors, solar cells, and displays. Integrated with the research efforts, this plan builds on practices that have successfully engaged undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research to train a diverse and inclusive engineering workforce. The education plan involves development of remote deployable liquid metal science demonstrations for experiential learning by undergraduates and K-12 students.

These high-performance transparent conducting materials leverage a fundamentally new synthetic strategy for printing 2D oxide nanosheets from the solid oxide skin of liquid metals. Initial studies of 2D oxides reveal their unique overlapping grain morphologies, quantum-confined electronic structure, and ultrahigh electron mobility. This work identifies the nanoscale material origins of these exceptional optoelectronic properties and controls the composition, crystallinity, and conductivity of multicomponent 2D oxides by engineering the physics of liquid metal surface oxidation. These studies specifically investigate how metal alloy composition impacts the logarithmic growth kinetics of surface oxidation and then connect this process physics with 2D oxides? chemical composition through detailed material characterization. These experiments test the hypothesis that surface-driven defect modulation doping from type-II heterojunctions with insulating wide bandgap oxides (e.g. gallium oxide) can directly enhance the conductivity of 2D metal oxides. Extracting the electronic density of states in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy can also quantitatively link alloy composition with the surface oxides? electronic structure.

The standard approach to training DNNs is to optimize an end-to-end cost function based on variants of gradient descent. This simple approach is flexible, allowing innovation in architectures and applications, and scaling to neural networks with a large number of parameters, given enough data and computational power. Such end-to-end, or top-down training, however, does not provide control over, or understanding of, the features being extracted by the layers of the neural networks. The vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks, for example, is a symptom of this phenomenon. The proposed research seeks to address these drawbacks using ideas from communication theory and neuroscience: the goal is to actively shape the features being extracted by individual layers of the neural network, in addition to training the overall network to attain an end-to-end goal. This research will contribute to curricular enhancements in signal processing and machine learning explored via courses, REU projects and senior capstone projects.<br/><br/>The proposed technical approach leverages the existing computational infrastructure for training, while imposing layer-by-layer constraints aimed at producing sparse, strong activations. Drawing on ideas from communication theory, the goal is to learn ?matched filters? which enhance the ?signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)? at neuron outputs at each layer. One may show that this approach is consistent with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian (HAH) learning as posited in neuroscience, in which neurons that are strongly activated for an input are promoted, with less active neurons being demoted. This work posits enhanced robustness via such an SNR-maximizing strategy, together with additional nonlinear transformations such as divisive normalization borrowed from neuroscience. While preliminary visualizations indicate more interpretable neurons, there is reason to expect sparse, strong activations to be more amenable to quantitative interpretation via statistical and information-theoretic analysis. The goal of the proposed research is two-fold: to gain theoretical insight into HAH-based learning via toy models, and to demonstrate practical gains in robustness and interpretability relative to state of the art DNNs. Experimental evaluations will initially be conducted on image datasets which provide standard performance benchmarks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Light can excite an electron to higher energy, leaving an electron vacancy or a hole in these materials. The oppositely charged electron and hole are attracted to each other and can be bound into a pair, often referred to as an exciton. How well these excitons move in the halide perovskites is critical to optimize their applications but is poorly understood. Preliminary results from the research team suggest these excitons can be highly mobile in these materials. In this project, the principal investigator aims to apply novel spatially and temporally resolved experimental techniques to illustrate the physical mechanisms of the formation and transport of excitons in halide perovskites. The project will open up new opportunities by taking advantage of excitons in halide perovskites for novel electronic applications.

The principal investigator plans to prepare students with the skills and knowledge to pursue research and development in novel materials and photovoltaics with industrial partners. <br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Excitons are often given negative connotation in solar energy harvesting in part due to their presumed short diffusion lengths. Contradicting this, the research team has recently demonstrated carrier diffusion lengths up to 200 micrometers in halide perovskites, implying that exciton transport may not limit the energy conversion process in these materials. Based on these exciting preliminary results, the project aims to understand highly mobile excitons as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling effects on exciton transport, in both three-dimensional and low-dimensional single-crystal halide perovskite nano- and micro-structures.  The project will investigate single-crystal halide perovskite field effect transistors with comprehensive temperature-dependent spatially, energetically, and temporally resolved optoelectronic techniques.

Dispersal is important for evolution because it influences how much populations found in different places exchange genes (gene flow), and therefore whether they will evolve into different species or stay connected as one. However, dispersal is difficult to study and poorly understood owing to the difficulty of tracking small animals. Migratory birds, for example, undergo staggering round trip migrations each year, but it remains unclear how these migratory movements influence the movement of genes between populations. This research uses genomic tools and migration tracking tags to investigate the dynamics of gene flow in migratory birds. In so doing, the research will shed light on how and why long-distance migration evolved. The project will develop a multimedia public exhibit at a natural history museum that explores the biology of migration and the threats facing migratory birds. The researchers will also convene a workshop to address how migratory bird deaths from building collisions can be mitigated and how data from bird building collisions can be used for scientific and conservation purposes. Finally, the proposed research will facilitate experiential learning opportunities for students to track migratory birds.<br/><br/>The research will interrogate the relationship between seasonal migration?a widespread life history adaptation for seasonal environments?and genetic migration?the movement of genes that underlies population differentiation. Seasonal migration has long been thought to influence dispersal and therefore gene flow, but whether long-distance seasonal migration promotes versus constrains gene flow remains poorly understood. This proposal uses a novel comparative framework coupled with population genomics to test competing hypotheses on the influence of seasonal migration on gene flow. Using whole genome sequencing, the researchers will measure intraspecific genomic differentiation across the breeding ranges of each of 32 co-distributed bird species that breed in North American boreal forest. These species vary in their winter locations and thus their migration distances?distances that will be measured by tracking individuals with light-level geolocators. The researchers will then use phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the relationship between genetic differentiation, migration distance and other key traits. The project will advance understanding of how variation in life history influences species? evolutionary trajectories of population genetic differentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to make the next generation of dynamic DNA storage, where chemical interactions can manipulate the stored information ?in memory.?

Using the inherent parallelism of chemistry, this data processing scheme will be capable of parallel, in-memory computation, eliminating the need for sequencing and synthesizing new DNA on each data update. More specifically, the award will fund the development of the theoretical foundation of SIMD-DNA computation, including strand displacement programs to simulate various data-processing algorithms, as well as the experimental demonstration of the molecular algorithms and methodology. Further, software to simulate and verify SIMD-DNA programs will be developed. Theoretical and experimental studies on strand displacement on DNA of biological origin and sequence (native DNA) will be used to understand and decrease the spurious interactions that can occur in the absence of conventional sequence design. Native DNA has the potential to improve fidelity and significantly decrease cost compared to chemically synthesized DNA.

These high-quality data will also be useful to other social scientists, and the new research methods we have developed will improve research in this area.<br/><br/>News sources for this project are: (1) Three newswire services archived in the Annotated English Gigaword file available from the Linguistic Data Consortium; and (2) local specialty newspapers archived in Proquest Ethnic Newswatch.  The main study period is 1994-2010.  This study provides novel and unique data that permit enhanced investigation of the mutual relationship of public events and news coverage.  Methodologically, this project develops important innovations in studying social movement events (and public events more broadly) using news sources.  The methods emphasize verifiability, error-correction, and the relationality of these events.  Relational databases provide rigorous links between events and the articles describing them, which both permits event data to be verified and structures the data to be consistent with theories of the interplay of events and news coverage. Consistent with theory, relational data structures are used additionally to capture the structuring of protests into specific issue clusters and the structuring of some events as complex events with subevents. These data structures permit new lines of research.  Comparison across source types permits investigation of the different narratives and collective memories they construct about this period. Special attention is paid to the small number of events that receive disproportionate coverage in news sources and thus dominate public discourses. This new high-quality public event data will inform historical studies of this under-studied period and be useful for secondary analyses by other scholars. The use of relational data structures will improve data collection protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, despite ongoing new discoveries, the physical process that makes black holes merge is still not understood. The proposed research will probe this question of origin by targeting mergers that retain eccentric orbits observable through their gravitational wave emission. The project will develop a targeted algorithm optimized to find eccentric mergers to be used during LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA?s upcoming observing runs. These research activities will provide training for graduate students in modeling and data analysis, skillsets which are in great demand and of great benefit to society. In addition, members of the group will engage in outreach activities in order to educate and inspire the public about this new field of physics and astronomy.<br/><br/>The first theme of the project is the enhancement of search sensitivity to eccentric mergers. This will be carried out using simulated eccentric gravitational waveforms and optimizing search parameters to detect these waveforms. The second theme of the project will be the characterization of this sensitivity. The reach of the search needs to be established for the full range of expected gravitational waveforms in order to enable the astrophysical interpretation of future detections. With these steps the project will help maximize the ability of the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs to elucidate the origin of newly detected black hole mergers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural gas is mostly methane. At room temperature methane remains a gas, even under pressure. This limits its usefulness as a transportation fuel. These studies will look at the fundamental reactions involved in converting methane to larger hydrocarbons that are liquids at room temperature and thus are better fuels for vehicles. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from improved catalysts as well as training graduate and undergraduate students in techniques such as laser spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Most fundamentally, students engaged in this research will assimilate skills in problem solving, experimental design, the collection and analysis of data, and in communicating their results. Professor Metz will also help to introduce eighth-grade girls to science research through the Eureka! program.<br/><br/>The research studies being conducted under this award will use a variety of techniques to characterize the reactants, intermediates and products of the reactions of transition metal ions and cluster ions with one or more methane or ethane molecules. Kinetics studies are targeted at measuring the rates of the reactions and correlating reactivity with properties of the frontier molecular orbitals of the ions. Vibrational spectroscopy will be employed to identify both reaction products and stable intermediates. Taken together, these studies are expected to contribute to enhanced fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and C-C coupling by transition metals, with the ultimate goal of improving methods for C-H/C-C bond activation in relatively unreactive principal components of natural gas streams.  Complementary ion photofragment imaging studies of metal-alkyl ions will be utilized to determine precise covalent bond strengths, measure photodissociation dynamics and to examine spin-forbidden processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, fast and accurate predictions of weather phenomena (both terrestrial and solar), ocean dynamics, and groundwater flow are vital to economic growth and stability.  These predictions typically incorporate computer simulations of mathematical models; however, to make accurate predictions, these models need to be properly ""initialized""; that is, they need to know the current state of the system very precisely and the models need to be adjusted based on actual observations of the system in question.  For example, in order to accurately predict the weather, models often require the current state of the weather to be known on the scale of a few inches, but weather observation stations are often spaced several miles apart.  Since weather is a highly chaotic phenomenon, small errors in the observations and/or sparsity in the actual observations can lead to significant errors in the predictions.  To address this issue in the past several decades a collection of techniques known as ""data assimilation"" have been developed.  Data assimilation incorporates observational data into the mathematical model of the system of interest in order to drive the prediction to the correct state.  However, the standard data assimilation techniques, known as the Kalman filter and four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) approaches, are very computationally costly, and major challenges still exist when adapting them to complex systems.  Recently, a new algorithm for data assimilation, known as the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) algorithm has emerged as a fast, robust, highly accurate technique which is easy to adapt to a wide variety of models, and which is computationally inexpensive to add to an already existing computational model.  This project will not only extend and improve the AOT algorithm, but it will also use new ideas and technologies invented by the PIs and coauthors to adapt the AOT framework to learn more about the underlying mathematical model itself, further improving predictive capabilities.  This project fosters mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, interdisciplinary research, and interaction with national labs.  The impacts of this project will be far-reaching and will pave the way for new techniques which will greatly speed up data assimilation in simulations of highly complicated fluid flows, introduce novel techniques for parameter learning and model reconstruction, and provide a computational approach to investigating fundamental mathematical problems. The computational technologies and mathematical tools developed will be useful to scientists and engineers in other fields as well.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous work of the PIs on the AOT algorithm, which showed that this algorithm can be adapted to learn the (unknown) parameters of the system, and even the form of the model itself, while simultaneously recovering the ""true"" state of the system. Extensions of the preliminary work will be carried out, and rigorous justification for convergence of the algorithm will be completed for physically interesting systems, including noisy data and sparse-in-time observations. In addition, several extensions of AOT itself will be numerically tested and rigorously investigated: nudging for intermittent observations, as well as nudging based on moving observers. AOT will also be implemented and tested for a multi-physics large-scale model of the Earth's oceans, for the Richards equation for soil moisture, and for a simplified fluids experiment using real-time collected data. This project will optimize observer requirements for better accuracy, significantly lowering costs. The methods described here have the potential to reduce production and computational cost for experiments, making them more useful to researchers working on real world problems. Moreover, novel proof methods will be developed to prove convergence in the cases of nonlinear AOT algorithms, AOT-based on moving observers, AOT-based model recovery, temperature-based AOT, and extensions of AOT to geophysical settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of the importance of such analysis, more than 100 pathway-analysis methods have been developed thus far. However, as all these methods are biased toward well-studied conditions, such as cancer diseases, the accuracy of pathway-analysis methods is severely compromised, especially when investigating non-cancer diseases and phenotypes. More importantly, existing methods are limited to the analysis of a single cohort or data type, making them sensitive to biological heterogeneity and unable to analyze complex diseases that involve multiple molecular levels. This project aims to bridge these gaps by designing an analysis pipeline that will tackle bias correction and data integration in one computational framework. This will have a great impact in many research and public health areas by facilitating the identification of putative molecular causes of disease, as well as the identification of potential therapeutic interventions and their possible side effects. This project also includes a systematic outreach program involving Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) across Nevada, especially minority- and Hispanic-serving institutions: College of Southern Nevada and Nevada State College. The applications presented here will enable students to conduct exciting scientific research without the need to perform wet-lab experiments. Other planned outreach activities involve summer workshops for K-12 local schools from Washoe County School District. <br/><br/>Most pathway-annotation databases have important limitations. Some of these limitations are related to the domain (e.g., focused on cancer alone), others to the types of data included (e.g., only expression data), and still others to the level of detail chosen to describe the phenomenon. Further, pathway-analysis methods are subject to systematic bias due to unrealistic assumptions and overfitting. Another pain point is the inability to easily include multiple cohorts and multiple types of -omics data in the same analysis. This project will provide a framework that allows researchers to retain their preferred pathway methods while correcting for method bias and integrating multiple data types and datasets. The goal of this project will be achieved by two thrusts: 1) design a methodology for bias correction and consensus analysis of pathway methods, and 2) develop a novel approach for the flexible integration of multi-cohort and multi-omics data. The framework will be designed so that it can be applied in conjunction with any existing pathway-analysis method to correct for bias, incorporate knowledge from different databases and integrate data of different types. The project also includes a systematic evaluation plan of the proposed methodologies using more than 100 datasets with known mechanisms. The research team will deliver an implementation that supports several widely used methods for many model organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The quantification of spatial correlation of qualitative marks has been a longstanding focus in spatial statistics. It is a key aspect of population forestry and ecology theory but receives little attention in biomedicine. Recent developments in deep learning and biotechnology have greatly facilitated generating massive high-dimensional genome sequence count data with spatial information. This creates an urgent need for innovation to analyze such complex data, driving the methodological modernization and theoretical developments in spatial statistics. In this project, the investigator will develop a series of computationally efficient spatial and shape methods that are theoretically sound and practically useful for addressing the heterogeneity issue commonly seen in the new geospatial data (e.g., spatial transcriptomics data). The investigator also plans to develop user-friendly and open-source software. The project will expose undergraduate and graduate students to advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematical skillsets.<br/><br/>The investigator will develop three modeling frameworks to analyze heterogeneous geospatial data at different spatial resolutions. First, an energy-based framework that characterizes heterogeneous spatial patterns for both grided and point data will be developed. Compared with the traditional kernel-based methods, the new method is more robust to noise and computationally more efficient. Towards the goal, the investigator will incorporate a novel feature selection mechanism into the framework to jointly identify multiple spatial patterns for the high-dimensional geospatial data. Then, the study will explore how to construct an interpretable low-dimensional representation of the geospatial data. In particular, the investigator will focus on integrating multi-modal geospatial data to improve the accuracy and resolution of spatial domain partition. Once the spatial domains have been segmented, an immediate task is to characterize their complex shapes. Finally, a landmark-based framework that quantifies a spatial domain?s boundary will be studied to account for heterogeneous boundary roughness. The developed methodologies will contribute to much-needed theories and applications in Bayesian spatial and shape analysis. The investigator will also study the potential benefits and shortcomings of parametric and nonparametric Bayesian methods in this context from both theoretical and computational aspects. Results will be disseminated through workshops, publications, and new courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When designing enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), it is necessary to understand the multiscale, multiphysics, thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes that impact the EGS dynamics and productivity. This project aims to gain a fundamental understanding of key mechanisms controlling the dynamics in EGS (solid displacement, fluid flow, and heat transfer) and sustainability of EGS reservoirs through numerical simulations. A novel numerical simulation framework to be built through this project will allow for designing, managing, and optimizing energy production from EGS.<br/> <br/>The THM processes in EGS can be described by Biot?s thermo-poroelasticity model, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Any desirable numerical methods for THM systems should preserve the underlying physical laws, such as mass and energy conservation, and present no numerical instabilities for a wide range of physical and simulation parameters. This project seeks to develop a unified numerical modeling framework based on adaptive enriched Galerkin (EG) methods to provide robust and physics-preserving numerical methods whose numerical analysis is feasible. The proposed EG schemes are mass conservative and free of numerical instabilities commonly present in poroelasticity and coupled flow-transport problems. The mass conservation property, stability, and convergence behaviors of the proposed methods will be studied mathematically and confirmed numerically. Moreover, residual-based a posteriori error estimators will be derived and utilized for designing dynamic mesh adaptivity techniques. The developed EG algorithms will be implemented within finite element software packages to verify the theoretical results and validate the new numerical model's capabilities to capture the EGS dynamics. The performance of the new EG methods will be compared with that of state-of-the-art numerical methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate researchers, including individuals actively recruited from groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).<br/><br/>The combination of Raman spectroscopy with single-molecule electrical measurements provides detailed information about the configuration, binding energy, mechanical strain, vibrational modes, and local effective temperature in a single molecule bound between two electrodes. This multidimensional information allows resolution of electric field, mechanical, charge transfer, and heating effects on chemical processes occurring within the molecule. This project sets out to probe the mechanisms by which two distinctive single-molecule photoswitches undergo conformational changes in an applied field. The study will provide information about how the electrical field enables bypassing orbital symmetry selection rules, and how these processes differ from photochemical switching processes. Specific objectives include i) in situ identification of electrically controlled isomerization processes in single-molecule systems from the Raman signature of a molecule bound to two electrodes; ii) improved understanding of the effects of electric field orientation and magnitude on bond reorganization and transition states during electrical isomerization processes; iii) determination of the interplay between applied field and mechanical strain on isomerization processes; and iv) disambiguation between current-driven and field-driven isomerization processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research on gendered divisions of labor largely portrays these roles as static rather than as dynamic, adaptive processes where roles and boundaries are constantly renegotiated. Today gender and the role it plays in the society occupies a substantial place in public discourse. What constitutes ?appropriate? gender roles are constantly being renegotiated, debated, and legislated in the United States. Discussions of how past societies navigated changing gendered divisions of labor contributes greatly to these current debates by providing much needed nuance and context on topics that defy simple answers. This work will be shared in a variety of media ranging from peer-reviewed literature to public talks and workshops. The work will be shared with cultural resource staff from the Pueblos who trace their ancestry to the sites explored in this study. Ultimately, the goal of this information sharing is to foster greater collaboration between local Pueblo communities and the University of New Mexico as well as incorporating more Indigenous perspectives into academic archaeology. <br/><br/>The research is being conducted on a sample of ceramic material from five sites in the Middle Rio Grande of central New Mexico (MRG). During an extended time period, diverse groups coalesced into some of the largest communities seen in the region until the industrial era. New architectural, technological, religious, and trade practices emerged to help knit these communities together during a dynamic period of change. Pottery making practices changed alongside these other developments transforming from manufacture for local consumption to surplus production for exchange. This research tests the prediction that as demand for ceramics increased, changes in the gendered division of labor were required to help meet new production needs. To accomplish this, the project analyzes fingerprint impressions found on locally produced corrugated ceramics. These frequently preserve fingerprint impressions, the complex pattern of ridges and furrows on human palmar skin, which can reliably be used for sex estimation. These fingerprint data will serve as a proxy for gender and be compared between sites, time periods, and different ceramic types. New radiometric dates will be used to build a chronological model of gendered labor divisions. The research will generate and refine new analytical methods for addressing questions of gendered labor in the past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. How genes are turned on and off is a critical aspect of life. Changes in an organism?s environment can lead to dramatic differences in how genes are turned on and off, allowing the organism to adapt and respond to different environmental stimuli. For many organisms, the mechanisms underlying a genetic response to an environmental stressor are unknown. This proposal aims to identify how a model microorganism called Thermus thermophilus control how genes are turned on and off in response to heavy metals in their environment. This project will be conducted at the large, primarily undergraduate university, Kennesaw State University, which will provide the fellow with resources and training to conduct research, as well as ample opportunity to teach and mentor the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Thermophilic organisms are commonly used as model systems in a laboratory setting, and their proteins have considerable application in biotechnology and industry. Despite their widespread use, our understanding of the fundamental biology behind many model thermophiles is limited. Thermus thermophilus HB8 contains three Ferric Uptake Regulator (FUR) gene homologs, whose gene products are severely understudied. The FUR family of proteins are transcriptional regulators that influence gene expression in response to regulatory metals. This research will identify the transcription regulatory networks for each Thermus thermophilus HB8 FUR homolog using the combinatorial approach, Restriction Endonuclease Protection, Selection, and Amplification (REPSA). Consensus DNA-binding sequences for each protein discovered experimentally through REPSA will be identified by massively parallel semiconductor sequencing and Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation software. These motifs will be mapped to the organism?s genome using Find Individual Motif Occurrences. Potentially regulated genes will be validated in vitro through DNA-binding assays and in vitro transcription, as well as in vivo through gene expression analysis in mutant Thermus thermophilus HB8 strains. Results of this work will provide a better understanding of how heavy metals influence gene expression through transcription regulatory proteins in a model extremophile. This work should also result in novel methodologies, widely applicable to transcription factor studies, that will be shared with the scientific community. Finally, this project will support the mentorship and training of several undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of microbiology and biochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research investigates the efficacy of ecological restoration through its impacts on worker behavior. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, findings from this research will be shared with governmental and non-governmental organizations, and others with the aim of improving working conditions for those actively involved in ameliorating environmental pollution and degradation.

This project will research the interaction of nanoparticles with specific cellular proteins that are important for life processes and to develop effective therapies for diseases such as cancer.  The PIs will focus on microtubules, which are hollow protein cylinders that impart structural rigidity to cells, enable motility, and serve as conduits for intracellular transport. The ability of these materials to polymerize and depolymerize affects cellular processes and has been the subject of extensive research interest over decades. Understanding how to control the disruption of these protein structures can reduce cellular structural rigidity and serve as a target for cancer therapy. Nanoparticle-mediated inhibition of tubulin polymerization has been reported briefly; however, a general mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Such knowledge can further scientific understanding and pave the way to designing novel therapies. In this project the PIs will study the influence of nanoparticles on the polymerization of microtubules (and other filaments) both from a biochemical and structural perspective. To identify and quantitatively evaluate the chemical association of the nanoparticles with tubulin during polymerization, the PIs will utilize infrared spectroscopy, machine learning tools and other biochemical techniques. In terms of analytic ability, the integrated toolkit of measurement devices, imaging, and data analysis will be a valuable resource to investigate molecular-environmental interactions that may be expanded to other biological systems. This knowledge could have widespread implications for the comprehension of nanoparticle-based novel cancer therapeutics. For educational and outreach activities, the collaborating PIs will develop an exploratory program course intended for freshman (science and non-science majors) to enhance their education through greater interaction with faculty in small classes and to learn about research in nanotechnology. The team will specifically contribute to the education of early career and underrepresented students via university-wide programs. The algorithms and data generated during this project will be used as a basis for educational activities from the high school to professional levels. <br/><br/><br/>At the core of this project's technical approach is the recognition that a complete understanding of the influence of nanoparticles on microtubules polymerization is possible by applying molecular spectroscopy and imaging. Through this project the PIs will develop best methods to use for tubulin polymerization studies with nanomaterials having various chemical and surface properties. The PIs will harness the advantages of infrared spectroscopy by using recent advances in imaging technology to develop a spatially and temporally resolved approach that illuminates molecular details of microtubules dynamics and quantitatively evaluates the role of nanoparticles in tubulin polymerization. The project includes emerging infrared measurement technology coupled to an infrared transparent, cost-effective microfluidic platform that accurately controls biochemical environments spatiotemporally. Using this platform, the PIs will investigate the biochemistry, kinetics, and structural manifest of microtubules upon association with nanoparticles of varying composition, concentration, size, and surface functionalities. The extent of polymerization will be analyzed using a fluorescence assay. Gel electrophoresis studies will be used to assess the extent of polymerization and the phosphate release pathway will be analyzed to obtain possible mechanistic insight. Microfluidics-assisted infrared imaging of the nanoparticles will be employed to study the modulated microtubules formation to reveal manifestation of a completely different array of secondary structures that may arise from the propensity of select monomer units to adhere together during polymerization. Infrared images of the nanoparticles incubated with polymerized and dried microtubules will reveal nanoparticle spectral signatures of microtubules with aggregated proteins. The main technical contribution is a high-throughput IR imaging method to study protein polymerization in the absence and presence of nanoparticles in the microfluidic continuous flow mixing device and validate the results to facilitate understanding of the nanoparticle-protein interaction. The obtained data will further be investigated with statistical and machine learning approaches. The PIs will work to ensure that the protocols developed here are available to students of all levels, giving them an opportunity to understand the fundamentals of tubulin dynamics with nanotechnology and stimulating their creativity to develop new cancer therapeutics. In addition, the students will participate in dedicated projects, learning about future career opportunities in these fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complexes between proteins and their cofactors are highly efficient at promoting reactions that are fundamental to our own metabolism.  However, their exquisite specificity precludes their widespread application for industry.  Proteins can often be engineered to enhance their catalytic repertoire for such applications.  Cofactor engineering offers a powerful alternative to protein engineering but has received little attention to date.  This project will use organic chemistry to synthesize new cofactors that, in combination with their protein scaffolds, may be applied to green chemistry and bioremediation.  The project will provide advanced training, spanning chemistry and biochemistry, and will provide students with a foundation for future contributions to enzyme optimization and application in biocatalytic process chemistry, an emerging area in sustainable chemistry.  The power of chemistry to manipulate biological systems will also be introduced into new courses associated with the creation of a biochemistry major through a collaboration between the Departments of Chemistry, Biophysics, and Biology at Johns Hopkins University.<br/>	<br/>Enzymes of the flavin-dependent nitroreductase superfamily promote a wide range of chemical transformations with promise for deployment in industrial biocatalytic processes. Still, the search for natural variants and the construction of enzyme libraries has yet to produce satisfactory candidates from the best characterized subgroups of nitroreductases and iodotyrosine deiodinases.  Under this project, research in the Rokita laboratory will instead focus on controlling specificity and chemistry by modifying the cofactors necessary to promote catalysis.  Only minor changes to the flavin structure can engender large changes in catalytic chemistry as illustrated by examples of 5-deazaflavin and 6-carboxyflavin.  The reducing power of native flavin is not sufficient to drive the full reduction of nitroaromatics to their amine products, but a nitroreductase containing 5-deazaflavin should have sufficient reducing capacity to produce the amines, for example.  In a complementary aim, the ability of 6-carboxyflavin to form a more stable semiquinone intermediate than the native cofactor will be integrated into biocatalyst development for reductive dehalogenation chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has shown that math-anxious children typically continue to experience math anxiety as they get older. People with math anxiety tend to perform more poorly in math and are less likely to take advanced math courses or pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. Thus, tackling math anxiety early on is important for mitigating negative impacts later in life. This project will develop and test a school-based intervention to decrease children?s math anxiety. Researchers have suggested that math anxiety leads to lower math achievement because it leads people to avoid math, and because anxious thoughts use the limited cognitive resources in working memory, which are required for solving math problems. Therefore, this project will test whether any reduction in math anxiety from the intervention leads children to avoid math less, have better working memory skills, and perform better in math. This project will produce intervention materials that can be used to alleviate children?s math anxiety and help to better understand long-term effects of math anxiety on math avoidance, working memory, and math achievement.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to develop the math anxiety intervention. This intervention will adapt an existing classroom-based intervention and add exposure components from cognitive behavioral therapy interventions, which are effective for children with other anxiety-related disorders. The work will involve developing a child workbook, facilitator session guides, and facilitator training materials. During this process, intervention components will be tested with 24-39 children to inform revisions to the materials. The second goal is to test the effect of the intervention on math anxiety and whether any effect leads to changes in working memory and math avoidance, and subsequently math achievement. Second- and third-grade classrooms will be randomly assigned within schools to have their students with high math anxiety (140 students total) participate in the small-group intervention or be in a business-as-usual control group (140 students total). Children?s math anxiety, avoidance, working memory, and math achievement will be assessed before and after the intervention, as well as 3 and 6 months later. Results will be used to test the theory that intervention-induced changes in math anxiety relate to increased working memory and decreased math avoidance, which relate to improved math achievement. The findings from this project will have implications for understanding the role of math anxiety in math achievement, and have the potential to lead to long-term increases in STEM workforce participation.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.

This change in faculty demographics will ultimately result in graduating more STEM students from diverse populations and increasing diversity in the STEM workforce. Enhancing diversity within the STEM workforce will contribute to mitigating systemic racism, boosting innovation in the workplace, and enhancing the economy and prosperity within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and our Nation.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. FCPAM awards are intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar institutions of higher education. FCPAM collaborators also study how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FCPAM, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance AGEP populations.<br/><br/>The foundation of this FCPAM includes a cluster hiring strategy to recruit diverse faculty who will have a shared learning experience and support system across the universities, including a joint faculty development initiative, a faculty mentorship program, common events and shared resources. In addition, the Alliance has a collaborative plan focusing on equity to examine, change, and align institutional policies and procedures in support of a welcoming and supportive academic climate for a diverse faculty. The Alliance will use formative and summative evaluations to document results and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the model throughout the life of the project. The self-study of the FCPAM development and activities will advance knowledge concerning how socio-cultural, economic, structural, and institutional variables impact the development and success of the Alliance model and the institutional culture changes. An intersectional lens will be used to examine the impact of the FCPAM activities on the success of recruited faculty in relation to their identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, immigration status or national origin, abilities, and being a caregiver or a parent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some materials this transformation is reversible, so that the material can repeatedly transform back and forth between two shapes, giving rise to the property of ?shape memory?. In a martensitic ceramic like zirconia, the shape change is very large (elongating and contracting a shape by ~10%) and it also exerts very large forces.  For this reason, shape memory materials are like ?solid-state engines?, able to do work on their surroundings as actuators. What is more, it has been recently discovered that shape memory zirconia can be transformed by applying electric fields to it, which opens the door to electronic control over shape memory. With support from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, this project investigates the new property of electrical shape memory in ceramics and develops tools to discover and design new ceramic materials that exhibit this property. The project consists of computational and theoretical efforts to understand how different parameters affect the martensitic transformation, led by Prof. Homer at Brigham Young University, and an experimental effort to validate the phase transformation theory for different orientations of the crystals, temperatures, and applied electric fields. This research to synthesize and test new prospective shape memory ceramics is carried out in Prof. Schuh?s research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This research has implications for actuator device technologies, which have not been as easily miniaturized as other electronic technologies. Additionally, the project will also provide scientific training for two PhD students, one at each institution, and outreach activities will involve a collaborative effort to strengthen the roll out of a Materials Science minor program at BYU to unify materials-oriented students that are spread across different majors on campus.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Supported by the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, this project investigates a new class of shape memory ceramics in which the classical advantages of shape memory (the ability to do large amounts of mechanical work through a solid state phase transformation) are paired with a new mechanism for activating that property (an electric field-driven paraelectric-to-paraelectric phase transformation). Besides developing an entirely new class of ?paraelectroactive? ceramics that can perform meaningful mechanical work and expanding the portfolio of electroactive ceramics, the research also has implications for the theory of phase transformations more broadly. The research involves four interrelated tasks: (1) developing and validating thermodynamic models that incorporate the coupled influence of electrical-thermal-mechanical energy on a paraelectric-to-paraelectric martensitic transformation; (2) examining the role of crystal orientation and anisotropic material properties on the predicted and observed phase transformation conditions; (3) exploring the role of dopants to control the transformation conditions and enable room temperature operation of this phenomenon; (4) expanding the materials-scope of the phenomenon by discovering alternative (non-zirconia) shape memory ceramics that exhibit paraelectric-paraelectric martensitic transformations. These tasks are collaboratively investigated with a primarily experimental effort in Prof. Schuh?s research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Prof. Homer?s research group mostly carrying out theoretical effort at Brigham Young University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, along with faculty development, the grant aims to enhance undergraduate CS and engineering teaching strategies that will lead to students? higher degree completion rates. Barriers, like financial hardships and lack of research mentorship, for low-income, first-generation, and minority students prevent them from completing baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines. Further, cultural and academic barriers can lower self-efficacy and self-identity as a scientist and engineer when they participate in research experiences. Project ACHIEVE will implement the Affinity Research Group Model from the Computing Alliance for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) through an engaging undergraduate research course, Introduction to Scientific Research Challenges. This course will offer an opportunity to participate in research experiences with faculty and graduate students in Computer Science, Computer, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering programs.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this Track 1 PPP project is to implement, evaluate, and produce preliminary knowledge on evidence-based methods to overcome significant barriers to entry and persistence among students in undergraduate engineering and computer science degree programs.

The research benefits the advancement of science associated with the formation of nanostructures through ion beam surface interactions. In this manufacturing process, the combined atom and ionized particle impingement at the surface under oblique angle of incidence is used to controllably form arrays of three-dimensional nanostructures. A wide spectrum of materials and elemental combinations can be used in this manufacturing process leading to a versatility in nanostructure formation. This process would provide a measure of control over the physical and chemical structure which currently limits the range of resulting elemental compositions, nanostructure geometries and shapes. The use of multiple of ion beams combined with selected elemental compositions and choice of kinetic properties widely extends the range of materials for nanostructure manufacturing. This research closes a gap in three-dimensional nanomaterials fabrication to achieve precise geometrical shape and elemental control. The new nanomaterials with improved shape and material composition control and precision will enable new applications, for example in photonics, energy harvesting, or biosensing. This research will benefit the economy and society of the United States through enabling new materials for device applications.

International exchange and interdisciplinary approaches support engineering workforce training and serves to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in science and education.<br/><br/>Glancing angle deposition is a versatile bottom-up technique to create three-dimensional nanostructures without the inclusion of expensive and time-consuming lithographic and etching processes. This work addresses current limitations for broad area nanostructure formation and subsequent technical use which result from structure fanning, which is the broadening of structure thickness or diameter with increasing height, lack of controlled structure arrangements across a substrate surface and insufficient control over compound compositions for relevant oxides, nitrides, and carbides. Ion processing overcomes these barriers by utilizing ion erosion for the initial substrate patterning, reactive ion-assisted growth for compound formation with precise stoichiometry and ion beam figuring to limit fanning and improve structure homogeneity. The research will investigate mechanisms which determine the influence of low-energy ion processing during glancing angle deposition using a computationally driven experimental approach. The research team will perform experiments for ion-assisted manufacturing and material modification supported by Monte Carlo based simulations to explore ion-surface driven interactions on the nanoscale. The experiments are characterized by in situ optical process control and finite element based dynamic modeling to explore the impact of ions during material fabrication in real time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the quantum materials belong to the class of quantum many-body systems, which consist of quantum particles interacting with each other. The challenge here lies in the fact that the study of quantum many-body systems is in general extremely difficult.  The proposed research tackles this challenging problem using the platform of cold atoms --- atoms isolated in vacuum chambers in the gaseous phase and cooled down to extremely low temperature such that their behavior is governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. These cold atomic systems are amenable to exquisite experimental control and their microscopic interactions are often well understood. As such, the study of cold atoms can often provide new fundamental insights into general quantum many-body systems. Therefore, the proposed research will promote the progress of science. Through student involvement in the research, this proposal will also support education and technical training in a spectrum of STEM fields. <br/><br/>More specifically, the proposed research builds upon the group's past success and involves the study of spinor quantum gases, focusing on the interplay between the spin and the charge degrees of freedom. The research is organized around three themes: study of spin-charge separation in one-dimensional spinor quantum gases; quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory and Dirac string using spinor condensates; study of multicriticality in generalized Dicke models beyond the two-level atom paradigm. To tackle these problems, a wide spectrum of analytical and numerical tools will be employed and developed. The projects addresses both long-standing challenges (for example, the detection and characterization of exotic quantum phenomena in one dimension such as spin-charge separation and spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid), and new developments (for example, developing new methods to study 1D lattice models in strong interaction limit, building a theoretical platform to systematically study multicritical phenomena).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is known as 'coarticulation'. An example is that when pronouncing the word 'bone', speakers begin the movement needed to produce the nasal 'n' sound early, during the pronunciation of the preceding 'o' vowel. What aspects of this articulatory overlap are universal across speakers and what aspects can vary across speakers? This project addresses that question by examining how speakers of American English vary in their coarticulation patterns producing the same set of words. Since coarticulation provides advance information about upcoming sounds in the word, it can be used predictively by listeners to comprehend speech more efficiently. How do listeners adapt to cross-speaker variation when using coarticulation to comprehend speech? This question is addressed by investigating how listeners track and use cross-talker coarticulatory variation during word comprehension. Finally, coarticulation has played a prominent role in explaining common historical sound changes, and this project addresses the role of coarticulatory variation in leading to historical variation across languages. This research will contribute to our basic understanding of speech and can facilitate better treatment of speech and language disorders. It will also contribute to the training and mentoring of a future generation of scientists (including undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher). <br/><br/>The project's first objective is to characterize individual differences in coarticulation using acoustic and perceptual assessments. Experiment 1 identifies talker-specific relationships between prosodic organization, nasal-coarticulatory, oral articulations, and voice quality in order to typologize the coarticulation production grammars of 100 speakers of American English. Experiment 2 perceptually defines individual variation in the grammatical specification of coarticulatory vowel nasalization produced by these speakers. The goal is to typologize cross-speaker variation using the same conventions used to define cross-linguistic coarticulatory variation, relating synchronic coarticulatory variation across individuals to cross-linguistically phonologized phonetic patterns. The prediction is that the types of variation in produced coarticulatory patterns that are seen across languages also exist systematically across individual speakers. Objective 2 is to investigate the influence of perceptual learning of talker-specific coarticulatory patterns on listener-based sound change mechanisms. Experiments 3 and 4 investigate perceptual adaptation to talker-specific patterns of coarticulation, exploring how listener adaptation to talker-specific coarticulation patterns is an integral mechanism of phonologization. The prediction is that perceptual learning of coarticulation is helpful because it allows listeners to both be flexible and predict how a given talker is going to produce a word. This mechanism can also be integrated into listener-oriented mechanisms of sound change to explain how different coarticulation patterns phonologize. The project tests novel extensions of listener-based sound change accounts that integrates perceptual adaptation to talker-specific coarticulatory patterns in order to account for how novel coarticulatory patterns phonologize.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves are ripples of warped spacetime that travel through the universe at the speed of light. They are emitted by the most cataclysmic events in the universe, such as colliding black holes and neutron stars. Today's gravitational-wave observatories have given humanity an entirely new sense to learn about the universe, but they are only sensitive enough to detect the loudest gravitational waves. The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors will reach to the edge of the observable universe and will observe the loudest gravitational waves with extremely high fidelity. This award will help scientists recover the most exciting and surprising physics from these high-fidelity observations. Specifically, this award supports a research program that uses supercomputer calculations to model gravitational waves from merging black holes. Through their participation in this project, undergraduate and master's students at California State University, Fullerton, a Hispanic-serving institution, will play important roles in gravitational-wave astronomy while learning research and computational skills that will prepare them for successful STEM careers. The PI and student researchers will integrate results from this work into a week-long workshop; the workshop will introduce students from Citrus College (a local Hispanic-serving community college) to gravitational waves, high-performance computing, and undergraduate research.<br/><br/>This award renews support for California State University, Fullerton's computational gravitational-wave research program. The PI and students at the undergraduate and master's level, working as members of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration, will play key roles in preparing for the application of numerical-relativity modeling to next-generation gravitational-wave observations. First, they will assess the accuracy and performance limits of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a state-of-the-art numerical-relativity code, to determine how well it can model future detectors' loudest observations, which will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the thousands. Second, they will explore the potential for SpECTRE, a next-generation, open-source numerical-relativity code, to model high-SNR observations of merging black holes. They will complete the first assessment of SpECTRE's accuracy, efficiency, and scaling while contributing toward enabling SpECTRE's first simulations of binary black holes. The high-accuracy model gravitational waveforms resulting from this work will help develop improved analytic approximate models necessary for inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources and for testing general relativity under the most extreme conditions. This work will also reveal the potential of next-generation techniques to model merging black holes while laying a foundation for using them to model black holes tearing apart neutron stars. High-fidelity observations of these events will reveal, with unprecedented fidelity, the behavior of the universe's densest matter and most strongly warped spacetime?but they will require model waveforms with tremendously improved accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the PI will develop theoretical tools in analyzing the statistics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large random matrices, which are the fundamental objects in data analysis. Besides data matrices, the PI will also investigate the associated matrices of large random graphs and, in applications to mathematical physics, random Schrodinger operators.

This work shows that a mean-field model like Gaussian orthogonal ensemble or Gaussian unitary ensemble can be used to model non-mean-field models?in this case, band matrices. The PI anticipates that this project will lead to a solution (in a certain weak sense) of the long standing open problem regarding the delocalization of random Schrodinger operators. Another project aims to extend the existing theory concerning Dyson?s Brownian motion to eigenvectors of free convolution models. This project can be viewed as extending Dyson?s Brownian motion to a non-uniform setting. The third project concerns investigation of the eigenvalue and eigenvector statistics of the adjacency matrices of d-regular graphs for any degree d bigger than or equal to three. A long-term goal of this project is to show that the second largest eigenvalue distributes by the Tracy-Widom law up to a shift.

As a result of pi-conjugation, these materials will become conductive when one applies a voltage (like in transistors) or shine light on them (like in photovoltaic cells). The purpose of metals in these materials is not only to control the molecular geometry, but also to tune optoelectronic properties, crystallinity and solution processable properties. The ability to solution-process these organic semiconductors will impact the printable electronic industry, providing portable devices and alternatives ways to convert solar energy to high value electricity. This project, if successful, will provide access to much needed high-performance optoelectronic materials that are low-cost and use sustainable chemistries and earth abundant elements. The research team will broaden participation of women in science through the Flora Stone Mather Center for Women Mentoring Program at Case Western University. This program pairs upper-level undergraduate students or advanced doctoral students with professionals to foster a sense of community and provide professional role models. Mentors are matched with mentees based on career interests, educational focus, and mentoring relationship expectations. To broaden participation of minority students in STEM, local high school students will be recruited through the American Chemical Society project SEED program.  This outreach activity will place economically disadvantaged students into research laboratories during the summer.  <br/><br/>This proposal will focus on the development of novel azadipyrromethene (ADP)-based complexes that have the rare combination of solution processability, excellent charge transport, absorption in the visible to NIR spectrum, and low synthetic complexity. In the first objective, difluorinated naphthyls and trifluoromethyl functionalization of non-planar zinc(II) complexes of ADP will be explored to further the understanding of how the dipole moment strength and direction effects self-assembly. This will also establish generalized guidelines to improve charge transport in non-planar systems. Organic photovoltaic efficiency will be increased by optimizing the polymer donor.  Planar aza-BODIPY ligands as well as N2O2-type ADP ligands coordinated with group IV elements will also be researched. The second objective will focus on the synthesis and studies of novel NIR semiconductors based on aza-BODIPY ligands by extending pi-conjugation using noncovalent conformational locks. This research will provide fundamental structure-property relationships that have the potential to transform the field of pi-conjugated molecules and polymers, dyes with visible NIR absorption, ADP chemistry, and organic electronics. The findings could also impact applications including NIR photodetectors and sensors, bioimaging, solar energy conversion and photocatalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boolean functions are central to many branches of computer science, including the study of machine-learning algorithms (where a major goal is to efficiently infer Boolean functions based on their input-output performance) as well as hyperefficient ""property testing"" algorithms that inspect only a tiny portion of a massive data set in order to estimate some global property of the data. In a parallel, but to-date largely disconnected, line of research, mathematicians have expended great effort towards understanding structural properties of various types of geometric sets in high-dimensional continuous space. Such sets can also be viewed as ""decision rules"", but ones that amalgamate a list of continuous numerical values, rather than discrete yes/no answers, in order to produce a yes/no value (which indicates whether or not the input point described by the numerical values belongs to the set). Viewed from this very high-level perspective these two lines of research have similar broad goals, but the techniques they use are quite different, and the two fields have mostly considered distinct types of questions and mathematical objects.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators will work to establish and deepen connections between the two settings --- discrete and continuous --- described above. The driving force behind this project is an analogy, developed by the investigators in a sequence of recent works, between Boolean functions that are monotone non-decreasing and high-dimensional sets that are convex. This perspective has already led to a number of surprising new results and suggests a broad range of new notions and questions as well as methods of proof. Building on their preliminary work, the investigators will work to establish new structural results for high-dimensional geometric sets (focusing in particular on convex sets in continuous high-dimensional spaces that are endowed with the Gaussian distribution) that are inspired by analogous structural results that have been established in concrete complexity for Boolean functions.  As mentioned above, the structural results obtained to date in concrete complexity for discrete domains have proved very useful for computer science applications such as computational learning, property testing, and derandomization; the investigators will work to establish similar applications in learning, testing, and derandomization in the continuous setting. The investigators will also develop the connection between the discrete and continuous settings in the other direction, by working to apply some of the powerful methods of high-dimensional convex geometry to obtain new structural and algorithmic results in the discrete Boolean setting. Finally, another important goal of the project is to train graduate students through the process of research collaboration and dissemination, with a particular goal of building expertise that spans both the topics of high-dimensional convex geometry and discrete Boolean concrete complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A popular example of such a material is stacked sheets of hexagonal carbon graphene.  The aim is to develop flexibility in design from the multitude of ways in which the layers can be placed relative to each other to achieve a desired interaction of optical and electromagnetic waves, ultimately delivering practical options for harnessing light.  The layering process naturally intertwines the geometrical structure of the layers with the mathematical equations for the underlying physics. This project focuses on the interaction of these mathematical objects with the intent of building a foundational theory of layered media. Because the investigation targets the underlying physical phenomena, its results will be applicable across the diverse aspects of society that rely on electromagnetic devices.   Students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will be integrated into a dedicated group of researchers from diverse backgrounds and will be given the opportunity to present their work at scientific conferences to help them broaden their scientific horizons and forge professional connections.<br/><br/>There is a physical and mathematical object that lies at the center of the investigations in this project, called the Fermi surface, which together with the associated Bloch surface contains core information about electromagnetic waves in crystalline or periodic materials, by encoding a relation between two fundamental physical quantities, energy (or frequency) and momentum (or wavenumber).  These objects are analytic or algebraic varieties, depending on the details of the periodic medium, and their structure encodes information about the layering method.  The layered materials can be either two-dimensional, such as multi-layer graphene sheets, or three-dimensional, where the layers are internal to the bulk and provide a sort of hidden degree of freedom.  Specific objectives are to establish connections between the layering method and the Fermi and Bloch varieties, particularly their reducibility and singularities; to analyze the resonant consequences of reducibility of these varieties; to classify internal symmetries that result in reducibility and the persistence of reducibility under symmetry breaking; to create novel bulk media by homogenization of layered graph models; and to apply these investigations to multi-layer graphene and other physically viable layered materials.

The results of these studies will further the development of thioamides as tools for biophysical and medicinal chemistry by providing rules for the rational design of thioamide proteins with or without affecting stability, as desired.  The work will also help to explain the evolutionary value of the thioamides found in certain natural proteins.  The planned investigations of the fundamental properties of thioamides can impact areas as diverse as epigenetics, the biophysics of protein folding, the design of enzyme inhibitors, or even fluorescence-guided surgery using thioamide-stabilized peptides as tumor imaging agents.  The broader impacts of this work include training undergraduate and graduate students in a multidisciplinary laboratory environment that makes use of organic synthesis and physical chemistry, as well as molecular and cellular biology, to investigate biological phenomena.  In addition, Professor Petersson and his research group will participate in expositions both in-person, and virtual, to demonstrate their findings to K-12 groups and interested adults.  They will also help to build the Penn Chemistry Summer Research Academy so that more students from groups under-represented in science have opportunities to experience science and participate in scientific research.<br/><br/>Under this project, the physical properties and reactivity of thioamides will be studied as a function of amino acid sequence in model peptides.  This will aid in the mechanistic understanding of environment-dependent properties such as pKa, and in benchmarking quantum mechanical (QM) calculations.  For example, there is a need to better develop in molecular mechanics parameters for tripeptides or polypeptides, rather than use parameters based on small molecule values as has been done heretofore.  Reactivity studies will be performed that have the potential to develop tools to identify new natural thioamide-containing proteins.  Professor Petersson?s laboratory will also study thioamide effects on the secondary and tertiary structure of peptides, peptide/protein host-guest systems, and full-length proteins.  Using data from model systems, novel PyRosetta programs will be developed in an effort to predict the effects of thioamides on protein stability.  These predictions will be tested on thioamide-containing proteins, which will be characterized through X-ray crystallography and/or NMR as well as solution-phase stability measurements.  Taken together, these experiments are expected to provide a better systematic understanding of the effects of thioamides on protein properties from local sequence-based effects, to effects on secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Stressors such as high temperature, drought, and salt can lead to reduced crop yields and billions of dollars of crop loss each year. To feed a growing global population, innovative new agricultural methods must be developed to improve plant stress tolerance and crop yield. One emerging method to meet these goals and increase crop performance in a warming climate is through design and application of climate-selected microbial communities; however, we currently have little basic understanding of how existing microbial communities (microbiomes) influence plant performance at elevated temperature. Through this proposed research, the fellow will investigate how microbial communities change inside or on the surface of a plant at elevated temperature, and the impact those changes have on plant health. In parallel, the fellow will work to improve food security through the Campus Pantry Collaborative (CPC). The CPC provides a direct outlet to share scientific findings from this project with a non-scientific audience and an opportunity to bridge the gap between social and scientific efforts to improve food security.<br/><br/>This project combines molecular, multi-omic, and mathematic modeling approaches to address knowledge gaps in ?temperature-microbiome-plant? triangular interactions and reveal underlying principles of emergent plant and microbiome function(s) in warming conditions. Previous research suggests that microbiomes can perform specific functions in defined abiotic conditions. Separate findings show that plant physiology, development, and phenotype can be dramatically influenced by abiotic factors, such as elevated temperature. By simultaneously examining changes in microbial composition and plant performance at elevated temperature this project has the potential to reveal new principles of host-microbiome-environment interactions that could apply even beyond plant systems. Additionally, this research will be used to improve current predictive models for microbiome changes that can be directly tested in crop species. Through this project, the fellow will develop a multidisciplinary research skill set and will gain additional skills in scientific mentoring and lab management.

The equations in both settings are elliptic equations that describe steady-state problems in science and engineering, and a priori information on the underlying problems is included in the form of inequality constraints.  The numerical schemes are based on finite element methods, one of the leading methodologies in computational engineering and science.

The second class is concerned with solving fully nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems with convexity constraints on the solutions. For the elliptic optimal control problems, novel finite element methods will be developed for problems with general cost functions that include point tracking problems for the state as a special case, problems with constraints on the gradient of the state, and problems constrained by elliptic equations with rough coefficients. For the fully nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems, finite element methods for their classical solutions will be investigated.  They include equations of the Monge-Ampere type where the convexity of the solutions plays a key role, such as the first and second boundary value problems for the Monge-Ampere equations in two and three dimensions, and the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the prescribed Gaussian curvature equation in two dimensions.

Macroalgae range in form from >30-m high giant kelp to mm-scale filamentous turfs. They shape aquatic ecosystems worldwide, providing food and habitat to legions of species including many important to coastal fisheries and recreation. At the same time, the diversity of macroalgal species and forms makes it challenging to understand the processes affecting their abundance and distribution. Past efforts to define functional groups based on gross morphology ? for example, finely branching vs. large-bladed or erect vs. prostrate - have had some success in interpreting ecological patterns, yet key information is lost and quantitative tests of predictions often fail with such broad groupings. Alternatively, trait-based modeling is a promising approach to incorporate more complexity and define relationships between quantifiable characteristics, such as blade mass per area, and the distribution and abundance of species. This project combines field, laboratory, and modeling components to measure macroalgal traits and validate models of species distribution in the coastal ocean. The outcome will be a framework for macroalgal communities that can be used to predict how the distribution of groups and species change across space and time. The project will provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in field and laboratory research. Educational outreach efforts will leverage collaboration with the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project to reach K-12 students and teachers, including urban Los Angeles. Other outreach includes interaction with the media, the Santa Barbara Sea Center, and agencies such as the Santa Barbara Channel National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park. <br/><br/>Community ecology is often mired in case histories explaining distribution and abundance of select species, yet we need a more holistic understanding of the forces driving marine ecosystems to predict change due to climate and human impacts. In temperate marine ecosystems, macroalgae serve as the base of food webs and provide habitat, but we lack a framework for understanding macroalgal ecology beyond decades-old gross morphological generalizations. Trait-based modeling is a promising approach to incorporate complexity and define relationships between quantifiable traits and the distribution and abundance of species. The investigators are combining field and laboratory measurements with modeling to assess how well the depth distribution of common macroalgal species in southern California is predictable based on measured functional traits. The project objectives include: 1) define and measure key functional traits within and across key species of macroalgae; 2) create a trait-based simulation model for the assemblage of nearshore macroalgal communities as a function of depth; 3) test the model?s predictions by quantifying the depth distribution of macroalgal species, grazers, and environmental parameters in the Santa Barbara Channel; and 4) use individual-based models to test mechanistic hypotheses for interspecific competition. The investigators are accomplishing the first objective by measuring a suite of functional traits related to performance at multiple sites (and depths) for at least 20 species of common macroalgae in the Santa Barbara Channel, including mass-specific photosynthetic rate, nitrogen uptake rate, specific blade area, canopy height, crown area, blade thickness, mechanical and material properties, lifespan, and grazing resistance. For objective 2 the investigators are creating an ecosystem model that represents a large number of potentially viable macroalgal ?species? with stochastically determined physiological characteristics. Initialized species will interact with one another and their environment, evolving into an ecosystem where community structure and diversity are not imposed, but are emergent properties. The third objective involves an extensive field program to quantify the distribution of all identifiable macroalgal species across a depth gradient from 0 m to the terminus of hard substrate (up to 40m depth) at six sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. Physical properties (light, temperature, wave forces) are also measured along each cross-depth transect. In the fourth objective, the investigators are using results to improve their model, adding interspecific competition in an individual-based framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The processes being explored lie on the borderline between well-defined reaction classes that are typically considered to be separate from one another and which operate according to different principles. A central goal of the project is to learn more about these ambiguous and little explored transformations by investigating the reactivity of molecules specially designed to exhibit behavior at the ""edges"" of an accepted paradigm. Beyond the theoretical advances anticipated from the research, which combine insights gained from both experimental and computational chemistry, the work is expected to provide new practical approaches for the synthesis of complex molecules containing multiple rings and that possess well-defined three-dimensional structures. Such compounds are of potential utility as precursors to new pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and other advanced chemical materials of value to society. The broader impacts of this award will extend to the benefits to chemical education accrued as Professor Frontier continues to develop and maintain the innovative ""Not Voodoo"" website that she created in 2004. The site, which is now complemented by useful social media-based outreach, is designed to help practitioners of synthetic organic chemistry to demystify laboratory techniques and procedures. It serves hundreds of experimentalists each day, from students just beginning their independent research, to more advanced scientists looking for tips or tricks. ""Not Voodoo"" also plays a valuable role in promoting chemical safety.<br/><br/>This research in the Frontier group at the University of Rochester will focus on the development of three new synthetic methods, each involving an underdeveloped reaction type that occurs by an ill-defined mechanistic pathway at the edges of known electrocyclic chemistry. In Project 1, the scope of an ambiguous type of pentannulation, the ""iso-Nazarov"" cyclization, is being expanded upon and the electrocyclic vs. ionic nature of these borderline reactions interrogated by a combination of experimental and computational techniques.  In Project 2, the boundaries of electrocyclic reactivity are being extended to previously unknown higher-order cationic electrocyclizations (e.g., 6 pi-election processes leading to 7-membered rings) by studies of carefully designed unsaturated substrates. Finally, Project 3 has as its aim the discovery of a route, or a bridge, allowing efficient passage from radical to electrocyclic chemistry. Herein, a 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer-based radical-polar crossover strategy is being explored as a means to generate both cationic and anionic intermediates, thereby potentially accessing electrocyclic chemistry in a novel way. All three projects are anticipated to lead to significant new methods for the synthesis of unusual polycycles, including examples containing cycloheptane rings, spirocyclic motifs, and nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles. Improvements to the Not Voodoo website are also underway, including: (1) addition of chemical information resources; (2) introduction of new chemical safety content using information collected from the Chemical Safety Library; (3) site maintenance, which evolves continuously with user input; and (4) expanding the scope of the practical technical content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wilson of Cornell University is developing new tools to study the role of the gas hydrogen sulfide in biological settings and human health. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a small gaseous molecule, sometimes referred to as a gasotransmitter, that is biosynthesized and plays an important role in regulating a number of processes associated with normal and healthy cellular function. Because hydrogen sulfide is a gas, its controlled delivery to biological systems, in vivo, is challenging. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how this gaseous signaling molecule operates in livings systems is of great interest. This project will develop new chemical tools that can deliver small, biologically relevant amounts of hydrogen sulfide to cells upon activation by selective stimulation. If successful, these tools will enable researchers to probe the biological relevance and importance of H2S in human health. In addition, this project will develop new educational activities for high school STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) teachers. These activities will be designed to highlight how compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, that can be toxic, may be present in ?natural? or ?organic? foods at sufficiently low concentrations that do not present a health hazard. Rather, this compound has a critically important role in human biology and these activities will be designed to educate the public about the fascinating roles of gasotransmitters that are so critical to heathly human biology. <br/><br/>The Wilson research group at Cornell University will design new ruthenium-based hydrogen sulfide-releasing molecules as chemical tools to study the biological roles of the gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Hydrogen sulfide regulates a wide range of critical biological processes in eukaryotic cells and is known to elicit therapeutic effects for the management of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The direct administration of H2S to biological systems, however, is limited by its gaseous nature and toxicity at high concentrations. To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed easily handled compounds that slowly release this gasotransmitter to study its biological function. These efforts have been focused on organic compounds that are designed to release hydrogen sulfide via uncontrolled hydrolysis, blue or ultraviolet light irradiation, oxidation by reactive oxygen species, enzymatic activity, and reactions with thiols. The objective of this project is to expand the toolkit of hydrogen sulfide-releasing molecules by developing compounds based on the transition metal ruthenium. By using ruthenium coordination complexes, the Wilson team aims to gain access to hydrogen sulfide-releasing agents that are selectively activated by stimuli that are inaccessible with conventional organic compounds. Through these efforts, the redox chemistry and photochemistry of ruthenium coordination compounds will be leveraged to make hydrogen sulfide donors that are triggered by chemical reduction and light irradiation, respectively. Lastly, the Wilson group will use these new tools to understand the mechanisms by which hydrogen sulfide can protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in vitro. Collectively, this research will expand the toolkit of available hydrogen sulfide donors and will demonstrate their value by applying them to identify new roles for this gasotransmitter in healthy human biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model?s (FCPAM) goal is to develop, implement, evaluate and institutionalize a FCPAM for transforming institutions to be more supportive and culturally sensitive such that the faculty successfully advance through recruitment and retention along early career pathways to tenure in teaching intensive comprehensive universities. This FCPAM is improving the success of early-career faculty such that faculty demographics will mirror student demographics at the three collaborating institutions. This change in faculty demographics will ultimately result in graduating more STEM students from diverse populations and increasing diversity in the STEM workforce. Enhancing diversity within the STEM workforce will contribute to mitigating systemic racism, boosting innovation in the workplace, and enhancing the economy and prosperity within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and our Nation.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. FCPAM awards are intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar institutions of higher education. FCPAM collaborators also study how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FCPAM, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance AGEP populations.<br/><br/>The foundation of this FCPAM includes a cluster hiring strategy to recruit diverse faculty who will have a shared learning experience and support system across the universities, including a joint faculty development initiative, a faculty mentorship program, common events and shared resources. In addition, the Alliance has a collaborative plan focusing on equity to examine, change, and align institutional policies and procedures in support of a welcoming and supportive academic climate for a diverse faculty. The Alliance will use formative and summative evaluations to document results and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the model throughout the life of the project. The self-study of the FCPAM development and activities will advance knowledge concerning how socio-cultural, economic, structural, and institutional variables impact the development and success of the Alliance model and the institutional culture changes. An intersectional lens will be used to examine the impact of the FCPAM activities on the success of recruited faculty in relation to their identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, immigration status or national origin, abilities, and being a caregiver or a parent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ease of synthesis of the proposed tools, coupled with the ability to employ computational studies to tune their complementary (bioorthogonal) reactivity, are attractive features of this new class of compounds. The utility of these tools will be harnessed to develop selective, targeted molecular delivery methods and to tag single-chain antibody fragments capable of permeating the blood-brain barrier. All findings will be made widely available to the broader scientific community to stimulate collaborations that advance and increase the impact of the proposed work. Elements of this research program will be incorporated into multi-course laboratory modules that span analytical, organic and computational chemistry and chemical biology to increase student understanding and appreciation for tackling scientific problems that require multidisciplinary approaches. The Schomaker Lab will partner with UW-Madison Chemistry Opportunities (CHOPs), a program committed to enhancing  graduate student diversity. CHOPs participants will tour research facilities, meet with faculty/students and learn about opportunities for interdisciplinary research at UW.<br/><br/>The importance of elucidating details of the function, dynamics, and interdependence of complex biological processes drives the design of innovative new tools to study the behavior of cellular systems. Designed reagents used to probe biological systems must be highly stable, biocompatible, chemoselective, and non-promiscuous, i.e. devoid of the propensity for non-specific labeling. Due to these constraints, studying processes occurring inside cells is challenging, especially when interrogating multiple biomolecules simultaneously in real time. Despite the breadth of current bioorthogonal probes, most are designed to examine a single biological event and often suffer from slow rates, poor chemoselectivity/off-target reactivities, instability or ineffective uptake that limits labeling to a cell surface. This work introduces a new class of heterocyclic alkynes, termed ?SNO-OCTs?, where the polarizability of the alkyne is predictably tuned for mutually exclusive bioorthogonality with diverse ?click? partners. These powerful tools have the potential to allow for the observation of multiple simultaneous or sequential signaling events in vitro and in vivo. Their kinetics, bioorthogonality and physical properties should be molecularly tunable, allowing them to be potentially tailored for specific applications. Moreover, the versatility and modularity of SNO-OCT scaffolds is to be exploited to develop ?click-and-release? strategies to deliver small molecules, fluorescent probes and biomolecules to specific sites. Potential applications for these new tools include controlled protein activation, fluorophore activation to detect RNA and other biomolecules via imaging and release of gasotransmitters or drugs to targeted locations. SNO-OCT-based tools for the preparation, bioorthogonal labeling and observation of single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are to be developed. The lack of competing reactivity of SNO-OCTs with sulfur nucleophiles in the biological milieu enables efficient simultaneous functionalization of scFv from yeast surfaces and avoids the traditional need for soluble protein expression and purification. The SNO-OCT ring can be opened with nucleophiles subsequent to the labeling/imaging event to ?rewrite? the scFv for further functionalization and analysis. The Wisconsin research team plans to make these probes available to the broader scientific community to broaden their scientific reach and impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mycelium is massively produced during mushroom growth as the main body of fungi. It plays an essential role in altering soil chemistry and mechanics, enabling a suitable living environment for different plant species. Their growth naturally forms entanglement and bonds to integrate organic wastes, including hardwood residue, mill dust, and stalk, to produce strong and lightweight composites without adding synthetic glues or energy input. The multiscale structure of mycelium composites includes the chemistry of mycelium fiber, the mycelium-debris interface, and the complex mycelium network entangled with debris. These features synergistically determine the composite strength, elasticity, and toughness. This research project will develop computational modeling, culturing, and characterizations capabilities to understand the evolving mycelium structure in growth and the structure-mechanics relationship to yield better composites. This research will be complemented by establishing an inclusive, engaging, and inspiring educational program to the broad community, including curriculum development, giving a special exhibition on biomaterials, coordinating learn-by-play activities and seminars on computational simulations for bridge competition in a local museum, and involving K-12 in research through an institutional STEM education center. <br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to develop a fundamental multiscale model of mycelium-based composites, validate the model through in-lab culturing and mechanical/structural characterizations, and reveal the mechanism of making mycelium composite lightweight and strong. The research objectives of this project include (i) development of a multiscale modeling and simulations platform for the structure-mechanics relationship of mycelium-wood composite; (ii) development of Monte Carlo and generative adversarial network models to replicate and predict the growth of mycelium network; (iii) capability to use machine learning model for fast prediction of the composite mechanical properties and their scaling law with material density. In addition, the following fundamental questions will be addressed: (1) what are the roles of environmental factors and nutrition distribution in the structure and mechanics of a mycelium network; (2) what are the roles of processing parameters in the mechanics of mycelium composites. The overall focus will be on understanding the physics of mycelium composite and the potential of producing multifunctional composites from wastes.

As it is extremely costly to develop a brand new OS, a large number of downstream OS kernels are derived from an upstream OS kernel (e.g., Linux) to save development costs. However, this also means that the security of the downstream kernels are dependent on timely patch propagation from the upstream to downstream. The diversity and decentralized nature of downstreams causes delays or even missed upstream patches altogether. Even worse, due to customizations in the downstreams, it is time-consuming to infer which bugs are applicable to downstream and worth patching. Finally, even if they know an upstream vulnerability exists in a downstream and a patch is available, it may require additional efforts to port and test upstream patches --- a significant hurdle for many downstream vendors who are wary of breaking things.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a series of automated and novel analyses to reason about patches, bug behaviors, and their impacts. More specifically, the project will include an analysis of upstream patches and infer which ones fix critical bugs; it will automatically infer which downstreams are affected by an upstream bug and what security impact it bears; it will understand whether the corresponding upstream patch can be applied safely and correctly. The results of the project will alleviate the human burden in analyzing, reviewing, and adopting patches.

The new methods combine Carleman estimates, the contraction mapping principle, and an algebraic formula to retrieve the lost phase when needed. The use of the contraction mapping principle will guarantee key strengths of the new approach: relaxed requirements on the initial guesses and inexpensive computational cost.

These acute events create a complex, high-stress environment that requires teams of healthcare professionals to act precisely and quickly to give patients the best chance of survival.  The need for knowledge about how to better prepare teams for work in fast-paced, acute care settings is more important than ever. Healthcare professionals need frequent, realistic training opportunities that offer meaningful feedback on the skills that are essential for quality team-based clinical care. The research team has developed a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) platform for Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation. This platform is designed to create realistic time pressure and rapid workload changes for the training of healthcare professionals. However, existing healthcare simulation training, including VR and manikin?based learning, requires constant and real-time human observation. This limitation results in learners receiving feedback that is of variable quality - often generalized, inconsistent, and highly dependent on simulation instructors. With feedback being essential for learning and development, this limits the effectiveness and scalability of simulation training. To fill this gap, the research team will develop and evaluate a novel debriefing system that aims to capture and visualize multimodal data streams that evaluate learners? cognitive (e.g., clinical decision-making) and behavioral (e.g., situational awareness, communication) processes to provide data-informed feedback focused on improving team-based care of patients who suffer sudden medical emergencies. <br/><br/>Through this new multimodal debriefing system, instructors will be able to provide new insights and personalized feedback to clinicians during post-simulation debriefing sessions to allow for more meaningful reflection, targeted intervention, and rapid development of these complex skills. The project objectives are to: 1) conduct a human-centered design study with trainees and faculty to refine the concept of a multimodal debriefing system 2) engineer and evolve an unobtrusive multi-modal sensor-based data collection system; and 3) conduct a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the potential of this study?s debriefing system to improve clinical knowledge and teamwork skills. The proposed research not only provides a strong path forward to impact the way cardiac arrest training is carried out across institutions, but it will also create knowledge and systems that can be translated to develop data-informed, team-based training programs for other medical domains and other high-risk industries that rely on expert teams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The microbiome interacts with the animal?s immune system in complex ways. How an animal has both a highly effective immune system, but also a highly diverse microbiome that potentially contains pathogens, is achieved through adaptive immunity that has variable responses to detected threats. One job of the immune system is to monitor the microbes in an animal?s gut and to stop potential pathogens from crossing over into the blood by tagging them with immunoglobulin A (IgA). This proposal will optimize a procedure developed in humans, called ?IgA-Seq?, for application to birds. IgA-Seq sorts a microbiome into two populations, based on whether or not each individual microbe has been tagged with IgA (by the host). The separate populations can then be sequenced and analyzed, to determine who the host sees as a potential threat and what genes those potential threats have. Completing this research will provide a view of the microbiome from the lens of the host?s immune system. This research has implications for multiple fields of study and, once optimized, will be a non-lethal and novel link between the immune system and the microbiome, for use in wild animal studies. To promote future research, the researchers will create video tutorials of the entire process. To promote future generations of research, the researchers will facilitate observations of the field work and handling of wild birds by local elementary aged children. <br/><br/>The gastrointestinal epithelium is especially vulnerable to microbial infection, because vertebrates bring microbes into their digestive tract on food and the process of digestion occurs in a protected and nourishing environment. Vertebrates have gut-associated lymphoid tissue and immunological mechanisms that monitor and manage the gut microbiome, such as coating a potential pathogen with Immunoglobulin A. Whether a microbe is tagged with IgA is not random and minimizes specific threats to the host without causing a systemic immune response or inflammation, which can be costly to produce. Therefore, we can use IgA to better understand the ecology and evolution of the vertebrate microbiome because it signifies how the host views and curates its microbiome to maximize host fitness. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that the interaction between the host?s immune system (via IgA) and the commensal gut microbiome is a central regulator of host-microbiome dynamics and key to understanding the evolution of the microbiome as a trait of the host. To address this hypothesis, we propose one initial research aim: optimize the method IgA-Seq, developed in humans, that sorts a microbiome cell-by-cell into populations based on whether an IgA is attached. Using unsorted, IgA positive (IgA+) and IgA negative (IgA-) cell populations will identify the ?core? microbiome and quantify persistence of microbial taxa and functions within and across individuals and species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, it is not known which of these systems have a rigidly algebraic description (can be constructed from groups). The project aims at studying the connections of hyperbolic dynamical systems with group theory, the theory of automata, and other branches of algebra. Conversely, the project plans to use the insights gained from the study of hyperbolic systems to solve open questions in group theory.  The project also includes training and advising of students, organization of an annual high school mathematics competition, and the completion of a graduate textbook on groups and topological dynamics.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic dynamical systems are classical and well-studied examples of chaotic dynamics. However, several basic open questions remain open. One such question is whether every hyperbolic homeomorphism of a locally connected compact space comes from a nilpotent Lie group. The question is probably very hard, but the project outlines several directions toward clarifying group-theoretic aspects. The project aims to study automatic structures associated with hyperbolic systems and groups generated by such automatic structures.

Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous cofactors present in all animal kingdoms. Organisms have evolved to exploit the inherent reactivity of Fe-S clusters with small molecules like O2 and NO to assess their  environment. For example, bacteria sense environmental O2 and NO and adjust their gene expression profiles for survival using regulatory proteins that contain Fe-S clusters. The human Fe-S mitoNEET protein acts as a redox sensor and regulates mitochondrial functions, failure of which leads to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed study will offer molecular insights into the modification and repair of iron-sulfur clusters by small redox signaling molecules. Molecular insights gained in this project will inform research focused on the development of biomarkers for disease detection, of antimicrobial agents, and of therapeutics for metabolic diseases. Students who will implement the research will gain knowledge, expertise and skills in chemical synthesis, reactivity, structural characterization of molecules, and spectroscopy. This project is also integrated into an outreach program focused on the improvement of the educational environments of students from groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and students from public high schools. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to understand strategies used by Fe-S regulatory proteins to battle oxidative and nitrosative stress at the molecular level.  This goal is achieved by studying the geometric and electronic structure, reactivity, and bonding properties of discrete biomimetic, model Fe-S complexes. The chemical reactivity of Fe-S clusters will be studied in three different areas. Firstly, mechanistic details for the reactions of 4Fe-4S clusters with NO will be examined. These include the characterization of novel iron nitrosyl products and investigations on how reactive sulfur species are generated through the action of NO upon Fe-S clusters. Secondly, mitoNEET model clusters will be synthesized and  bonding properties of the Fe-S cluster will be correlated to cluster transfer activity. Lastly, persulfide-ligated Fe-S clusters will be synthesized used to study the role of persulfides in the Fe-S repair process.  Overall then, these fundamental mechanistic and spectroscopic studies have real promise to enhance understanding of Fe-S complexes in biology, in general, and their specific roles in electron transfer-initiated processes including interactions with signaling molecules such as NO and persulfides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Integration of fluidic logic in textiles represents an important step toward fully soft, untethered wearable assistive robots capable of improving quality of life for the 85 million adults in the United States living with physical functional limitations. Existing soft fluidic actuators for motion assistance and rehabilitation currently rely on hard valves and bulky electronic control systems which increase system weight and decrease comfort or require cumbersome tethers to external infrastructure, limiting adoption of these technologies. Textile-based fluidic computers will overcome this limitation, allowing onboard memory, decision making, and interaction with the environment, and leading to truly soft wearable assistive robots that look and feel like everyday clothing. An integrated educational plan focused on teaching, outreach, and mentoring will allow simultaneous development of impactful and innovative technology and promotion of the next generation of leaders in STEM. Planned activities include the use of hands-on fluid logic components in a local museum outreach and undergraduate curriculum that will be disseminated online, and longitudinal mentoring of high school and undergraduate students, with focus on underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To develop a textile-based platform for fluidic computation, a stepwise approach is taken. First, a deep fundamental understanding will be developed at the circuit element level by designing and characterizing textile-based fluidic analogs to resistors, capacitors, and relays. These circuit elements will be used as building blocks for fluidic digital logic, which will be engineered for high performance in terms of speed and other computational metrics. Finally, fluidic computers constructed from digital logic elements will be integrated directly into the structure of wearable assistive robots along with textile-based input/output devices and actuators. By default, all designs will be composite in nature, with performance dependent upon material choices and active element geometries. Design and experimental characterization will be significantly aided with physical modeling, including analytical nonlinear models of fluid flow. Validated models of circuit elements as well as logic circuits will be one of the research outcomes. Scalability of design and repeatability of fabrication will be key factors in the evaluation of success at all levels.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their interlocked structure, these materials combine flexibility with mechanical strength. Similarly interlocked structures, consisting of two or more intertwined rings, can also be produced on a molecular level by chemical synthesis, where each ring consists of only one single molecule, known as polymer or macrocycle. In the past, the synthesis of these so-called catenanes and polycatenanes has been limited to short chains and low yields. Recent advances in synthesis, however, are pushing the limits of polycatenane synthesis to new levels of complexity and reproducibility, opening a door toward using polycatenanes in nano-scale applications such as molecular motors, programmable electronic switches, and actuators. Because polycatenanes represent a new type of polymer-based architecture, basic understanding of their material properties remains limited.<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education aimed at advancing the fundamental understanding of how catenanes and polycatenanes behave in solution and at interfaces. The principal investigator is using state-of-the-art computer simulation methods and machine learning techniques to design and optimize models for interlocked polymeric architectures and use them to elucidate the material properties of polycatenanes in specific applications. This research extends the current frontier of mesoscale and multiscale modeling as a method of informing the design of nanoscale molecular assemblies.

Catenanes, together with the more complex polycatenanes, represent mechanically interlocked polymeric structures that are held together by mechanical bonds, not by covalent bonds that usually determine the properties of polymers. The PI will employ molecular simulation techniques based on a bead-spring coarse-grained model to investigate and rationalize the material properties of catenanes in solution and at interfaces. Specific projects target the translocation of catenated polymers through narrow pores, the tension distribution in catenated polymer brushes, and the development of machine learning-guided mesoscale models for catenanes. This research provides groundwork for including catenanes into the mesoscale and multiscale modeling of polymeric architectures and thus extends the current frontier of simulating complex supramolecular assemblies.

Nanoparticles are typically produced with a focus on the activity of the metals, but peptides on the surface could provide new functions. This is a challenging problem as these molecules must bind to the nanoparticle surface which can cause both the metal atoms and peptides to lose their activity. Professors Knecht, Frenkel, and their students are using bio-inspired design to tackle this challenge and use peptides that can bind nanoparticles and still present unique chemical activities. Their discoveries could lead to new methods to prepare multifunctional materials where the properties of the molecules on the particle surface can work in concert with those of the metal. In addition, this research is the basis of educational modules using nanotechnology and catalysis to engage with Miami-Dade County School students in a multi-generational model from middle to high school.<br/><br/>The transformational properties of inorganic nanomaterials focus almost exclusively on the inorganic core where the ligand shell is typically limited to controlling stability and solubility. While these are two key factors in nanoparticle structure-property relationships, a great expansion of properties could be achieved by engendering the ligand shell with additional functionalities that work synergistically with the inorganic component to achieve a multifunctional platform. Professors Knecht and Frenkel hypothesize that multidomain peptides can be designed to generate functional nanoparticle ligand interfaces that operate synergistically with the inorganic core. Such peptides are being designed with materials binding domains and a second functional domain presented to solution. In this arrangement, the properties of the functional domain of the peptide are being tuned to operate in tandem with the properties of the nanoparticle inorganic core, resulting in a multifunctional platform. Catalytic processes and advanced spectroscopic methods are being used to monitor these properties and functions of the newly developed materials. Particular attention is being paid to the composition of both the nanoparticle inorganic core and the bio-ligand surface layer to increase the multifunctional nature of the materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Colorado State University, and the University of Texas at El Paso will partner in this three-year Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project. During a previous NSF-funded design studio workshop, the project team created a course scaffold and examples of course materials for an integrative course entitled ?The History and Future of Water.? This project plans to further develop and implement that course, as well as to extend the curriculum framework to create new courses in environmental sciences and agricultural biology. Through these courses, STEM graduates should be better prepared to apply their knowledge and skills to solve important global challenges that require scientific expertise. This project addresses the urgent need to increase student interest and persistence in STEM careers to meet the nation?s need for a skilled technical workforce. <br/><br/>This project is a design and development research study to gather evidence about the promise of efficacy of the integration of humanistic perspectives into undergraduate STEM education. Although some empirical studies have reported benefits to this pedagogical approach, the research base is still limited. The team plans to develop and test the STEM Futures course design scaffold, which integrates foundational, humanistic, and meta-knowledge, in three different institutional contexts: a public land grant university, a public regional university, and an Hispanic-serving institution. The instructional team will function as a community of practice, providing feedback to each other informed by personal reflection, student outcome data and products, and digital StoryMap portfolios. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, project researchers will a) examine instructors? adaptations and experience with the design framework and b) determine course impacts on student understandings, critical thinking, self-efficacy, and interest. The three new STEM Futures courses are intended to support broadening participation in STEM by increasing relevance and interest for students, which has been shown to increase overall persistence and success. Further, women, minorities, and students with disabilities may have improved learning outcomes with the STEM Futures course design, which will integrate a variety of cultural perspectives, including those of historically marginalized groups. The project will benefit society by preparing students for 21st century STEM careers, which require the ability to apply knowledge from several domains to solve complex, multi-dimensional problems.

The second class of questions is about the growth of random surfaces and convergence to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling limits.

In some materials this transformation is reversible, so that the material can repeatedly transform back and forth between two shapes, giving rise to the property of ?shape memory?. In a martensitic ceramic like zirconia, the shape change is very large (elongating and contracting a shape by ~10%) and it also exerts very large forces.  For this reason, shape memory materials are like ?solid-state engines?, able to do work on their surroundings as actuators. What is more, it has been recently discovered that shape memory zirconia can be transformed by applying electric fields to it, which opens the door to electronic control over shape memory. With support from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, this project investigates the new property of electrical shape memory in ceramics and develops tools to discover and design new ceramic materials that exhibit this property. The project consists of computational and theoretical efforts to understand how different parameters affect the martensitic transformation, led by Prof. Homer at Brigham Young University, and an experimental effort to validate the phase transformation theory for different orientations of the crystals, temperatures, and applied electric fields. This research to synthesize and test new prospective shape memory ceramics is carried out in Prof. Schuh?s research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This research has implications for actuator device technologies, which have not been as easily miniaturized as other electronic technologies. Additionally, the project will also provide scientific training for two PhD students, one at each institution, and outreach activities will involve a collaborative effort to strengthen the roll out of a Materials Science minor program at BYU to unify materials-oriented students that are spread across different majors on campus.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Supported by the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, this project investigates a new class of shape memory ceramics in which the classical advantages of shape memory (the ability to do large amounts of mechanical work through a solid state phase transformation) are paired with a new mechanism for activating that property (an electric field-driven paraelectric-to-paraelectric phase transformation). Besides developing an entirely new class of ?paraelectroactive? ceramics that can perform meaningful mechanical work and expanding the portfolio of electroactive ceramics, the research also has implications for the theory of phase transformations more broadly. The research involves four interrelated tasks: (1) developing and validating thermodynamic models that incorporate the coupled influence of electrical-thermal-mechanical energy on a paraelectric-to-paraelectric martensitic transformation; (2) examining the role of crystal orientation and anisotropic material properties on the predicted and observed phase transformation conditions; (3) exploring the role of dopants to control the transformation conditions and enable room temperature operation of this phenomenon; (4) expanding the materials-scope of the phenomenon by discovering alternative (non-zirconia) shape memory ceramics that exhibit paraelectric-paraelectric martensitic transformations. These tasks are collaboratively investigated with a primarily experimental effort in Prof. Schuh?s research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Prof. Homer?s research group mostly carrying out theoretical effort at Brigham Young University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Slope stability characterization and monitoring form the core of hazard analysis, yet many commonly used techniques are costly and invasive, or only provide information at a single point. The investigators will use ambient vibration measurements at rock slope instability sites to create new conceptual and practical approaches for landslide structural characterization and progressive failure monitoring. These approaches are based on concepts of structural dynamics, where the resonance properties of slope instabilities are computed and monitored over time, revealing unique information on landslide structural composition and providing new metrics to anticipate the time of failure. The investigators will also use numerical simulations to test the role of landslide failure type on the predicted resonance response, generating new theoretical understanding aiding interpretation of field data and providing guidance for future application of the technique at other sites.<br/><br/>The resonance properties of an unstable rock slope vary with geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions, creating the foundation for non-invasive slope stability characterization and monitoring based on in situ ambient vibration measurements. The investigators will conduct a suite of experiments designed to explore how in situ ambient vibration data can be used to interpret the structural conditions of rock slope instabilities, including boundary conditions at depth, and monitor and interpret progressive failure over time. They hypothesize that in situ ambient vibration data interpreted together with 3D eigenfrequency models allows improved characterization of the material, dynamic and structural properties of rock slope instabilities, and that ambient resonance monitoring provide unique information aiding slope stability hazard assessment and time-of-failure prediction. The investigators will test these hypotheses using a combination of field experiments and numerical models. Field measurements from ambient vibration array deployments, interpreted together with numerical simulations, are used to develop a new approach for characterizing the structural properties and boundary conditions of rock slope instabilities, supporting improved hazard assessment. Meanwhile, ambient vibration monitoring data generated at two field sites are analyzed to develop refined analyses able to distinguish subtle frequency changes associated with progressive failure amidst environmentally-driven drifts. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are used to develop new conceptual understanding of how slope kinematics influence resonant frequency evolution during progressive failure, and interpret failure metrics in tandem with resonance monitoring to demonstrate how ambient vibration data may be used for time-of-failure forecasting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model?s (FCPAM) goal is to develop, implement, evaluate and institutionalize a FCPAM for transforming institutions to be more supportive and culturally sensitive such that the faculty successfully advance through recruitment and retention along early career pathways to tenure in teaching intensive comprehensive universities. This FCPAM is improving the success of early-career faculty such that faculty demographics will mirror student demographics at the three collaborating institutions. This change in faculty demographics will ultimately result in graduating more STEM students from diverse populations and increasing diversity in the STEM workforce. Enhancing diversity within the STEM workforce will contribute to mitigating systemic racism, boosting innovation in the workplace, and enhancing the economy and prosperity within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and our Nation.<br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty, educating America?s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. FCPAM awards are intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar institutions of higher education. FCPAM collaborators also study how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FCPAM, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance AGEP populations.<br/><br/>The foundation of this FCPAM includes a cluster hiring strategy to recruit diverse faculty who will have a shared learning experience and support system across the universities, including a joint faculty development initiative, a faculty mentorship program, common events and shared resources. In addition, the Alliance has a collaborative plan focusing on equity to examine, change, and align institutional policies and procedures in support of a welcoming and supportive academic climate for a diverse faculty. The Alliance will use formative and summative evaluations to document results and evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the model throughout the life of the project. The self-study of the FCPAM development and activities will advance knowledge concerning how socio-cultural, economic, structural, and institutional variables impact the development and success of the Alliance model and the institutional culture changes. An intersectional lens will be used to examine the impact of the FCPAM activities on the success of recruited faculty in relation to their identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, immigration status or national origin, abilities, and being a caregiver or a parent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boolean functions are central to many branches of computer science, including the study of machine-learning algorithms (where a major goal is to efficiently infer Boolean functions based on their input-output performance) as well as hyperefficient ""property testing"" algorithms that inspect only a tiny portion of a massive data set in order to estimate some global property of the data. In a parallel, but to-date largely disconnected, line of research, mathematicians have expended great effort towards understanding structural properties of various types of geometric sets in high-dimensional continuous space. Such sets can also be viewed as ""decision rules"", but ones that amalgamate a list of continuous numerical values, rather than discrete yes/no answers, in order to produce a yes/no value (which indicates whether or not the input point described by the numerical values belongs to the set). Viewed from this very high-level perspective these two lines of research have similar broad goals, but the techniques they use are quite different, and the two fields have mostly considered distinct types of questions and mathematical objects.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators will work to establish and deepen connections between the two settings --- discrete and continuous --- described above. The driving force behind this project is an analogy, developed by the investigators in a sequence of recent works, between Boolean functions that are monotone non-decreasing and high-dimensional sets that are convex. This perspective has already led to a number of surprising new results and suggests a broad range of new notions and questions as well as methods of proof. Building on their preliminary work, the investigators will work to establish new structural results for high-dimensional geometric sets (focusing in particular on convex sets in continuous high-dimensional spaces that are endowed with the Gaussian distribution) that are inspired by analogous structural results that have been established in concrete complexity for Boolean functions.  As mentioned above, the structural results obtained to date in concrete complexity for discrete domains have proved very useful for computer science applications such as computational learning, property testing, and derandomization; the investigators will work to establish similar applications in learning, testing, and derandomization in the continuous setting. The investigators will also develop the connection between the discrete and continuous settings in the other direction, by working to apply some of the powerful methods of high-dimensional convex geometry to obtain new structural and algorithmic results in the discrete Boolean setting. Finally, another important goal of the project is to train graduate students through the process of research collaboration and dissemination, with a particular goal of building expertise that spans both the topics of high-dimensional convex geometry and discrete Boolean concrete complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will attempt to clarify the nature of polymer fracture in order to identify means to increase the threshold for failure.  This could lead to reduction of the annual consumption (several hundred billion pounds) of petroleum-based plastics toward the goal of building a more sustainable economy by lowering the pressure for landfills.  The project will explore and show the benefits of elucidating a connection between the resistance to fracture and the material strength that can be improved through chemical and physical means.   Specifically, fracture behavior of polymeric materials will be examined in a different than conventional way to better illustrate the cause for fracture.  The contrast between existing knowledge and new perspectives would be incorporated in a textbook on all aspects of polymer mechanics that the PI plans to work on.  The project will also help to fill the knowledge gap in this area by training a new generation of scientists and engineers who can generate new solutions to existing and future challenges facing the properties and applications of polymeric materials.  <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The planned project will investigate the fracture behavior of polymeric materials through establishment of a stress criterion based on birefringence measurements.  The overall objective is to identify more effective means to increase the toughness of polymers.    This cannot be achieved without proper explanation of why toughness is a material parameter and what dictates its magnitude.  The PI plans to explore an intimate connection between material mechanical strength and toughness.  For polymers in all forms, i.e., plastic, elastomeric and thermosetting, their brittle fracture behavior will be investigated from an angle that focuses on the stress state at the crack tip.  The investigations will take into account  the following effects.  Enhancement of chain network through pre-melt stretching increases ductility of glassy amorphous polymers.  Preservation of chain network during crystallization avoids brittle fracture in glassy semicrystalline polymers (e.g., crystalline polyethylene terephthalate).  Structural changes to increase load-bearing strands per unit area result in stronger elastomers.  The proposed research will gather more evidence relevant to a scenario where stress state at the crack tip explicitly dictates polymer fracture instead of Griffith-Irwin type energy balance argument.  The entire project will attempt to answer why toughness is a material constant and what factors determine its magnitude for polymers in their various forms. For improvement of ductility and increased toughness of polymers an effective strategy will be explored through enhancement of structure of load-bearing chain network to increase the intrinsic mechanical strength.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding their ability to move is important for controlling them for the benefit of our environment and public health. This research program focuses on the study of swarms of bacteria on a moist surface. The work is performed on a newly discovered species of bacteria called Enterobacter sp. SM3, which manifests robust swarming abilities. The goal of the program is to examine how cell-cell interactions in a crowded population of bacteria affect their movement. The bacterial swarms will be characterized as active matter. Understanding the role of cell-cell interactions in bacterial swarms will aid in the control and treatment of large bacterial populations in environmental situations, such as large mats of bacteria known as biofilms, and in the microbiomes of human and animal intestines. The program will directly fund one PhD dissertation and provide training to several master?s and undergraduate students as research assistants, including undergraduate students from a historically black college for summer research.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/> <br/>The goal of the study is to assess the extent to which intercellular interactions define the swarming motility in a dense bacterial population. The team seeks to observe and characterize specific patterns and collective motion of a large bacterial population under properly designed conditions that vary intercellular interactions, such as dynamic alignment, hydrodynamic entrainment, and flagella entanglement. They also seek to uncover additional interactions mediated either by secreted extracellular matrix materials or by added polymers which serve as a viscoelastic medium. The objective is to account for observed patterns and features of collective motility based on the principles of active matter physics. If successful, the program will provide new insights, not only on bacterial swarming behavior, but also on the collective behavior of individually motile particles in general. The work will further establish bacterial swarms as biologically significant active matter with a range of emergent properties. The program integrates knowledge across the diverse fields of soft matter physics, microbiology, and fluid dynamics. In addition to the direct impact on active matter physics research, the work may also lead to applications in ecology and infection control guided by concepts and strategy rooted in soft matter physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harnessing this potential requires deep understanding of the reactivity of these materials and new methods to create composite materials with novel functionalities. Chemists have a great understanding of the reactivity of small molecules in solution in a homogenous environment.  With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, this research seeks to extend the known precision of small molecules to carbon-based nanomaterials, which have much more complex structures and solid-state organizations. Translating homogenous reactivity concepts for catalysis and sensing is accomplished by building on new methods for attaching structures to or assembling structures around carbon nanomaterials. For example, carbon-based nanomaterials can support metal catalysts when materials that actively bind the metals are part of the assembled compositions. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology develop new methods that deliver electrons on demand to drive reactions in more efficient and selective processes. For example, in many cases in catalysis, rare metals such as platinum are needed. This is particularly true in catalysis needed for energy conversion technologies. This research creates supporting nanomaterials that allow for superior reactivity with much smaller quantities of these valuable materials.  This effort also supports educational opportunities to diversify the STEM workforce through an exchange program between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and minority serving institutions, and to inspire new generations of scientists in both research and business careers. <br/><br/>Technical Summary:  <br/><br/>With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, this research seeks to create multi-component functional materials systems from graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal nanoparticles, and porous polymers.

Covalent modification of the sidewalls of carbon nanotubes is used as a method to ?hard wire? molecular catalytic species to a conductive element and produce high catalytic activity and this approach will be expanded to the generation of asymmetric electrocatalysis. The electrophilic metal-oxo intermediates generated in the oxygen evolution reaction is used to react with alkenes for electrochemical epoxidation and chiral CNT-catalysts are employed to generate optically active epoxides.  The researchers covalently functionalize carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotubes coated with porous poly(phenylene ether)s (PAEs) that contain metal binding ligands, which allows them to investigate reductive coupling of aryl-halides by Ni(0) in such conducting supports. Developing new synthetic methods for PAE opens up the scope of possibilities and a diversity of metal binding ligands can be included in the polymer. The principal investigator and his team also study whether porous ligands containing PAEs could be used to deliver only a single metal center to each NP with the balance of the composition containing one or more other earth abundant metals.  Multi-elemental NP compositions are explored to create catalysts for fuel cell relevant reactions, including ethanol oxidation, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction as well as new chemiresistive sensors. Porous PAEs with integrated dyes are investigated as photoredox catalytic systems, in particular to determine if asymmetric PAE pockets can produce chiral products. In addition to advancing fundamental materials chemistry and potentially producing new commercially relevant technologies, this research also supports educational opportunities to diversify the workforce and inspire new generations of scientists in both research and business careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, previous work to manage computations on shared systems across multiple users and workloads has focused on processing resources: CPUs, GPUs, and RAM (main memory). As the amount of research data that needs to be produced and processed is ever increasing, the Kingfisher framework addresses an important missing link in the chain of distributed capacity management: data storage space. Kingfisher provides abstractions that offer researchers and system administrators semantics for managing the sharing of storage spaces across competing workloads. Once storage can be effectively shared, providers across the nation can allocate storage to the commons through entities such as the OSG Consortium?s Open Science Data Federation, enabling researchers to harness the power of distributed computing in support of data intensive applications.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development and integration of the first element of the Kingfisher framework - the LotManager library. To advance the national CI ecosystem, the storage space management capabilities of the LotManager are integrated with an array of distributed software tools. These tools include the widely adopted HTCondor Software Suite and the XRootD software framework which are used by the OSG Consortium to provide data delivery to the nation?s Science and Engineering (S&E) community. The LotManager is designed to facilitate the sharing of a finite amount of storage capacity across users and projects. Sharing of computing capacity, across administrative and physical boundaries, has been proven to advance scientific discovery via Distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC) at the national and international scales. Such work indicates the value that effective federation of storage capacity can bring to the NSF S&E community. The storage management abstractions and capabilities embodied by LotManager are developed in the context of, and with the feedback from, the OSG's production compute and storage services with real-life experimental data. Consequently, these abstractions and principles result in translational computer science research generally applicable to multi-tenant storage systems beyond the specific system developed in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional data are random functions, which have become increasingly common due to technological advances to handle massive data.  Examples include climate or air pollution data collected over a period of time. The field has emerged as a mainstream research area, but the literature is mainly focused on estimation problems and has not yet leveraged the advantages of deep learning methods. This project aims to fill these gaps. It includes several new tests for functional data and employs deep learning, instead of the conventional nonparametric smoothing methods, to handle functional data. The proposed approaches will be applied to various functional data, including evaluating the effect of pollutants on lung cancer mortality and explaining the effects of physical activity on health.  A major emphasis is the development of new theory and algorithms. Computer code associated with the research will be publicly disseminated as R- or Python packages. The research findings will be incorporated in graduate curricula, undergraduate research projects, and short courses at workshops.  They will also be presented at professional meetings. Student researchers will receive training in research, computing and communication skills.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although functional data are intrinsically infinite dimensional, measurements are only available at discrete locations, which may vary from subject to subject. The number of measurement locations per subject can be small (sparse functional data) or grow with the sample size (intensely sampled functional data). The proposed research covers all types of sampling plans and employs, whenever feasible, a single platform that is universally applicable. Such an approach is important as it is not trivial to judge whether the sampling plan for a particular dataset is intense or sparse. It also has the merit that the theory is unified and automatically reveals the phase transitions of the convergence rates of the corresponding estimators. Project 1 (Hypothesis Testing for Functional Linear Models) aims at developing a general framework for hypothesis testing under the setting of functional linear models.  Existing methods focus on testing a specific null hypothesis using a tailored test and are not well suited for testing the temporal duration of the effect of a functional covariate, such as the impact of PM2.5 on lung cancer. None of them has been shown to be optimal for a composite null hypothesis. We propose a single platform to test the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient of a functional covariate resides in a closed subspace of all possible coefficient functions.  The proposed test, which resembles the classical F-test, is simple and includes tests for global nullity, partial nullity and domain of the coefficient function as special cases. Project 2 (Testing Homogeneity and Independence for Functional Data) addresses the challenges of two fundamental tasks, testing the homogeneity (equal distributions) and independence of functional data. Such tests are infeasible when the functional process can only be sampled at a few discrete locations, a situation that is ubiquitous in longitudinal studies. For each task, we propose a customized version, marginal homogeneity or marginal independence, that has practical implications and is feasible for theory and implementation. Project 3 (Deep learning for Functional Data) aims at bringing the success of deep learning to bear with functional data. Surprisingly, the application of deep neural networks to functional data has been scarce and remains an open problem. A recent approach, developed by a team led by the PI, uses neural networks to search for the optimal basis functions to represent a functional input that automatically adapts to the prediction task in hand. We propose to expand the reach and theoretical understanding of this adaptive basis approach. Another objective is to design new methodology to impute partially observed functional data that uses Transformers, a deep neural network that transforms a given sequence of elements, such as the sequence of words in a sentence, into another sequence. The project will offer a broad range of new opportunities for interdisciplinary training of a future generation of statisticians and will contribute to enhancing a more inclusive atmosphere in statistical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These flows are defined on manifolds equipped with a metric, that is to say, a way of measuring distance. A Ricci flow is a geometric partial differential equation for Riemannian metrics. The Ricci flow tends to evolve an initial metric into a more homogeneous one. The singularity analysis of Ricci flow is a central subject, as it helps to understand the geometry and topology of manifolds. The most remarkable application in this direction is the resolution of the Poincare conjecture and the Geometrization conjecture by Perelman. Many of the Ricci flow singularity models are Ricci solitons. Recent examples of solitons constructed by the PI look like flying wings. The PI will study the geometry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and try to classify them by their asymptotic limits. In addition, the PI will study the higher-dimensional steady Ricci solitons and see if they can arise as singularity models.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The research project is split into two projects. The first project is to prove the O(2)-symmetry of all 3-dimensional steady Ricci solitons. This includes showing that the Bryant soliton is the unique 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton that is asymptotic to a ray. This extends a previous result of the PI in which one assumes the O(2)-symmetry of the soliton. The PI developed some methods that may be extended to the more general class of ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3. In particular, the PI will investigate the symmetry of the ancient collapsed Ricci flows in dimension 3 and aim at classifying them by certain 2-dimensional limits. The second project is a continuation of the PI's work on the existence theory of Ricci flows coming out of non-compact initial manifolds. The PI will investigate the applications of non-compact Ricci flows in topology and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to having a rich history, minimal surfaces are an important tool in analysis of physical systems and geometric questions. A prominent example is the role stable minimal surfaces play in the study of scalar curvature in general relativity.  Just like the soap films they model, minimal surfaces in general have a ""singular set"" where they are not smooth (for example, consider bubbles in the bathtub: they have singular junctions were multiple bubbles meet).  The goal of this project is to work towards better understanding of the singular set of a minimal surface, what structure it possesses, and the behavior of the minimal surface near singularities.  In addition to pursuing these research projects, the PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate students and continue outreach work with a local community center's afterschool math program for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students.<br/><br/>This project studies higher dimensional minimal hypersurfaces that are area-minimizing, stable, or have finite index.  If one precludes, often for natural reasons of orientability, ""Y-type"" singularities (encountered in the bathtub), then the singular set drops to codimension 7.  The project will study the space of 7-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities and finite index/area in a closed 8-manifold, with the view towards a proving a notion of ""bumpiness"" for certain singular minimal hypersurfaces.  The PI will also investigate non-isolated singularities.  The research will also attempt to classify 8-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces in Euclidean space asymptotic to certain cylindrical cones, which would serve to model the geometric degeneration of surfaces towards these cylindrical singularities.

The research team at UTA has recently shown that the energy spectrum of gamma rays resulting from the annihilation of positrons (anti-matter electrons) with electrons at the surface can be used to determine the elemental composition of the topmost layer of external surfaces. The team is now working to demonstrate that positron-annihilation gamma spectroscopy can be used to reveal chemical changes to the hidden surfaces inside of nanoporous metals brought about by catalysis or reactive gas exposure. The project is aimed at the development of a hitherto unavailable tool for the chemical analysis of porous materials' internal surfaces.  The results of this research have potential impact across many areas of research, including catalysis, energy storage, gas separation, carbon capture, and dilute alloy design. The project provides training to undergraduate and graduate students in advanced surface modification and characterization methods. The students involved in this project are from the highly diverse student body of UTA, which is a Hispanic Serving Institution. The research team also collaborates with the STEM academy of the Arlington Independent School District (AISD) to provide training to select high-school students. Participation by students in the cutting-edge research of this project is serving to mold the next generation of leaders in advanced chemistry instrumentation and making a unique contribution to workforce development in this area of critical national need.<br/><br/>The response of catalytically active internal surfaces of porous materials to their environment strongly suggests that surface composition controls catalytic function, demonstrating the need for tools capable of probing internal surfaces with high surface selectivity under in operando conditions. There is a glaring absence of experimental methods that can non-destructively provide chemical information about the top atomic layer of internal surfaces that is free of interference from bulk signals. With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program, the positron research team at UTA is developing an in operando characterization tool for the inaccessible internal surfaces with elemental sensitives as low as 1% of the topmost atomic layer. The team is combining the superior surface selectivity of positron spectroscopy with the ability of 511 keV annihilation gamma radiation to exit through millimeters of sample or reaction cells without any loss of information. The unparalleled surface selectivity of the technique stems from the trapping of the implanted positrons in an image-potential well on the vacuum side of the sample surface before annihilation. As recently demonstrated by the UTA team, the energy spectrum of the gamma radiation resulting from the annihilation of the surface-trapped positrons reflects the elemental composition of the topmost atomic layer through the element-specific Doppler broadening of the annihilation gamma energy. Using calibration spectra obtained from controlled external surfaces to benchmark the Doppler broadened annihilation spectrum, the team is now developing the technique to measure the chemical composition at the internal surfaces of nanoporous gold (Au) and nanoporous copper (Cu), including variations that occur upon exposure to reactive gases or during catalysis. The research team is exploring the nature of catalytically active sites in these materials with the goal of providing a global view of the internal surface configuration of nanoporous Au and Cu under the action of reactive stimuli like ozone and carbon monoxide through controlled experiments in ultrahigh vacuum and in operando conditions. In addition to the scientific broader impacts of the work, the project provides advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and supports outreach activities to engage local high school students in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The extracellular matrix is a complex mesh of proteins and carbohydrates, and it is connected to the cells it surrounds, holding them together to form a tissue. Amyloids are proteinaceous deposits/aggregates. Amyloid formation is a critical factor in many normal biological processes and in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The importance of carbohydrates and the surface of cell membranes in modulating amyloid formation have been recognized by the scientific community. However, it has been challenging to isolate and quantify how specific intermolecular interactions influence or nucleate the formation of particular amyloid aggregation states. The proposed research will exploit and extend computational models, developed over the last few years in Dr. Matysiak?s lab, that now enable the Matysiak group to pursue this type of research. This research will also allow graduate and undergraduate students to acquire specialized training in multiscale computational modeling.

Often targeted for biomedical applications within the body, microrobots (microbots) could be used to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to specific locations to treat cancer or to break up blockages within blood vessels as in the case of stroke or in heart diseases. Challenges remain however both in fabricating microbots and powering them, especially when biocompatible materials are desired. This award will study and test the use of soft liquid microbots, created with a magnetic shell that allows directed rolling with application of an external magnetic field. Fabricated using emulsion-based techniques, this approach allows for easy synthesis, ready control, enhanced biocompatibility, and efficient drug delivery. The motion of these soft microbots over surfaces is different from their rigid counterparts. This award will investigate the traction and movement of soft microbots over a variety of hard and soft surfaces under the applied magnetic fields to enhance and optimize their movement for targeted applications. <br/><br/>Microbot locomotion is challenging because of the reversible nature of microscale fluid flow, a limitation that can be overcome by breaking flow-field symmetry with a nearby surface. When translating along an interface, rolling microbots travel faster than sliding ones because of their significantly smaller friction coefficient. This phenomenon has been utilized with rotating wheel-shaped microbots for targeting occlusive clots located in small arteries, delivering drugs, and inducing lysis via a combination of mechanical and biochemical action. Recent studies, however, have used rigid microbots that roll inefficiently with significant slip and difficulty navigating confined environments. Addressing these drawbacks, this award proposes the use of soft microbots based on superparamagnetic Pickering emulsions. They will provide enhanced biocompatibility and large drug encapsulation capacity and can alter their shape to enhance traction by accommodating interactions with viscoelastic in vivo environments. Soft Pickering emulsion microbots will be fabricated and the nature of their transport on various surfaces and in various environments will be investigated. The ability of these soft microbots to transport and deliver drugs within various biomimetic environments will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how living things can flourish under extreme conditions is important for guiding the search for life elsewhere in the universe.  It also has many practical applications, since the enzymes from these microorganisms, ?extremozymes?, are extraordinarily useful. Their stability under extreme conditions has enabled numerous applications, such as enzymes included in cold-water ?biodetergents?, high temperature ?bio-pulping? enzymes for more eco-friendly paper-processing, and high-pressure enzymes for food processing.  Despite their numerous applications, the factors that lead to extremozyme stability are still not completely understood.  Some theories propose that the molecular motion within these proteins determines the ranges of stability and activity.  However, there is not enough good quantitative information about extremozyme motion under different conditions.  For this project, proteins from various extremophiles will be produced by undergraduates at San Jose State and PCOM Georgia.  The motion in these proteins will be measured by SETI scientists using novel x-ray techniques.  The results will be tested against theoretical calculations by graduate students at Georgetown University.  Underrepresented high school and undergraduate students from local schools will be involved in field trips and summer research projects.<br/><br/>This project is undertaken to gain experimental data on atomic motion in proteins from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles and from mesophiles to obligate piezophiles, under a range of temperatures and pressures.  Experiments performed by using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) will provide information on motion of Fe atoms at the active sites of rubredoxin and cytochrome P450 and Te atoms in the middle or on the periphery of the target proteins. X-ray diffraction and nuclear resonant time domain interferometry (NR-TDI) will quantify motion in polypeptide helices and loops of these proteins. The data will test two hypotheses concerning protein dynamics.  The project will specifically look for ?protein glass transitions?, which are proposed Temperature-dependent changes in protein flexibility over the range of 180-220 K.  The project will also test the ?corresponding states? paradigm, which says that proteins in an extremophile have been adapted to maintain equivalent flexibility under the different environmental conditions favored for each organism. Finally, the project is aimed to determine the best combination of force fields and water models for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce and interpret the experimental data collected for a set of proteins.

Their discoveries could lead to new methods to prepare multifunctional materials where the properties of the molecules on the particle surface can work in concert with those of the metal. In addition, this research is the basis of educational modules using nanotechnology and catalysis to engage with Miami-Dade County School students in a multi-generational model from middle to high school.<br/><br/>The transformational properties of inorganic nanomaterials focus almost exclusively on the inorganic core where the ligand shell is typically limited to controlling stability and solubility. While these are two key factors in nanoparticle structure-property relationships, a great expansion of properties could be achieved by engendering the ligand shell with additional functionalities that work synergistically with the inorganic component to achieve a multifunctional platform. Professors Knecht and Frenkel hypothesize that multidomain peptides can be designed to generate functional nanoparticle ligand interfaces that operate synergistically with the inorganic core. Such peptides are being designed with materials binding domains and a second functional domain presented to solution. In this arrangement, the properties of the functional domain of the peptide are being tuned to operate in tandem with the properties of the nanoparticle inorganic core, resulting in a multifunctional platform. Catalytic processes and advanced spectroscopic methods are being used to monitor these properties and functions of the newly developed materials. Particular attention is being paid to the composition of both the nanoparticle inorganic core and the bio-ligand surface layer to increase the multifunctional nature of the materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A, Professor Chang and his research team at the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth are developing a new chemical analysis tool to enable detailed studies of electrochemical reaction mechanisms associated with conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to less harmful materials, a promising route to mitigating climate change. Specifically, the team is developing a novel technique, named single-molecule specific (SMS) voltammetry, to probe the performance of single nanoparticles as catalysts for CO2 reduction reactions. The research may advance our ability to design electrocatalysts that efficiently convert CO2 into fuels. A broad educational program introduces this research to undergraduate and graduate students, and includes outreach activities to inspire underrepresented K-12 students in South Massachusetts to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a platform to quantify the products of electrochemical CO2 reduction on single nanoparticles, and to reveal the morphology-dependent performance and stability of nanoelectrocatalysts. Carbon monoxide (CO) formation on Au nanoparticles is used as a model reaction. Specifically, the research is addressing the following objectives: (1) Demonstration of the ability of single-molecule specific (SMS) voltammetry to quantify CO formation on single nanoparticles. (2) Assessment of the effects of interparticle and intraparticle heterogeneity on CO formation on single electrocatalysts. (3) Identification of the mechanism(s) of nanoparticle instability during CO2 reduction reactions. By combining SMS voltammetry, super-resolution fluorescence, and electron microscopies, the research team is striving to elucidate the morphology-dependent activity for CO formation and super-resolve the facet-dependent active sites on single nanoelectrocatalysts.

It deals with the problem of determining or estimating the maximum or minimum possible value of an invariant of a combinatorial structure that satisfies certain requirements as well as with the investigation of inequalities between combinatorial invariants, and questions dealing with relations among them. The Principal Investigator intends to investigate several questions in the area, including ones that are motivated by algorithmic applications. The specific topics to be studied include old and new problems in Graph Theory and Combinatorics, as well as the algorithmic aspects of questions about fair representations of necklaces and graphs. The non-constructive solutions of some of these questions combine algebraic and topological tools, leaving the fascinating problem of finding algorithmic solutions open.<br/><br/>The proposal addresses several fundamental old and new combinatorial problems. Besides their intrinsic interest, many of these problems are motivated by related questions in other areas. In particular, the study of splitting random necklaces has a surprising connection to questions about random walks in Euclidean spaces and about matchings in nearly regular uniform hypergraphs.  The algorithmic aspects of the necklace theorem are intriguing in view of the recent  results about the hardness of the problem.  The related study of the algorithmic aspects of some of the other fair partitioning problems described in the project is also challenging. The investigation of Graph Codes, which is interesting in its own right, is also motivated by questions about Ramsey type results in Additive Combinatorics. The methods the Principal Investigator intends to apply combine combinatorial, probabilistic, algebraic and geometric tools with ideas from Coding Theory. It is expected that progress on the problems mentioned here will be interesting and significant, will hopefully lead to the development of novel fruitful techniques, and will yield interesting applications and insights in related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Jackson of Michigan State University are studying new methods to control the three-dimensional structure and ""handedness"" of products in reactions that generate carbon-halogen and carbon-nucleophile bonds in the same operation. The products of these reactions serve as important chiral building blocks for many applications, for example, for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active agents or of agrochemicals. The Borhan-Jackson teams are working to expand and refine methods to catalyze the formation of a wide range of compounds of a specific desired handedness from much simpler starting substances. Sophisticated analysis techniques will be brought to bear on the areas of study such that superior catalysts can be rationally designed, in contrast to the essentially trial-and-error approaches used in the past. Ultimately, it is anticipated that this work will lead to more efficient processes for the manufacture of chiral molecules of importance to science, engineering, medicine, and commerce. The broader impacts of the funded project will extend to allowing the two PIs and their coworkers to recruit, train, and scientifically stimulate high school and undergraduate students in the laboratory via programs such as Project SEED. The involvement of these early stage science students many of whom belong to groups underrepresented in the physical sciences, in a dynamic, international lab and learning community, has the potential to help diversify the pool of students considering future STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)-based study and careers.<br/><br/>Halofunctionalizations of alkenes have recently joined the list of broadly applicable and genuinely useful chemical transformations that can be achieved in an enantioselective manner using chiral catalysis. However, to date, the most effective catalysts for asymmetric halenium-alkene addition processes, for example the well-known cinchona alkaloid dimer (DHQD)2PHAL, have been identified largely on an empirical basis. This collaborative project focuses on detailed mechanistic analyses of important classes of halofunctionalization reactions with the goal of enabling the rational design of simplified and practical new catalysts that are both affordable and highly selective. The approach taken is multi-faceted and involves examination of reaction kinetics, isotopic label tracing, kinetic isotope effects, quantum chemical models, and spectroscopic and structural analyses, with particular attention to the interactions among substrate alkenes, halogenation agents, and catalyst reactive sites. With an emphasis on allylamides, the investigative team will survey intramolecular halocyclizations and intermolecular halofunctionalizations, derive rate laws for each class of reaction, and determine the factors that control the mechanistic pathways. The alkene additions of interest form two new stereocenters in one step, potentially giving rise to four structurally distinct chiral products, or even eight when both regiochemical possibilities may be accessed. Coming from simple olefinic starting materials, this diversity of complex, functional group rich products is valuable, but only if the selectivity can be controlled. This research aims to provide the intellectual foundation needed to achieve generalized catalyst and process design, accelerating discovery based upon mechanistic understanding. If successful, these collaborative experimental/mechanistic studies will provide a useful model for the design and development of stereoselective catalysts well beyond the halenium-alkene addition reactions under study here.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Paige M Henning is ""Identification of the S-protein homolog (SPH) receptor proteins in Turnera subulata and high throughput initial characterization of the SPH family in Arabidopsis thaliana"" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Wisconsin Madison and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael R Sussman.<br/><br/>Responsible use of genetic engineering has the potential to be highly beneficial for agriculture and human health, enabling improvements in crop yield and nutritional value. While genetically engineered crops have benefits, there are potential consequences. Escape of transgenic traits from transgenic into non-transgenic crops and wild plant populations being one of the most significant. For example the passing of the herbicide resistance trait from transgenic corn to non-transgenic neighboring cornfields during reproduction. This is an economic, ecological and ethical problem, and it is our responsibility to take measures to prevent the spread of transgenic traits. One solution to prevent transgenic traits escaping is to prevent reproduction between transgenic and non-transgenic crops or wild species. While this can be done with physical barriers , this approach is labor-intensive, expensive, and not applicable for all crop species. An alternative is to engineer a ""reproductive"" barriers. Essentially to remove the transgenic species' ability to mate with non-transgenic individuals of the same or related species. To do so, we propose to emulate the naturally occurring barrier found in the reproductive system of the Cuban buttercup (Turnera subulata) in transgenic crops. To do this we need to thoroughly understand the genetic basis of this reproductive system. This research will use computational methods, genetics, and biochemistry to learn more about the Cuban buttercup's reproductive system. Furthermore, this study will shed light on functions of a large family of signaling peptides that likely regulate diverse aspects of growth and development, using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.<br/><br/>Signaling peptides play varied and critical roles during stress responses as well as growth, reproductive, and developmental processes in the plant. A few signaling peptide families have been characterized, but an alarming number of families remain entirely uncharacterized. Characterizing signaling peptides may provide targets of interest to synthetic biology. The S-protein homolog (SPH) signalling peptide family was initially identified in Papaver rhoeas. PrsS, the only characterized SPH, confers self-incompatibility in P. rhoeas. TsSPH1, identified at the self-incompatibility locus in distylous Turnera subulata, is predicted to modify anther placement within flowers by enhancing filament elongation, though the mechanism is unknown. Expanding our knowledge of TsSPH1 will expand our understanding of the morphology and breakdown of distyly, an Angiosperm reproductive system that confers self-incompatibility. Aside from PrsS, the SPH family has not been investigated in any species, including the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. The goals of this project are 1.) to identify the receptor of TsSPH1, 2.) to determine if orthologs of this receptor are present in homostylous species of Turneroideae, 3.) to form hypotheses regarding the mode of action of TsSPH1, and 4.) begin the initial characterization of the SPH gene family in Arabidopsis using high throughput methods. The characterization of the SPH gene family in Arabidopsis will allow researchers to form hypotheses regarding the roles of SPH family members in other organisms based on homology with Arabidopsis family members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of such models are given by random three-dimensional stepped surfaces, interacting particles systems, the six-vertex model (used to describe the structure of a thin film of water molecules), and interacting avoiding random walkers (sometimes called line ensembles). Many of these models have remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties, which makes their study tractable. The main goal of the project is to obtain a detailed description (involving exact mathematical formulas) of the asymptotic behavior of these random systems as their size (volume and/or the number of particles) grows.  <br/><br/>The project involves three interwined directions of research. The first involves the derivation and asymptotic analysis of joint observables for integrable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A distinguished feature of integrable models is that they allow for various exact formulas of different observables. A notorious problem with many of these formulas is that they are difficult to study asymptotically, due to the presence of hard to control cross-terms, and one of the goals of the project is to develop a framework for analyzing these cross-terms. The second direction of the project is to establish universal scaling limits for Gibbsian line ensembles. Various integrable models, such as Hall-Littlewood processes and the log-gamma polymer, naturally carry a structure of a line ensemble and it is expected that these ensembles converge to the parabolic Airy line ensemble (one of the universal scaling limits in the KPZ universality class) -- the project seeks to establish this statement. The third direction of the project is to utilize loop equations to understand the scaling limits of multi-level interacting particle systems, which are discrete analogues of the beta-corners processes from random matrix theory and are related to Jack symmetric functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims at resolving some longstanding issues with application of multiple testing methods. One of these issues arises in the context of discovering, among a large collection of variables, those that are important influences on an outcome of interest. Inapplicability of standard multiple testing methods due to the unknown interdependency of the variables is such an issue. The methods under development aim to provide new approaches to discovering important variables no matter how the variables depend on each other, with the guarantee that, on average, only a small, controlled fraction of unimportant variables end up as false discoveries. An example application is in the identification of genetic variants which, among many thousands of them, can influence a certain disease. The new methods can aid in identifying genes as being relatively more relevant for therapeutic intervention. The fundamental theoretical and methodological ideas behind the development of these methods will be extended towards resolving similar issues with multiple testing methods in other experimental settings as well. The research to be carried out in the project will be incorporated into courses, benefiting the training of undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/>This research project is focused on addressing important theoretical and methodological issues related to multiple testing. For instance, feature/variable selection under the setting of multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise, which plays an important role in data science and is a ubiquitous statistical framework in scientific investigations, is often framed as a multiple testing problem. A p-value based multiple testing method, irrespective of what error rate is being considered to control the falsely discovered important explanatory variables, capturing the correlation matrix of the explanatory variables in full without losing control over the error rate, would be most ideal. Unfortunately, such methods are yet to be developed in a non-asymptotic setting. Similarly, for the related problem of simultaneous testing of multivariate Gaussian means with non-diagonal correlation matrix, subject to a control of an error rate, a p-value based multiple testing method fully capturing the correlation information without losing control over that rate is largely absent from the literature. The challenges will be met by research that cross-fertilizes two seminal ideas on multiple inference: 1) the use of p-value based multiple testing methods to control false discoveries; and 2) the use of the knockoff of the design matrix for variable selection in linear regression settings. Concretely, the project aims at developing novel p-value based false discovery rate and other powerful error rates controlling multiple testing methods for 1) variable selection in multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise, both in low- and high-dimensional settings; and 2) simultaneous testing of multivariate Gaussian means with a general non-diagonal covariance matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The adherents of fundamentalist movements consider their religion to be a system of absolute truth, promote strict conformity to the religious laws and moral precepts specified in the scriptures, and have mustered considerable influence in some regions in recent decades. It is, however, unclear to what extent the groups studied here hold fundamentalist beliefs and attitudes. To make this assessment, this project will launch a full-scale survey of religious fundamentalism and other cultural and sociopolitical values. Building on a earlier study of the subject in the region, this project evaluates the similarities and differences in fundamentalism between people in different groups throughout the region.  This project also gauges how fundamentalist beliefs and attitudes among individuals are linked to their (a) religiosity, (b) identity, (c) liberal values, (d) the feelings of insecurity and xenophobia, (e) sources of information, and (f) demographics.  Increased understanding of what affects societal values and weakens fundamentalism contributes to a better knowledge of how to engineer peace and avoid conflict.<br/><br/>The existence of considerable variability in the fundamentalist movements among the followers of the Abrahamic faiths complicates comparative analysis of the subject, hampers empirical generalization across these faiths, and poses difficulties in theoretical abstraction. To overcome these challenges, this project theorizes that fundamentalists, despite their variabilities across religions and sects, share core orientations toward their own and other religions. These core orientations rest on a disciplinarian conception of the deity, literalism or inerrancy, religious exclusivity, and religious intolerance. To measure these orientations, a fundamentalism scale based on a battery of sixteen survey questions was constructed and validated. This study employs this scale to gauge fundamentalism among a representative sample of 3,300 adult respondents from contrasting groups, using both face-to-face and online interviews. By developing a fundamentalism scale that measures the subject in all the Abrahamic faiths, this project makes a significant contribution to the social-scientific study of fundamentalism and comparative religious studies. The collected dataset will also serve as an infrastructure for comparative analysis and make it possible to engage in scientific dialogue among different researchers studying the subject in the region and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fenn received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002.  The Williams lab is investigating how the size and shape of ESI droplet emitters affect the initial droplet size and resulting performance of ESI MS.  Charge detection mass spectrometry - a technique that is being developed in the Williams lab - is used to weigh both droplets and residues from dehydrated droplets in order to infer information about initial droplet sizes.  The physics of droplet breakup from excess charge is also probed using this device, with goals of improved understanding of the ion formation process, and improved analytical performance.  Computational modeling supports these efforts, providing a more detailed understanding of the physics behind these processes.  The nanoscale emitters enable measurements from biochemical systems using the same types of buffers as used for measurements with other methods.  Heating these emitters enables assessment of the thermal stabilities of proteins and protein complexes - information that is important in understanding phenomena such as drug-target interactions and protein therapeutics.  A laser heating method that extends these measurements to aggregation-prone proteins and improves measurement speed by at least a factor of ten is being developed and could replace traditional methods that are widely used in protein chemistry and in pharmaceutical labs.  Students working on this project learn important skills, including how to design rigorous experiments, to interpret data without bias, and to communicate their results to the broader community.<br/><br/>The Williams lab is studying the chemistry and physics of charged aqueous nanodrops with diameters between ~10 nm and 1 micron formed using custom electrospray emitters.  Charge detection mass spectrometry provides a means of detecting how the emitter tip diameter and taper affect the initial nanodrop sizes, and to establish conditions needed to achieve a single analyte molecule per droplet.  The work seeks improved understanding of how analyte ions are formed from charged nanodrops and how anions affect cation emission.  Molecular dynamics simulations of ion emission of small folded proteins are being tested through direct measurement of ion emission in trapped aqueous nanodrops below 40 nm diameter.  A parallel goal is to explore emitter characteristics that improve performance of native mass spectrometry using traditional biochemical buffers containing high concentrations of nonvolatile salts.  This will facilitate direct comparison of mass spectrometry data with that obtained from complementary biophysical methods using the same solutions.  The effect of different matrices on protein stability, structure, and stoichiometry in solution are being investigated using resistively heated capillaries to measure thermal stabilities.  A new laser-based method to make these measurements significantly faster is being developed for application to proteins that are prone to aggregation at elevated temperatures.

Macroalgae range in form from >30-m high giant kelp to mm-scale filamentous turfs. They shape aquatic ecosystems worldwide, providing food and habitat to legions of species including many important to coastal fisheries and recreation. At the same time, the diversity of macroalgal species and forms makes it challenging to understand the processes affecting their abundance and distribution. Past efforts to define functional groups based on gross morphology ? for example, finely branching vs. large-bladed or erect vs. prostrate - have had some success in interpreting ecological patterns, yet key information is lost and quantitative tests of predictions often fail with such broad groupings. Alternatively, trait-based modeling is a promising approach to incorporate more complexity and define relationships between quantifiable characteristics, such as blade mass per area, and the distribution and abundance of species. This project combines field, laboratory, and modeling components to measure macroalgal traits and validate models of species distribution in the coastal ocean. The outcome will be a framework for macroalgal communities that can be used to predict how the distribution of groups and species change across space and time. The project will provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in field and laboratory research. Educational outreach efforts will leverage collaboration with the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project to reach K-12 students and teachers, including urban Los Angeles. Other outreach includes interaction with the media, the Santa Barbara Sea Center, and agencies such as the Santa Barbara Channel National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park. <br/><br/>Community ecology is often mired in case histories explaining distribution and abundance of select species, yet we need a more holistic understanding of the forces driving marine ecosystems to predict change due to climate and human impacts. In temperate marine ecosystems, macroalgae serve as the base of food webs and provide habitat, but we lack a framework for understanding macroalgal ecology beyond decades-old gross morphological generalizations. Trait-based modeling is a promising approach to incorporate complexity and define relationships between quantifiable traits and the distribution and abundance of species. The investigators are combining field and laboratory measurements with modeling to assess how well the depth distribution of common macroalgal species in southern California is predictable based on measured functional traits. The project objectives include: 1) define and measure key functional traits within and across key species of macroalgae; 2) create a trait-based simulation model for the assemblage of nearshore macroalgal communities as a function of depth; 3) test the model?s predictions by quantifying the depth distribution of macroalgal species, grazers, and environmental parameters in the Santa Barbara Channel; and 4) use individual-based models to test mechanistic hypotheses for interspecific competition. The investigators are accomplishing the first objective by measuring a suite of functional traits related to performance at multiple sites (and depths) for at least 20 species of common macroalgae in the Santa Barbara Channel, including mass-specific photosynthetic rate, nitrogen uptake rate, specific blade area, canopy height, crown area, blade thickness, mechanical and material properties, lifespan, and grazing resistance. For objective 2 the investigators are creating an ecosystem model that represents a large number of potentially viable macroalgal ?species? with stochastically determined physiological characteristics. Initialized species will interact with one another and their environment, evolving into an ecosystem where community structure and diversity are not imposed, but are emergent properties. The third objective involves an extensive field program to quantify the distribution of all identifiable macroalgal species across a depth gradient from 0 m to the terminus of hard substrate (up to 40m depth) at six sites in the Santa Barbara Channel. Physical properties (light, temperature, wave forces) are also measured along each cross-depth transect. In the fourth objective, the investigators are using results to improve their model, adding interspecific competition in an individual-based framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When designing enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), it is necessary to understand the multiscale, multiphysics, thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes that impact the EGS dynamics and productivity. This project aims to gain a fundamental understanding of key mechanisms controlling the dynamics in EGS (solid displacement, fluid flow, and heat transfer) and sustainability of EGS reservoirs through numerical simulations. A novel numerical simulation framework to be built through this project will allow for designing, managing, and optimizing energy production from EGS.<br/> <br/>The THM processes in EGS can be described by Biot?s thermo-poroelasticity model, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Any desirable numerical methods for THM systems should preserve the underlying physical laws, such as mass and energy conservation, and present no numerical instabilities for a wide range of physical and simulation parameters. This project seeks to develop a unified numerical modeling framework based on adaptive enriched Galerkin (EG) methods to provide robust and physics-preserving numerical methods whose numerical analysis is feasible. The proposed EG schemes are mass conservative and free of numerical instabilities commonly present in poroelasticity and coupled flow-transport problems. The mass conservation property, stability, and convergence behaviors of the proposed methods will be studied mathematically and confirmed numerically. Moreover, residual-based a posteriori error estimators will be derived and utilized for designing dynamic mesh adaptivity techniques. The developed EG algorithms will be implemented within finite element software packages to verify the theoretical results and validate the new numerical model's capabilities to capture the EGS dynamics. The performance of the new EG methods will be compared with that of state-of-the-art numerical methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central challenge is to classify all maps from spheres to other spheres, where two maps are considered equivalent if one can be deformed to the other. The equivalence classes of these maps are called the homotopy groups of spheres, and collectively they form one of the deepest and most central objects in the field. Historically, much important theory has arisen out of attempts to compute more homotopy groups of spheres and understand patterns within them. This project involves furthering knowledge of the homotopy groups of spheres, using old and new techniques as well as computer calculations. The project also involves studying an analogue of these groups in algebraic geometry; this falls under a relatively new and actively developed area called motivic homotopy theory, which applies techniques in algebraic topology to study algebraic geometry. The broader impacts of this project center around supporting the local mathematics community through mentoring and promoting diversity. The principal investigator will help build the nascent homotopy theory community at the university and promote women and minorities in the subject through seminar organization and mentoring.<br/> <br/>One of the main planned projects is a large-scale effort to compute the homotopy groups of spheres at the prime 3 in a range, using old and new techniques such as the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence as well as infinite descent machinery.

Another main group of projects concerns computing the analogue of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in the world of R-motivic homotopy theory. This represents a continuation of prior work of the PI and collaborator; the plan is to supplement the techniques used in that work with computer calculations and a new tool, the slice spectral sequence.

This chromosome has properties that, based on analysis of its DNA sequence, have allowed it to persist from one generation to the next for millions of years, despite the fact that it is not needed for the plant. While these properties are beneficial to the success of the B chromosome, they often have negative consequences for the normal corn chromosomes such as chromosome fracture and the activation of transposable elements that have the potential to jump around the genome and cause mutations. A genetic and molecular analysis will be conducted to learn the nature of these B chromosome properties and how the corn genome has been impacted by the presence of the B chromosome. The B chromosome appears to have been involved in restructuring the corn chromosomes, so an understanding of these properties will help provide insight into the nature of, and variation in the maize genome. The research will involve participants at all educational levels and will involve training in genetics, genomics, and computational biology. <br/><br/>The supernumerary B chromosome of maize is a novel, selfish genetic system involving a whole chromosome that impacts genomic processes in general. The B chromosome has manipulated cellular processes to ensure proper segregation in male meiosis by increasing recombination in heterochromatin, by using a novel meiotic process to stabilize itself in meiosis, by delaying replication of the centromere at the one mitosis that makes the two sperm, and by mediating fertilization of the egg by B containing sperm. Experiments will examine the mechanism of centromere nondisjunction, the identity and function of the trans-acting factors needed for nondisjunction, the nature of the univalent stabilization process, the nature of the modulation of recombination across the genome, and aspects of genomic conflict such as de-silencing of transposable elements, identifying the gene responsible for genomic shattering by B chromosomes in some backgrounds, and the gene responsible for variation in preferential fertilization. The completion of this project will provide data that support a new paradigm in the understanding of a suite of co-opted functions by a mega selfish genetic entity. The interdisciplinary team will seek to understand this selfish entity to gain new insight into concepts previously unexplored in any system about genetic drive and genomic conflict.

However, a general theory that explains their success is still lacking. One popular approach is to impose structure on the gradient noise, typically modeled by Gaussian or other light-tailed distributions. However, many empirical and some recent theoretical works challenge these assumptions, calling for an understanding of heavy-tailed distributions and resulting phenomena in machine learning. In this project, a theoretical framework will be built towards understanding and explaining why and how heavy tailed distributions arise in popular machine learning algorithms, and how heavy tails can better explain their success, bridging a gap between theory and practice. The results derived from this project are expected to impact the mathematics community as well as developers and  practitioners in the data science and machine learning communities.  <br/><br/>In this project, theoretical convergence properties and performance guarantees will be obtained for heavy-tailed stochastic gradient descent, their accelerated momentum-based methods, and continuous-time approximations.

One feature of low dimensions is the existence of deep structures known as TQFTs (Topological Quantum Field Theories), many originating in quantum physics and having applications to condensed matter, statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The Prinicipal Investigator will be studying such topological theories of more general type, where the theory is known on topological objects without boundary (closed objects) and extended canonically to objects with boundary. These constructions proved fruitful for explicit combinatorial construction of link homology theories, where topological objects are foam-like two-dimensional structures embedded in 3-space. The author has recently shown that a semi-linear version of this construction in dimension one extends so-called finite state automata and regular languages, which is a classical subject in computer science. This opens possibility of many generalizations, including exploring connections between more general languages and topological theories and possible relations between two-dimensional theories and cellular automata. Further studies of topological theories and related topics of foams and link homology should lead to fruitful discoveries in low-dimensional topology and related fields.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project has three major goals. The first major goal is to further develop the theory of foams, their evaluations and applications in link homology and categorification. Foams are two-dimensional CW-complexes with generic singularities. They have proved instrumental in combinatorial approaches to GL(N) link homology theories and boast tantalizing connections to instanton Floer homology for orbifolds. The PI will further develop topological theories related to foams, with an eye towards technically difficult problems, such as computation of Kronheimer-Mrowka homology of embedded trivalent graphs and finding combinatorial counterpart of that homology. The second goal is to find approaches to several link homology theories, including Cautis, Webster and Qi-Sussan homologies, to establish their functoriality and extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. A number of important link homology theories, including triply-graded HOMFLYPT homology, Webster, Cautis, and Qi-Sussan homology, are missing a functorial extension to tangle cobordisms and, in most cases, a related extensions to tangles. The PI will develop new approaches to these homology theories to redefine them, repair functoriality where necessary, and extend them to link cobordisms. The third goal is to understand universal theories in low dimensions. The PI will continue studying universal construction of topological theories, motivated by recent successes such as the interpretation of finite state automata and regular languages via one-dimensional topological theories with defects and taking values in the Boolean semiring B, where a regular language and a circular regular language give rise to a rigid symmetric monoidal B-linear category.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Kyle Swentowsky is ?Developmental genetics and genomics of perennial regrowth in Zea diploperennis?. The host institution for the fellowship is Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. David Jackson.<br/><br/>All plants are classified as either ?annuals? that live for only one year or ?perennials? that can live for many. Staple crops such as corn (maize), wheat, and rice are cultivated as annuals and are replanted from seed each year. Perennials, however, recycle their energy and nutrients for multiple growing seasons to achieve sustainable, long-term growth. Compared to annuals, perennial plants tend to develop larger and deeper root systems during multiple years of growth, which allow them to access more water and nutrients in the soil. The development of perennial versions of existing crop species has the potential to combat challenges American farmers face due to climate change. Plant breeders have attempted to generate perennial maize lines but have so far been unsuccessful. Careful analysis of the perennial life cycle has not yet been performed in grass species, and a detailed understanding of this biological process will greatly assist perennial breeding efforts. The goal of this project is to study how a perennial species closely related to maize achieves a perennial life cycle. This will include a description of how some plant organs can remain dormant during the initial growth cycle and become re-activated to achieve perenniality. Discovering how some grass species maintain a perennial life cycle can help us develop perennial versions of existing cereal crops such as corn, wheat, rice, and sorghum that can be grown as sustainable options to combat the difficult growth conditions posed by climate change.<br/><br/>Perennial plants can regrow for multiple years and perennial crops are efficient sustainable agriculture systems. Some progress has been made in breeding perennial cereal crops but breeding perennial maize has been largely unsuccessful due to our poor understanding of genes and developmental mechanisms that control perenniality. Regrowth occurs in grasses when dormant axillary buds become active and although this general process has been well-studied in annual species, it is unclear how perennials coordinate regrowth with other life cycle events. In this project, the close maize perennial relative, Zea diploperennis, will be used to investigate how phytohormone, sugar, flowering, and plant age signaling pathways impact perennial regrowth. This system will be used to test the hypothesis that: (1) the maintenance of Z. diploperennis tiller buds in a juvenile and non-flowering state is necessary for perennial regrowth; and (2) dormant tiller buds become reactivated through phytohormone or carbohydrate signaling after flowering to begin the next cycle of perennial growth. Mechanisms of perennial regrowth will be studied using state of the art imaging, genetics, and single-cell RNA-sequencing techniques. Additionally, a previously identified QTL that controls regrowth will be fine-mapped to identify candidate perennial genes. All sequencing data will be deposited into the public NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and seeds generated during this project will be made publicly available via the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will advance research in the theory of optimal transport of stochastic processes. A special emphasis will be placed on applications to mathematical finance, such as martingale optimal transport and time-dynamic utility optimization problems. The derived theory will lay the basis for advances of numerical routines and novel indicators of model uncertainty, which will help to prepare decision-makers for worst-case scenarios.<br/><br/>This project especially focuses on the adapted Wasserstein distance and entropic regularization of optimal transport, which is the method of choice for computing optimal transport problems in high dimensions.

These results are then applied to quantify model uncertainty in robust portfolio optimization and Davis pricing, machine learning of time-dependent distributions and hedging in financial markets. For each of these problems, closed-form expressions are derived and these are implemented numerically. The second part of the project investigates stability of Schroedinger potentials -- the dual optimizers of the entropic optimal transport problem -- via a strong compactness result and approximation techniques. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of calibrated martingale measures with finite entropy are derived on the basis of a reference model and marginal distributions derived from market prices, as well as a characterization of the optimizers of the martingale optimal transport problem with entropic penalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has motivated companies to manufacture computer chip hardware, such as graphical processing units (GPUs) that can perform very fast computations using low precision computer arithmetic formats. This can result in a 4-times speedup compared to high precision arithmetic used in typical scientific applications. The potential for much faster computations has fueled a growing interest in the last decade to use powerful GPU servers for scientific applications, and in particular to use mixed precision algorithms for problems that require high accuracy. That is, when possible, use low precision for speed, but mix in high precision computations when needed to maintain accuracy. Although previous work has been done for certain core linear algebra computations, relatively little has been done to exploit and understand the implications of using mixed precision arithmetic for the more challenging class of ill-posed problems.  The focus of this work is on developing methods for this frontier, so that efficient solvers can take advantage of modern GPUs with mixed precision computing capabilities.  Special considerations, which normally do not arise when solving well-conditioned problems, need to be considered.  Applications in machine learning, image restoration and image reconstruction, including breast imaging, will be used as target test problems, but an important aim of this work is to construct a computational platform that can be used to efficiently compute approximate solutions of large scale ill-posed inverse problems in a variety of applications. By developing a flexible and adaptable computational platform, the work produced from this project aims to have a broad scientific impact for applications where it is necessary to compute solutions of large-scale inverse problems with regularization, including astronomy, cosmology, geophysics, machine learning, microscopy, and medical imaging. Students and postdocs will be trained as part of this project.  <br/><br/>The potential for much faster computations has fueled a growing interest in the last decade to use powerful GPU servers for scientific applications, and in particular to use mixed precision algorithms for problems that require high accuracy; that is, when possible, use low precision for speed, but mix in high precision computations to improve accuracy. Recent previous work to develop mixed precision computational approaches for scientific applications have focused on general, well-conditioned linear systems, including iterative refinement, Cholesky factorization and least squares problems, QR factorization, and GMRES. The aim of this project is to focus on the development of mixed precision computations for the more challenging class of large-scale ill-posed inverse problems.  The approach will use a combination of operator approximation, using a low precision truncated singular value decomposition with iterative refinement exploiting mixed precision formats to ensure sufficient accuracy, or as preconditioners in Krylov subspace iterative methods. In addition, mixed precision, possibly with iterative refinement, will be applied within flexible and/or inexact hybrid Krylov subspace methods to reduce storage requirements and computational costs that increase at each iteration. The methods developed in this project can be used as tools to obtain approximate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems, or as solvers in machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nucleic acids play a critical role in information storage and catalysis within cells and the ability to control these functions can significantly advance the study of important biological questions, such as when and how nucleic acids are sequestered in cellular compartments known as biomolecular condensates. Methods exist for controlling nucleic acid function, but still have limitations with regard to what types of nucleic acids can be caged and the time scales for decaging and restoration of activity. The Heemstra lab has found that glyoxal provides a versatile and cost-effective approach to addressing many of these limitations, and the proposed research will explore new methods for achieving additional control over the location of caging and speed of reactivation. These methods will subsequently be applied to study the trafficking of short RNAs to biomolecular condensates. The proposed research will positively impact society by advancing biotechnologies by addressing fundamental questions related to the development of nucleic acid sensors and new potential approaches to gene editing. The research has the potential to provide tools to study the role of biomolecular condensates in neurodegenerative diseases such as myotonic dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This project will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by providing professional development and educational resources to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this proposal is to explore glyoxal and related analogues for selective caging and stimuli-responsive decaging of nucleic acids. Achieving temporal control over the structure and function of nucleic acids would provide a powerful tool to study their properties in vitro with the goal of deploying such methods in living cells to study biological function. While numerous caging methods have been reported, significant limitations remain with regard to the types of nucleic acids that can be caged and the time scales upon which they can be reactivated. The approach taken here, using glyoxal, is distinct from other approaches in that it enables post-synthetic caging of nucleic acids through reaction with the Watson-Crick-Franklin face of nucleobases. This temporarily disrupts base-pairing, leading to denaturation of structure and loss of function. Conveniently, caged oligonucleotides are stable at room temperature, but caging is reversed over hours to days at physiological temperature. We propose to further develop this approach and apply our method to understand the role of RNA in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form biomolecular condensates. Specifically, we will pursue the following three objectives in parallel: (1) Develop ?chemical lithography? for selective caging of specific segments of long RNAs; (2) Explore modified bis-aldehyde reagents for nucleobase cloaking of DNA and XNAs; (3) Utilize glyoxal-caging to study the role of snRNA structure and protein binding in the formation and RNA trafficking of Cajal bodies. The proposed research is expected to benefit society by providing tools to advance biotechnology and through the creation and dissemination of educational and professional development resources for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One central theme in analytic number theory is to understand the distribution of primes numbers, a topic that has important applications in cryptography, coding theory, and financial security. It is a field that is currently experiencing intensive progress, in sometimes unexpected directions. In recent years, many important classical questions have seen spectacular advances based on new techniques; conversely, methods developed in analytic number theory have led to the solution of striking problems in other fields. The main goal of this research project is to make progress on the distributional properties of primes and other related arithmetic objects, by developing further the classical analytic tools and the more modern additive combinatorial tools, and by understanding how to effectively combine these two different tools together. It is hoped that the need for stronger results to cater for applications in analytic number theory will drive the development of additive combinatorics, and vice versa. The grant will also be used to help train graduate students in the area.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will continue his work surrounding additive problems with primes. These works will involve developing both analytic tools and combinatorial tools. On the analytic side, the PI will continue to investigate the theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt function, which are higher-order extensions to classical exponential sum estimates involving these functions. On the combinatorial side, the PI expects to develop tools from additive combinatorics for locating arithmetic structures within dense sets of integers and discover new mechanisms for using them to exhibit such structures in the primes. The additive combinatorial ideas behind these tools, such as pseudorandomness and Gowers uniformity norms, have a strong link with topics in theoretical computer science such as extractors and expanders, property testing, and error-correcting codes. The PI plans to explore these links in this project. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Combinatorics program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of advanced light sources has contributed to significant progress in science and technology across many disciplines.

Light at these extreme energies can be used in fundamental studies, such as matter-antimatter production and understanding of astrophysical multi-messenger sources, and in applications to nuclear material detection, nuclear waste analysis, and medical isotope production.  The aim of this project is to demonstrate efficient gamma-ray generation using ultra-high-intensity lasers at the Extreme Light Infrastructure Beamlines (ELI-Beamlines) facility in the Czech Republic. This collaboration, enabled by the partnership between NSF and the Czech Science Foundation (GACR), combines the required theoretical expertise from UCSD, experimental expertise from ELI-Beamlines, and target fabrication expertise from General Atomics. In addition to graduate student training, the project will also provide dedicated summer internships to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>The emission of high-energy photons, a million times higher than visible-light, will be achieved by driving a multi-GigaGauss quasi-static azimuthal magnetic field inside a dense plasma that is rendered transparent by an ultra-high-intensity laser pulse. Plasma electrons serve as a mediator in the conversion of laser energy into a dense beam of energetic gamma-rays. The confining azimuthal magnetic field facilitates electron energy gain from the laser, while the electron deflections within the magnetic field cause the electrons to emit MeV gamma-rays in the direction of laser propagation. The extreme magnetic field strength and high electron energy ensure high efficiency of gamma-ray emission. The experiments will be performed at the ELI-Beamlines laser facility in the Czech Republic. The ability of these lasers to reach ultra-high on-target intensity is the key to accessing the desired regime. The experiments will utilize low-mass foam targets to produce a dense plasma whose electron density is well above the classical cutoff density, but below the relativistically adjusted cutoff density for the laser intensities used in the experiments.

The intense heat moves out the otherwise immobile internal defects and thus improves the properties. The same principle is used today. For example, steel processing requires temperatures in excess of 800 ?C applied for many hours. This research project aims to transform the current state-of-the-art by asking the question, can metals be processed at room temperature? The hypothesis is that, by passing high current - but not allowing the temperature to rise, a purely mechanical force can be generated inside the material. This force can make the defects mobile without raising the temperature and in a timeframe of minutes only. Accordingly, the objective of this research is to understand how the electrons (from current flow) interact with the defects, and how the elimination or rearrangement of defects is different from conventional heat treatment. These experiments are performed inside high magnification microscopes to develop fundamental insights of the proposed process.  Accomplishment of this project will give a new alternative to the metallic processing industry, which consumes a big portion of US energy (and carbon) footprint. The new science can also be employed in other systems where current can be passed, like electronics. By bypassing high temperature, this new process may impact the economy of manufacturing industry. The immediate impact is education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, while promoting diversity. The project involves student from middle school to enhance awareness of the carbon economy of manufacturing, and underlying science, to the next generation.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Defect and microstructural control in metals and alloys require very high temperature (comparable to melting point) and long times (from few hours to days). In this project, the PIs propose a non-thermal force to achieve the same effects in minutes. Here, electrical current is passed through the specimen, while controlling its temperature to the ambient. Whenever the electrons collide with defects and grain boundaries, they lose the momentum ? generating the ?electron wind force? (EWF). The hypothesis is that the EWF dissociates immobile and complex defects species to create very high density of disentangled and mobile dislocations. This allows the EWF to impart high mobility to the defects without raising the temperature. The specific objectives of this project are to (a) provide direct evidence of defect and microstructural control by performing fundamental experiments inside microscopes with near-atomic resolution and (b) investigate the electron-defect interaction to predict the evolution of various defect species (vacancies, partials, dislocations, twins) and correlate that to the microstructural changes. The transformative aspect of this project is the departure from centuries-old heat treatment techniques to the proposed non-thermal process. It explores the atomic to grain level fundamentals of defect-EWF interaction, which remain mostly unknown. The research is integrated with undergraduate education through Senior Capstone design course to train the next generation with emerging manufacturing technology. A student recruitment is through the Penn State Minority/Women in Engineering program. A unique outreach program, Print with Metals, is developed for Middle school students. These activities are complemented by the Manufacturing Day event to draw high and middle school students towards engineering, and specifically next generation manufacturing careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The application of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasmas ? which are highly reactive and can be used for applications ranging from water purification and clean energy technology to sterilization ? can at times be limited by requiring exotic, expensive, or bulky electronics and circuits for their operation. Piezoelectric materials could relax the need for high-end power supplies by using mechanical motion to produce the plasma forming piezoelectric stimulated plasma sources. The key feature of a piezoelectric stimulated plasma source is that the piezoelectric material is capable of high voltage gain and possesses high dielectric permittivity, enabling direct formation of a plasma at the piezoelectric surface. Current understanding of the interaction between piezoelectric materials and plasmas is very limited and there are unanswered fundamental questions about the coupling between the dynamics of the solid phase piezoelectric and plasma processes. The research project will provide understanding of a new area of plasma science that can be translated to sensor, biomedical, chemical, fluid dynamics, and materials applications.

These articulatory habits differ between individuals, and across languages and dialects of the same language, accounting for many aspects of foreign accent, speech disorders and speaking style.  Whereas previous studies of these habits have required specialized equipment for the immediate observation of articulator movements, the aim of this project is to develop and improve a tool for ""speech inversion""--that is, a tool that can accurately recover articulatory movements directly from the acoustic speech signal using machine learning methods.  To date, the tool developed by the project team has successfully recovered movements of the tongue and lips; the current project extends the tool?s functionality to encompass nasality (soft palate) and voicing (glottis).  Training and validation of the extended system will proceed using a newly collected corpus of acoustic and articulatory data drawn from speakers of American English.  This corpus, comprising co-collected audio, nasal, voicing, and articulatory movement, will serve as 'ground truth' for training and assessing the capabilities of the fully trained speech inversion system.  As a further test, we will test it against ground truth data from speakers of languages with patterns of articulatory habits known to differ from English.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and refine a Speech Inversion Tool that 'reads' acoustic recordings of speech and 'recovers' details of the magnitude and timing of articulatory movements.  The project aims to accomplish this goal by training specialized Neural Network models to relate features of the acoustic signal to separately acquired ground-truth nasal vs. oral outflow signals and concurrent electroglottography. Training data derives from native speakers of English; validation and tests for generalization include productions of speakers of Canadian French and Russian. When successfully validated, the resulting speech inversion tool will be useful for identifying medical issues that affect speech movement organization, such as the well-known disruption of oral/laryngeal timing in speakers with dysarthria. In addition, incorporating estimates of articulation may also aid in the tracking of changes resulting from medical conditions such as depression and schizophrenia.  More generally, the ability to rapidly and easily analyze articulatory movements obtained from audio recordings alone has the potential substantially improve Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, and to assist scholars, forensic scientists, and clinical professionals studying the speech of communities under field conditions in rural or under-resourced areas, and to help in the documentation of endangered languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

State-of-the-art techniques developed in the Bush lab enable new measurements of the interactions and structures of biological molecules in solution. These measurements address unmet needs for the rapid characterization of biological molecules and biological materials, including their assembly, heterogeneity, quality, and similarity. These measurements will help answer important questions about the structure and function of proteins and protein complexes, important for understanding the molecular basis for human diseases and developing therapeutics. Undergraduate and graduate students working in the Bush lab are trained in measurement science, data science, and technical communication, which prepares them for success in a wide variety of careers that increase the economic competitiveness of the United States.<br/><br/>There are unmet needs for measurements that probe protein equilibria and dynamics in solution, especially methods that are fast, sensitive, and tolerant of sample heterogeneity. Native ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry (MS) has many attributes that make it well positioned to fulfill these unmet needs. However, concerns about differences between equilibrium properties determined using solution- and gas-phase measurements reduces the confidence in native IM-MS data and inhibits the broader adoption of these technologies. This research addresses these unmet needs by (1) using, characterizing, and controlling the electrochemically-induced changes to samples concomitant with electrospray ionization; (2) facilitating the broader adoption of negative ion electrospray ionization for native IM-MS; and (3) using variable-temperature electrospray ionization to rapidly characterize thermal profiles and the extent to which protein folding is reversible. This in turn will enable native IM-MS to play a greater role in biophysics and structural biology, which will contribute to new knowledge of biological processes and cures for human disease.

At the heart of this interplay is the theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, where one can produce manifolds via the actions of discrete groups on associated homogeneous spaces. Of particular interest are discrete groups acting isometrically on hyperbolic space. These actions play a fundamental role in low dimensional geometry and topology via geometrization, and have provided the impetus for much current research in geometric group theory and the deformation theory of geometric structures. Among the discrete subgroups of simple Lie groups more generally, arithmetic lattices play a central role, utilizing technology from algebraic/analytic number theory and the theory of algebraic groups. These interactions provide deep and important connections between the geometry of the associated spaces and the algebra of the arithmetic lattices. All these interactions have driven mathematical research for more than one hundred years, and this conference will bring together researchers from these areas and closely related fields to search for new and exciting connections for the future.

The application of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasmas ? which are highly reactive and can be used for applications ranging from water purification and clean energy technology to sterilization ? can at times be limited by requiring exotic, expensive, or bulky electronics and circuits for their operation. Piezoelectric materials could relax the need for high-end power supplies by using mechanical motion to produce the plasma forming piezoelectric stimulated plasma sources. The key feature of a piezoelectric stimulated plasma source is that the piezoelectric material is capable of high voltage gain and possesses high dielectric permittivity, enabling direct formation of a plasma at the piezoelectric surface. Current understanding of the interaction between piezoelectric materials and plasmas is very limited and there are unanswered fundamental questions about the coupling between the dynamics of the solid phase piezoelectric and plasma processes. The research project will provide understanding of a new area of plasma science that can be translated to sensor, biomedical, chemical, fluid dynamics, and materials applications.  As such, this collaborative project between the University of South Carolina and the University of Notre Dame is being supported under the ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) program.<br/><br/>Fundamental understanding of piezoelectric stimulated plasma sources will be advanced through combined and cohesive modeling and experimental efforts. A new multi-physics modeling framework, benchmarked against experiments, will be developed that resolves both the solid phase piezoelectric material and gas phase plasma in a fully integrated fashion that is currently not available. Understanding at a fundamental level will help advance the understanding of plasma-surface interactions that is important to a large variety of plasma devices. The outcomes of this effort are expected to be a major leap in predictive modeling and transformative knowledge on piezoelectric stimulated non-thermal plasma discharges, outreach to the global plasma community through focused virtual workshops, YouTube-based short video modules on piezoelectric direct plasma discharges, and student exchange and outreach activities to inspire under-represented students and the general public towards STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These articulatory habits differ between individuals, and across languages and dialects of the same language, accounting for many aspects of foreign accent, speech disorders and speaking style.  Whereas previous studies of these habits have required specialized equipment for the immediate observation of articulator movements, the aim of this project is to develop and improve a tool for ""speech inversion""--that is, a tool that can accurately recover articulatory movements directly from the acoustic speech signal using machine learning methods.  To date, the tool developed by the project team has successfully recovered movements of the tongue and lips; the current project extends the tool?s functionality to encompass nasality (soft palate) and voicing (glottis).  Training and validation of the extended system will proceed using a newly collected corpus of acoustic and articulatory data drawn from speakers of American English.  This corpus, comprising co-collected audio, nasal, voicing, and articulatory movement, will serve as 'ground truth' for training and assessing the capabilities of the fully trained speech inversion system.  As a further test, we will test it against ground truth data from speakers of languages with patterns of articulatory habits known to differ from English.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and refine a Speech Inversion Tool that 'reads' acoustic recordings of speech and 'recovers' details of the magnitude and timing of articulatory movements.  The project aims to accomplish this goal by training specialized Neural Network models to relate features of the acoustic signal to separately acquired ground-truth nasal vs. oral outflow signals and concurrent electroglottography. Training data derives from native speakers of English; validation and tests for generalization include productions of speakers of Canadian French and Russian. When successfully validated, the resulting speech inversion tool will be useful for identifying medical issues that affect speech movement organization, such as the well-known disruption of oral/laryngeal timing in speakers with dysarthria. In addition, incorporating estimates of articulation may also aid in the tracking of changes resulting from medical conditions such as depression and schizophrenia.  More generally, the ability to rapidly and easily analyze articulatory movements obtained from audio recordings alone has the potential substantially improve Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, and to assist scholars, forensic scientists, and clinical professionals studying the speech of communities under field conditions in rural or under-resourced areas, and to help in the documentation of endangered languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ubiquitin is a regulatory protein that is found in most tissues of organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus.  Essentially, this protein is present in many large single-celled organisms and all known non-microscopic organisms.  Replicating the chemical structure and function of ubiquitin is very complex and tedious task because the synthetic approach would require connecting 76 amino acids in a very precise and sequence-controlled manner.  In order to mimic the structural complexity of ubiquitin, this project will utilize folding of synthetic polymers with sequences and secondary structures resembling those found in the protein.  Block copolymers will be prepared through a combination of covalent and noncovalent chemistries.  The two distinct strategies outlined in the project will circumvent folding complications while allowing observation of the interplay of different and well-defined macromolecular elements.  The research associated with this project could move the science of polymer-based foldamers to the next level and enable systematic studies of larger assemblies of synthetic analogs of proteins and enzymes.  This could in turn lead to the development of novel and controlled three-dimensional architectures as key polymeric materials for electrooptical, biological, biomedical, sensing and computer-based applications.  The research team will host monthly K-12 inner city school children and introduce them to the excitement of materials chemistry through basic hands-on experiments and demonstrations.  An outreach activity ?STEM Job Shadowing Experience? with all-girls Mrs. Porter boarding high school will expose underrepresented minorities and female students to exciting career opportunities. <br/><br/>Creating artificial proteins and enzymes based on synthetic polymers containing carbon-carbon bond-based backbones that rival nature?s machinery regarding activity and selectivity and to employ these three-dimensional architectures as materials for important applications has long been a challenge in macromolecular chemistry.  This project will focus on the synthesis and folding of poly(aryl isocyanide)s and poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s as structural analogs of the small protein ubiquitin.  Two distinct strategies will be employed.  The first one will be used to emulate the main structural elements of ubiquitin, while the second strategy will focus on the sequences of the secondary structures of the protein.  (Co)polymers will be prepared using a suite of polymerization techniques including reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and Pd-alkyne initiated living polymerization of isocyanides.  The folded protein-like architectures will be characterized by a battery of techniques including NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopies, X-ray and light scattering techniques, AFM, and STEM.  This project will create a new class of synthetic analogs of proteins and advance polymer methodology by introducing new strategies towards block copolymers with well-defined secondary structures, telechelic and heterotelechelic block copolymers, and functional poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s.  Additionally, the results associated with this work have the potential to increase the understanding of the interplay of orthogonal noncovalent interactions to fold synthetic polymers into three-dimensional architectures and the properties of the resulting nanostructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

James Schuck of Columbia University is studying the photon avalanching behavior in lanthanide-based nanoparticles.  When nanoparticles absorb light of one color, they often emit light of another color, in a process known as photoluminescence. In most cases, the intensity of the photoluminescence scales with the intensity of the exciting light. Double the light and photoluminescence is twice as bright. However, that is not always the case. Sometimes the absorption of light can make a nanoparticle more likely to absorb more light. In these cases, the brightness of the photoluminescence would more than double when the intensity of the exciting light doubles. This property is known as photon avalanching, and it could be used in a variety of emerging applications.  However, there are only a few examples of substances that exhibit photon avalanching behavior and much remains to be learned about this unusual property. Professor Schuck and his students will use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to unlock fundamental insights about what controls the photon avalanching in these unique nanostructures. Their discoveries could impact technologies ranging from efficient upconverting lasers and image processing to infrared quantum counting, solid-state lighting and broadband photonics, all of which rely on rapid and energy efficient light-material interactions. The project will also promote STEM education, engaging graduate, undergraduate, and underrepresented high school students through research and teaching activities highlighting non-traditional links between chemistry and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>This project aims to fundamentally understand and develop new avalanching nanoparticles through a synergistic effort that combines advanced characterization, theoretical modeling, precision synthesis and hierarchical nanoparticle design. Avalanching nanoparticles will be investigated using single-particle imaging and optical spectroscopy approaches, revealing critical mechanistic parameters and essential links that define, and ultimately limit, the photon avalanching response in this new class of materials. In addition, improved models of photon avalanching in nanoparticles will be developed, enabling the quantitative derivation of the roles of distinct energy transfer (ET) processes and recombination pathways ? and the prediction of nanochemistry-dependent avalanching properties ? when combined with our experimental measurements.

The use of data has become an essential part of the modern decision-making process. It is imperative that students learn how to analyze and reason about data. Visualization has become an essential method for analyzing and understanding data. Educators currently lack the tools that allow them to effectively teach students how to visualize data. The goal of this project is to develop a software tool, VisSymphony, that will allow instructors to create and moderate visualization-related classroom activities. To promote active learning, instructors will be able to provide real-time feedback to students, and the system will provide immediate feedback on student submissions. The project team plans to work together with partnering instructors to design the tool and to collect and analyze data to understand the effectiveness of the tool.<br/>  <br/>This project intends to address two significant issues in visualization education: (1) The need for software tools that help students learn visualization design theories and principles, and (2) The lack of understanding of how classroom orchestration can improve visualization education and prepare students for the workforce. By evaluating how VisSymphony impacts the educational experience, the investigators hope to learn about how classroom orchestration can be operationalized to effectively teach and learn about visualization. The research team will use a two-cycle coding technique. In the first cycle of coding, the project team will use an open/initial coding method and in the second cycle use a pattern coding method. The team will then apply statistical tests to the coded data to understand how VisSymphony affects the visualization education experience. VisSymphony?s development and refinement will follow a participatory design approach utilizing community feedback to create a flexible tool for education. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By analogy to the rock-paper-scissors game, the investigators will use colloidal nanoparticles (i.e., rocks) to template the formation of molybdenum sulfide sheets (i.e., paper) on specific sections of the nanoparticle. Instead of scissors, the proposed synthesis approach leverages the well-defined nanoparticle shape (e.g., truncated cubes) to define the geometry of the particle-sheet composite. This project will have significant broader impact beyond the creation of new knowledge of scientific and societal importance, potentially leading to the development of new nanostructured composite materials with unique optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. Graduate students will receive extensive training and experience at the confluence of material fabrication and characterization approaches to investigate, understand and predict the formation of composite nanostructures. Outreach and education are closely integrated with the scientific work. The investigators will develop a ?back-to-the-future? workshop to engage participants by developing their vision for the future of their specific research field, the broader technological implications, and their personal roles and opportunities in bringing this future to fruition. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The overarching objective of the proposed project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, is to establish the foundational synthesis/structure relationship of molybdenum/lead chalcogenide quantum dot mesocrystals. Mesocrystals are defined as assemblies of smaller constituent crystals arranged with high degree of translational and orientational ordering in their superlattice sites. Access to colloidal quantum dot (QD) building blocks with precisely defined size, shape, and composition as well as concurrent progress in understanding of and control over directed assembly and attachment have enabled remarkable advances in QD mesocrystals. Currently available QD mesocrystals are limited to single composition structures, yet the scientific and technological evolution of isolated QDs has taught us that moving from single-components to multi-composition heterostructures (e.g., core-shell or Janus-like) introduces advanced and programmable functionalities. The PI has identified the synthesis and analysis of heterostructured QD mesocrystals as a scientifically interesting and technologically important research challenge. The PI embraces the challenge of establishing processing/structure relationships as an opportunity to closely integrate synthesis, assembly, and materials characterization. The proposal presents a hypothesis-driven approach with three complementary objectives focused on formation of facet-specific PbX-(MoS2)m misfit layer heterostructures, and directed assembly of isolated PbX-(MoS2)m into a new class of superstructures. The proposed research presents an exciting opportunity to significantly improve upon the knowledge of QD mesocrystals with properties by design. The goals of the proposed research are ambitious, and the generated knowledge will significantly advance basic understanding, design, predictability and control over heterostructured QD mesocrystals with compelling far-reaching prospects for future advances in electrocatalysis and optoelectronics<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These articulatory habits differ between individuals, and across languages and dialects of the same language, accounting for many aspects of foreign accent, speech disorders and speaking style.  Whereas previous studies of these habits have required specialized equipment for the immediate observation of articulator movements, the aim of this project is to develop and improve a tool for ""speech inversion""--that is, a tool that can accurately recover articulatory movements directly from the acoustic speech signal using machine learning methods.  To date, the tool developed by the project team has successfully recovered movements of the tongue and lips; the current project extends the tool?s functionality to encompass nasality (soft palate) and voicing (glottis).  Training and validation of the extended system will proceed using a newly collected corpus of acoustic and articulatory data drawn from speakers of American English.  This corpus, comprising co-collected audio, nasal, voicing, and articulatory movement, will serve as 'ground truth' for training and assessing the capabilities of the fully trained speech inversion system.  As a further test, we will test it against ground truth data from speakers of languages with patterns of articulatory habits known to differ from English.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and refine a Speech Inversion Tool that 'reads' acoustic recordings of speech and 'recovers' details of the magnitude and timing of articulatory movements.  The project aims to accomplish this goal by training specialized Neural Network models to relate features of the acoustic signal to separately acquired ground-truth nasal vs. oral outflow signals and concurrent electroglottography. Training data derives from native speakers of English; validation and tests for generalization include productions of speakers of Canadian French and Russian. When successfully validated, the resulting speech inversion tool will be useful for identifying medical issues that affect speech movement organization, such as the well-known disruption of oral/laryngeal timing in speakers with dysarthria. In addition, incorporating estimates of articulation may also aid in the tracking of changes resulting from medical conditions such as depression and schizophrenia.  More generally, the ability to rapidly and easily analyze articulatory movements obtained from audio recordings alone has the potential substantially improve Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, and to assist scholars, forensic scientists, and clinical professionals studying the speech of communities under field conditions in rural or under-resourced areas, and to help in the documentation of endangered languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, wildfires are now the most prevalent type of natural disaster in the southwestern U.S. and are detrimental to human health and ecosystem services (including water availability, visibility, and recreation).  The Harnessing the Data Revolution for Fire Science (HDRFS) project aims to understand the ?wildland fire continuum,? the process in which an ecosystem?s pre-fire state (plant community composition, ecology, hydrological state, etc.) determines the level of fuel buildup and thereby helps determine the conditions of the eventual wildfire.  Post-fire recovery in turn sets the initial condition for establishing the pre-fire state for the next fire in the cycle.  The HDRFS research and capacity-building program is organized around interconnected elements of the wildland fire continuum and aligned efforts in research computing and data. Along with its research and capacity-building agenda, the HDRFS project includes an ambitious education and workforce development focus aimed at expanding opportunities for Nevadans at the K-12 and community college levels.  HDRFS is administered by the Nevada System for Higher Education in collaboration with the University of Nevada, Reno; the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and the Desert Research Institute. Additional institutions involved include Nevada State College and four community colleges (College of Southern Nevada, Truckee Meadows Community College, Western Nevada College, and Great Basin College).  <br/><br/>Harnessing the Data Revolution for Fire Science (HDRFS) will explore the fire continuum of diverse processes interacting across scales in the sagebrush ecosystem. Goals include: 1) improving understanding of fire processes and effects over spatial scales; 2) determining fire?s interactions with carbon cycling, water balance, fuel buildup, and invasive species; 3) increasing our mechanistic understanding of fire-induced soil hydrophobicity and its influence on hydrology; 4) improving models of fire processes and eco-hydrological fire effects; 5) improving characterization and modeling of fire emissions and their aging; 6) adapting aerial robots for greatly improved data collection under hazardous or challenging conditions (e.g., characterizing smoke plumes, fire processes, and ecohydrology); and 7) developing computer vision/machine learning data fusion to process and assimilate multisensory data into fire and ecosystem models. HDRFS research will contribute to understanding the spatial scaling of fire processes and effects over ~eight orders of magnitude in area, with the goal of using laboratory and other small-scale results for predicting and modeling large scale wildland fire processes and effects.  In parallel with its research and capacity-building program, HDRFS will also engage students, educators, and practitioners via a series of outreach and workforce development activities aimed at achieving a more diverse, STEM-capable population and workforce in Nevada.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Martin St. Maurice from Marquette University, Lawrence Wackett from University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and Betsy Martinez-Vaz from Hamline University are studying the enzymes and metabolic pathways that microbes use to degrade guanide and biguanide compounds that are commonly found in fertilizers, fuel propellants and pharmaceuticals. The most notable example is the biguanide drug metformin, which represents the fourth most prescribed pharmaceutical on the planet. Metformin is entering wastewater treatment plants at an alarming rate, with no clear sense of how it is being degraded by microorganisms. Using detailed studies of enzyme structure/function, chemical biology, comparative genomics and microbiology, this project aims to identify the metabolic pathway(s) and characterize the bacterial enzymes responsible for biodegrading metformin and related guanide and biguanide compounds. This project is expected to provide useful data to assist scientists and engineers in the development of better bioremediation practices in municipal water treatment plants where metformin is a major entering chemical. Further, this project integrates teaching, mentorship and training across three universities by incorporating the proposed research directly into graduate training, multi-institutional undergraduate courses, career mentorship and summer internships, significantly broadening the impact of the project.<br/><br/>This project seeks to generate a comprehensive description of the metabolic pathways that are available naturally for the degradation of guanidinium compounds by microbial species and their relevant enzymes in wastewater and also in the human gut environment. The central metabolic artery includes the combined activities of guanylurea hydrolase, guanidine carboxylase, carboxyguanidine deiminase and allophanate hydrolase. The molecular contributions to the substrate selectivity of guanidine carboxylase will be characterized by x-ray crystallography and enzyme kinetic analysis. The structure and function of the carboxyguanidine deiminase enzyme will be examined by investigating the mechanism of catalysis, the functional role of the subunits and the potential for substrate channeling. The pathway and enzyme(s) responsible for bacterial metformin degradation will be identified by a combination of enzyme isolation, purification, and comparative genomics, across potentially relevant bacterial species,  followed by detailed structural and functional characterization of the metformin-degrading enzyme(s).

This project will study shell formation in an important marine organism, the foraminifera. Foraminifera are sand-grain-sized, shell-forming plankton. They are common in the modern ocean and in the fossil record. Their shell composition depends on ocean conditions during growth, and so their fossils are used to record Earth?s climate history. Foraminifera shells also play an important role in the carbon cycle. They are responsible for up to 80% of the carbon that is deposited on the seafloor. Understanding shell formation is important because changes in ocean warming and pH threatens foraminiferal survival. However, foraminiferal shell formation is not well understood. In part this is because the genome for these species is unknown. A genome is required to identify proteins responsible for shell forming processes. This study will close this knowledge gap by identifying key shell proteins in two species. The project will grow specimens under conditions that mimic likely future climate and will identify differences in shell proteins in response to growth conditions. The results will provide a 'blueprint for shell formation' in foraminifera. The genome and protein sequence datasets will be useful to researchers in marine biology and chemistry, evolution, climate science, and material science. Broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate student field research experience and training. International participants will also gain experience growing foraminifera in the laboratory.<br/><br/><br/>This multidisciplinary project will establish the molecular biological controls of biomineralization in two model species of single-celled foraminifera. This is crucial for quantifying the marine calcite budget and assessing the impact of calcification feedbacks on future atmospheric carbon dioxide, as well as producing accurate interpretation of the foraminiferal shell geochemical archive that underpins future climate change projections. Despite decades of research into how foraminifera biomineralization, our understanding lags far behind other marine calcifiers, owing to a lack of genome/transcriptome information that is vital for identification of foraminifera shell matrix proteins (SMPs). SMPs in the shell?s organic matrix layers trigger nucleation of calcium carbonate and are responsible for shell formation and its geochemical properties. The identification of SMPs will aid in our understanding of how biomineralization will respond to future environmental change and thus it is imperative that we resolve biomineralization mechanisms in these critically important marine calcifiers. This project addresses that need. The interdisciplinary team?s expertise will be capitalized to produce the genome and transcriptome data required via Single Cell Sequencing and exploit innovative high throughput microfluidic approaches to identify and characterize key SMPs in foraminifera biomineralization. Foraminifera culturing experiments will be conducted to investigate molecular/protein responses to different climate scenarios. The project team combines a unique set of skills that enable us, for the first time, to investigate all aspects of the biological control of the biomineralization process within the foraminifera.

These ripples in the very fabric of space and time are produced when the densest objects in the Universe -- such as black holes and neutron stars -- orbit and collide. The detection of gravitational waves by the NSF-funded LIGO and European Virgo collaborations has opened up a new window on the Universe, revealing previously invisible events like pairs of black holes merging. Researchers supported by this award will participate in the analysis of gravitational waves as members of the LIGO collaboration, helping to infer the properties of the sources of these ripples. In addition to these collaboration activities, which have far-reaching impacts on astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics, the research group will carry out searches for new physics using gravitational-wave data. Detections of gravitational waves provide information about spacetime at its most dynamic, allowing for strong-field tests of relativity, as the possibility of detecting extremely compact objects which are otherwise invisible to electromagnetic observations. This award will enable both searches for gravitational waves from new, hypothetical compact stars, and use the final ""ringdown"" of merged black holes to search for new physics. These research activities will provide training for graduate students in modeling and data analysis, skillsets which are in great demand and of great benefit to society. In addition, members of the group will engage in outreach activities in order to educate and inspire the public about this new field of physics and astronomy.<br/><br/>In particular, this project focuses on searching for new physics with gravitational wave detections, while continuing to support the LIGO Scientific Collaboration by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on detections made in the collaboration's next observing campaign. The PI and other members of the group will participate in the planning and development of parameter estimation pipelines, and carry out  inferences on detections made in low latency. These inferences are a crucial first step in the use of gravitational waves for understanding the populations of compact objects, inferring the nuclear equation of state from observations of binary neutron stars, testing the theory of relativity, and using gravitational waves to measure cosmic expansion. The project will also include the development of accurate, reduced-dimensional waveform models to enable the search for low-mass compact objects with large spin-induced quadrupole moments. Such hypothetical objects can be missed by current searches, and their detection would reveal exotic new physics. The GstLAL search pipeline and random template banks will be used to carry out searches for these systems in publicly available data. The team will also use methods borrowed from quantum mechanical perturbation theory to predict how possible deviations from relativity are imprinted on the ringdown spectrum of spinning black holes. After predicting the changes to the spectrum from particular deviations, Bayesian parameter estimation will be used to constrain or measure the underlying parameters of these models using ringdown signals from previously detected binary black hole mergers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At its best, aquaponics allows local people to produce their own fresh fish and produce in a sustainable manner: the wastewater from the fish is used to provide water and fertilizer to the plants. However, there are significant technological and social barriers that have hindered adoption of aquaponics by marginalized populations living in food deserts. Barriers include 1) systems that are prone to instability without advanced technical knowledge, 2) fish and produce quality that do not meet consumer quality demands (e.g. muddy fish flavor), and 3) food safety issues given that pathogens in the fish wastewater can contaminate the vegetables. Failure to address these three issues will continue to place aquaponics systems (and the corresponding nutritional and environmental benefits) out of reach of marginalized populations. The objective of this project is to improve understanding of how aquaponics design decisions affect stability, pathogen dynamics, and product quality. <br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this project is that algal biofloc and decoupled systems will exceed the performance metrics of bacteria-centric biofloc and coupled systems (85% of current systems) in terms of 1) system stability and ease of operation, 2) nutritional and flavor profiles, and 3) pathogen management when placed in the hands of novice users. This project will allow rigorous testing of integrating algal- biofloc and decoupled plant production into small-scale aquaponics systems, both independently and in combination. The test systems will be operated by high school students in East Alabama (after hands-on training) in a synergistic school-university partnership. The university team has extensive experience conducting research on aquaponics systems and algal-bacterial treatment of waste, and engages frequently in educational and outreach programs with novice users. The three specific research aims are to: (Aim 1) Test the integration of algae and decoupling into biofloc aquaponics to improve stability and ease of operation for novice users (high school students). The hypothesis is that integration of green algae into the biofloc and deployment into a decoupled aquaponics system will improve system stability (nitrification capacity) and reliability (plant and fish survival). (Aim 2) Determine the contribution of algal biofloc to improved nutritional quality and flavor profile of aquaponics products. The hypothesis is that integrating Chlorella algae into the biofloc will increase the omega-3 fatty acid profile of fish, antioxidant content of vegetables, and improve the fish flavor profile by displacing opportunistic bacteria and cyanobacteria species that generate muddy flavors. (Aim 3) Quantify the impacts of algal biofloc and decoupling on indicator pathogens in aquaponics. The hypothesis is that the presence of algal taxa like Chlorella in the biofloc and use of decoupled systems will reduce the presence of indicator pathogens. While students and teachers will run the different aquaponics systems, Auburn University and the Bashan Institute of Science will conduct advanced chemical, microbiological, and genomic analyses of the systems. Students, after formal parental informed consent, will evaluate system ease-of-use and flavor of products through surveys. Improved understanding of microbial dynamics in aquaponics can translate broadly to other areas of aquaculture, nutrient recovery, and waste management. Improved understanding of how design choices impact user experience may translate to research on other scalable food production technologies. The project is designed to lead to enhancement of education of high school student participants who live in low-income communities with limited food access. Approximately 225 students will engage in hands-on learning by operating the aquaponics systems, allowing them to learn and apply knowledge of agriculture, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and engineering. Potentially, these students can impact the future of sustainable food production: the skills that they learn should extend to a wide range of career and education pathways. It is expected that reaching them in their formative years will result in measurable changes in self- perceptions regarding STEM topics, which will be assessed through survey instruments.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ferromagnetic liquid droplets are liquid bodies that can take and sustain virtually any shape while in liquid environment and can transition between a non-magnetic object and a permanent magnet. These unique properties could find application in drug delivery, microfluidic channels, and actuators. Smart hydrogel sensors are envisioned for continuous health monitoring due to their biocompatibility and sensitivity to, e.g., water acidity, that enlarges or shrinks the hydrogel. Embedded magnetic nanoparticles undergo a phase transition that can be detected without the need for electric wires into or out of the human body. This project provides mentored research training and career development to graduate and undergraduate students and leverages institutional services to recruit underrepresented students. The principal investigator engages the science-curious public and high school students in the proposed research via existing university services, social media, local conferences, and National Science Foundation-funded outreach programs and integrates his findings into undergraduate and graduate courses. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Magnetic order by disorder is a complex non-trivial phenomenon that governs the transition between a vanishing (superparamagnetic) and a stable (ferromagnetic) magnetization with long-range, quasi-long-range, or short-range order. This complexity is even larger in liquid systems that undergo a reversible transformation between paramagnetic ferrofluid and ferromagnetic liquid by the assembly and jamming of superparamagnetic nanoparticles on curved liquid-liquid interfaces. The interfacial assembly is mediated by oppositely charged ligands that anchor the nanoparticles and reduce their electrostatic charge and spacing. The goal of this project is to determine design strategies for disordered ensembles of superparamagnetic nanostructures that combine reversible transformation between superparamagnetism and ferromagnetism with hard-magnetic properties. The principal investigator accomplishes this by studying the relationship between structural short-range order and magnetic properties in the dried state using nanoparticle assemblies and lithographically patterned nanostructures with different degrees of disorder, symmetry, layer thickness, and spacing and applying these findings to ferromagnetic liquid droplets. Through coordinated experimental and numerical studies using micromagnetic Monte Carlo simulations, magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and advanced x-ray and electron microscopies, the principal investigator corroborates or refutes the following three hypotheses: (1) Materials with increasing disorder favor a transition from ferromagnetism to non-collinear magnetization to superparamagnetism that is delayed in anisotropic arrangements; (2) Structural short-range order governing magnetic order can be inferred from macroscopic properties; and (3) In-field assembly and jamming of nanoparticles at liquid-liquid interfaces enable nanopatterning of the surfactants with an enhanced remanent magnetization and coercive field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main performance challenges in these systems is poor energy efficiency; they dissipate too much heat. Similarly, a major goal of chip design has been to minimize the heat dissipation of individual nanoscale components and/or to apply phenomenological laws to reduce the heat dissipation of the global architecture. However, theoretical computer science research has focused on the design of algorithms that minimize time and memory costs per computation. To date there has been little use of first principles of physics to analyze how the global structural organization of computers affects their heat dissipation. Thus, the goal of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of how the physical features of a distributed computational system (e.g., communication rates, network topology, and heterogeneity) affect its performance, specifically the relationship between its heat dissipation, space and time resource costs, robustness, speed, and computational power. Besides the technical work the project will also undertake: (i) outreach via new coursework in the context of this project, (ii) support of mentoring students/postdocs thereby increasing the pool of technically trained workforce, and (iii) public and media outreach for increasing public understanding of science.<br/><br/>This exploratory project will aim to start to fill this gap in scientific understanding by exploiting the recently developed tools of stochastic thermodynamics. The PI will use investigate how the following features of the global physical architecture of a computer affect its cost: (1) communication rate and accuracy of information transmission between subsystems, (2) characteristics of the network topology of the architecture, particularly hierarchy and modularity, (3) heterogeneity among the individual subsystems. Specifically, the project will investigate how these design features affect trade-offs between time, memory, and heat costs; desired computational capabilities; and robustness against environmental fluctuations or faulty subsystems.

This project supports fundamental research focused on creating better delivery agents that can better protect and carry the important nucleic acids like mRNA so it can do its job. We explore the use of exosomes as potential delivery vehicles.  Exosomes are essentially little compartments that are derived from our own cells. Because of this, they have key components that allow them to enter other cells and deliver cargo.  While exosomes have this unique advantage, loading them with the target therapeutic is challenging. To address this, the research team will develop small, charged proteins that can gently hold onto the negatively charged nucleic acids, which then helps improve the loading of exosomes.  This project will not only train the next generation graduate student and researcher in these new approaches, but also help inspire high school students as they will be able to carry out meaningful research experience both virtually and in person. Both the PI and co-PI have a strong record of training women and underrepresented minorities and plan to continue to recruit and train them as part of this work with the goal of developing and diversifying the future scientific workforce.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>Nucleic acids possess critical instructions for controlling biological processes with tangible implications in fundamental cell and organismal studies, biotechnology and medicine especially in light of delivery of vaccines for Covid-19. There is a need to develop a modular platform for the widespread delivery of nucleic acids, and exosomes have recently been identified as promising delivery agents. The mechanisms of assembly between membrane-derived lipids and recombinant proteins is poorly understood but provides an opportunity to optimize and explore the fundamental material properties of exosome-based delivery vehicles. The research team proposes to develop an engineered protein-exosome system or lipoproteoplex capable of: 1) encapsulating siRNA at a high efficiency into the exosome; 2) increasing siRNA release once inside the cell through increased endosomal escape; 3) performing efficient siRNA delivery with a favorable safety profile. For education and outreach, the team aims to focus on verified virtual platforms to provide students safe, meaningful research experiences.  Courses will focus on hybrid in-person and virtual lessons with an emphasis on group-based projects to facilitate active learning. For outreach, Dr. Montclare will participate in the Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE) program and engage local NYC 10th and 11th grade students in computational design of supercharged proteins. Dr. Rabbani will implement as part of the Wyss Sumer Research Fellowship, a biochemistry training that involves exosome preparation, characterization and use for transfection as well as recording protocol video and journal club discussion online.

Communities vary significantly between urban and rural settings in Kansas. Differences include social and economic needs; varying access to water, energy, and transportation; infrastructure conditions and investments; and natural hazards, such as floodplains. Community resources or capitals can help a community overcome, withstand, and recover from different disasters and hazards in the short and long term.

The development of this new US technology may directly impact public health, insurance companies, and the community by improving the safety of bicycle riders and reducing the economic burden of bike accidents and theft.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an accurate, versatile, and affordable bike location tracking, accident detection, and vital sign measurement system utilizing a variety of sensors on an internet-of-things (IoT)-based platform. The system is connected to the cloud via cellular services and sends real-time data that is acquired by the sensors to the cloud. The technology utilizes a novel algorithm to detect bike accidents and vital signs. The algorithm gathers data from the sensors, performs feature extraction, and applies machine learning algorithms to detect accidents and measure vital signs. In addition, the technology utilizes GPS location tracking to locate the exact location of the bike and sends the location to an emergency contact in case of an accident so that the rider can receive needed help as quickly as possible. The location tracking system also helps in locating stolen/lost bikes. The biosensors mounted on the bike handle can measure the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood oxygen level, and provide information for activity tracking, as well as detect arrhythmia or heart failure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interdisciplinary research proposed at Fisk University has the potential to advance our understanding of the interactions between biological systems and polymeric materials. Additionally, this project involves undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups in the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics fields. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will provide integrated research training to undergraduate students from multiple backgrounds, thereby exposing them to the multidisciplinary nature of state-of-the art polymer chemistry research.

The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that the chemical composition and network topology of polyglycidol-based hydrogels can be easily tuned to present multiple biophysical and biochemical cues simultaneously, which can then be used to regulate mesenchymal stem cells attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. To accomplish this goal, this project combines a selection of established synthetic protocols to produce a new facile methodology for the synthesis of topologically and compositionally unique polyglycidol-based hydrogels, unattainable with current poly(ethylene glycol)-based methodologies. The research team first investigates the influence of crosslink kinetics, network topology, and composition on the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogel network, then access the behavior of mesenchymal stem cells when incorporated into these polymeric networks, as a function of polymer topology and composition, using molecular and cell biology approaches. This approach allows the research team to establish structure-property-activity relationships between the biochemical and biophysical properties of the polymeric network and cellular responses. The facile modification of polyether-based networks to include multiple biophysical and biochemical properties represents a significant advance towards designing cell-scaffolds that can be used to gain fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects of these properties on cellular behavior, advancing the knowledge needed to influence cellular processes with synthetic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant advances in perception, planning, mapping, localization, and actuation over the past decade have accelerated the migration of robots from controlled laboratory environments to diverse applications in a complex and dynamic human world. The ability to effectively communicate has become increasingly important as robots transition from specialized applications performed in isolation to significant roles in human-robot teams.  While smart voice assistants have become prevalent in recent years due to advances in automatic speech recognition, those interactions are not conditioned on a model of the environment inferred from sensor observations and do not lead to the physical manipulation of their surroundings. Recent advances in grounded language communication for human-robot interaction, where speech and text both inform and guide a robot's understanding of and actions in the world, have transformed the limited space of concepts that robots and humans could exchange into rich representations that could be composed of many different objects, spatial relationships, planning constraints, and actions.  Point solutions with bespoke environment representations or models tailored to specific applications may exist, but no current approach is able to efficiently interpret the meaning of human instructions across many scenarios over non-trivial timescales.  Fundamentally new approaches to grounded language communication that fluidly reason about the past dynamics, present configuration and/or future state of objects from select observations are needed for collaborative robots to interpret linguistic interactions quickly and accurately in human-robot teams. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to revisit algorithms, models, and intelligence architectures for collaborative robots and reformulate how probabilistic graphical models are constructed and solved for efficient grounded language communication in environments with complex dynamics, non-trivial affordances, and rich semantic representations.<br/><br/>This research will investigate this topic by developing algorithms that address two critical technical gaps.  First, this research will develop algorithms that infer which past and/or present observations and/or future projections in time are needed to construct minimal but sufficient environment models for interpreting natural language.  Second, this research will develop algorithms that iteratively update their solutions based on minor modifications of the environment model and augmentation of symbolic representations from incrementally updating observations and environment projections.  These algorithms will enable a novel intelligence architecture for natural language symbol grounding that reasons about which observations and/or environment projections and what kinds of information are needed from these dynamic environment representations to enable scalable and capable models for grounded language communication with collaborative robots.  Experimental evaluation of these ideas will be performed on a variety of robot manipulators, field robots, and mobile manipulators in addition to purposefully built collaborative mobile robots that will be developed for teaching and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Providing this information has proved an immensely challenging measurement problem because snowflakes are delicate, they evaporate quickly, and their shapes and sizes are exceptionally varied depending on the conditions in which they formed. No weather or climate model currently accounts for how snowflakes swirl as they are buffeted by turbulence during their fall. This is largely because the settling of particles in a moving fluid remains unsolved, despite that fact that the problem has very general importance to a wide range of fields in the physical and biological sciences. The study aims to advance our knowledge of these problems by using a unique suite of instruments deployed to a field site at a high-elevation location in the Wasatch mountain range of Utah, that includes the capacity to automatically track individual snowflake motions in a laser light sheet, quantify the magnitude of air turbulence in their direct environment, and subsequently measure their mass, size, shape, and density. The projected outcomes of this three-year study include revised formulations for the relationship of snowflake fall speed, mass, and density to air temperature, and of the extent to which precipitation rates are enhanced or retarded by turbulence in storms. Anticipated improvements to weather instrumentation will assist commercialization through a University of Utah spin-off company for wider availability to the weather measurement, infrastructure resilience, and transportation safety sectors. Public outreach includes data classification through citizen science and data dissemination to snow-sports enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Snowflakes are denser in warmer air, and they display a highly non-linear response to turbulence whose impact on their average settling speed remains to be determined. This study aims to develop a more sophisticated understanding of two of the principle atmospheric processes determining how fast precipitation particles fall, temperature and turbulence. The University of Utah is uniquely poised to address this problem with its development of two new instruments with prior National Science Foundation?s support that permit the first direct, automated, measurements of individual hydrometeor mass and density. These devices will be deployed to a snowy high elevation field site alongside temperature, wind, and turbulence sensors, as well as a laser light sheet and fog machine. Particle Imaging Velocimetry will be used to track the motions of snowflakes and surrounding turbulent air. The expected project outcome will be revised parameterizations describing the relationship between atmospheric temperature and hydrometeor size, mass and density, as well as quantified metrics for how atmospheric turbulence affects individual hydrometeor mass flux and collective precipitation rate. In terms of its broader impacts, the study will exploit a combination of machine-learning and citizen science to facilitate hydrometeor classification. Additionally, anticipated improvements to instruments will be made available to the wider scientific and societal resilience communities through commercialization by an established University of Utah spin-off company.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This problem puts Alabama researchers at a competitive disadvantage for sponsored research that would otherwise benefit research, healthcare, and economic growth for the people of Alabama. The diversity of institutions and priorities have made the creation and implementation of a unified cyberinfrastructure plan difficult. Alabama, however, is at a unique moment in time where federal, state, and academic research priorities are aligned to invest in statewide cyberinfrastructure for research and economic development. Alabama EPSCoR (ALEPSCoR) recently completed a Science and Technology report identifying areas of strategic research importance. This project aims to take advantage of three existing efforts: the NSF CI CoE: Demo Pilot: Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium, the ALEPSCoR plan, and Governor Kay Ivey?s Alabama Executive Order 720 to stimulate an innovation economy. These three efforts not only have the potential to provide focus on broadening the playing field, but also bringing critical social and political energy to the table to transform research and education in Alabama for smaller institutions. The project aims to bring together a diverse group of institutions, including 15 HBCUs, to develop a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure plan. This has the potential to broaden participation and access to essential scientific computing resources. The team will host outreach events at each of the eight doctoral degree granting universities in the state in addition to one with industry leaders in the state. The events will be held at Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama at Huntsville, University of South Alabama, and Tuskegee University. The project goal to foster improved and better coordinated advanced research computing and networking capabilities across the state's institutions of higher education can contribute to increased STEM participation, education, and workforce training. <br/><br/>The Alabama Advanced Research Computing Consortium (AARCC) is composed of a steering committee and working groups from the eight doctoral universities, two of which are designated HBCUs, and industry leaders in the state, tasked with three deliverables: 1) a statewide cyberinfrastructure plan, 2) a statewide research network plan, and 3) a statewide research computing consortium plan. Stakeholder engagement events are being used to inform researchers and campus leaders about the research cyberinfrastructure available, and also for AARCC to learn about research priorities and cyberinfrastructure barriers at those institutions. AARCC will also coordinate with the Alabama Higher Education CIO Council to address needs for high-capacity networking within the state. Ultimately, AARCC seeks research competitiveness in ALEPSCoR investment priorities to spur growth of the modern 21st century Alabama economy. The activities proposed have the potential to significantly impact the role of computational education across the state of Alabama. Providing a collaborative state-wide cyberinfrastructure plan would provide significant value, especially to the bulk of the institutions in the state that serve underrepresented and rural populations.

This project supports fundamental research focused on creating better delivery agents that can better protect and carry the important nucleic acids like mRNA so it can do its job. We explore the use of exosomes as potential delivery vehicles.  Exosomes are essentially little compartments that are derived from our own cells. Because of this, they have key components that allow them to enter other cells and deliver cargo.  While exosomes have this unique advantage, loading them with the target therapeutic is challenging. To address this, the research team will develop small, charged proteins that can gently hold onto the negatively charged nucleic acids, which then helps improve the loading of exosomes.  This project will not only train the next generation graduate student and researcher in these new approaches, but also help inspire high school students as they will be able to carry out meaningful research experience both virtually and in person. Both the PI and co-PI have a strong record of training women and underrepresented minorities and plan to continue to recruit and train them as part of this work with the goal of developing and diversifying the future scientific workforce.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>Nucleic acids possess critical instructions for controlling biological processes with tangible implications in fundamental cell and organismal studies, biotechnology and medicine especially in light of delivery of vaccines for Covid-19. There is a need to develop a modular platform for the widespread delivery of nucleic acids, and exosomes have recently been identified as promising delivery agents. The mechanisms of assembly between membrane-derived lipids and recombinant proteins is poorly understood but provides an opportunity to optimize and explore the fundamental material properties of exosome-based delivery vehicles. The research team proposes to develop an engineered protein-exosome system or lipoproteoplex capable of: 1) encapsulating siRNA at a high efficiency into the exosome; 2) increasing siRNA release once inside the cell through increased endosomal escape; 3) performing efficient siRNA delivery with a favorable safety profile. For education and outreach, the team aims to focus on verified virtual platforms to provide students safe, meaningful research experiences.  Courses will focus on hybrid in-person and virtual lessons with an emphasis on group-based projects to facilitate active learning. For outreach, Dr. Montclare will participate in the Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE) program and engage local NYC 10th and 11th grade students in computational design of supercharged proteins. Dr. Rabbani will implement as part of the Wyss Sumer Research Fellowship, a biochemistry training that involves exosome preparation, characterization and use for transfection as well as recording protocol video and journal club discussion online. This will democratize research experience for students during the pandemic and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports studies of gravitational wave observations to gain a deeper understanding of gravity and black holes. Large financial resources have been invested in advanced detector design on the experimental side, and in a community effort to build compact binary detection templates on the theoretical/data analysis side. The first gravitational-wave detections by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration were a major milestone, but for gravitational-wave science to make even more groundbreaking contributions we must be able to go beyond detections, extracting fundamental physics from the strong-gravity dynamics of the sources. With the expected increase in volume coverage of LIGO/Virgo in the next observing runs, the operation of KAGRA in Japan, the completion of the Cosmic Explorer Horizon Study, and the inclusion of the Einstein Telescope in the 2021 ESFRI Roadmap, this work is timely, geared at enhancing the science scope of ground-based interferometers. The project will train students in a highly interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in general relativity, astrophysics, data analysis and high-energy physics. The students will benefit from interactions with a large international network of world-leading experts in gravitational physics.<br/><br/>The projects supported by this award are strongly intertwined, but for convenience they can be grouped in two main research areas: (1) ""black hole spectroscopy"", i.e. the research program trying to identify merger remnants as the black holes predicted by general relativity from their oscillation frequencies; and (2) ameliorating systematic effects in gravitational-wave astronomy. The first set of projects investigates the detectability of multiple ringdown modes, the measurability of their frequencies, the construction of better models for the ringdown mode amplitudes, and instabilities in quasinormal mode spectra. The second set studies how systematics could affect single-event parameter estimation within general relativity, lead to false ?detections? of effects beyond general relativity, and limit our ability to test general relativity and observe gravitational lensing. The PI's group will study the effect of systematics on parameter estimation, tests of general relativity and detection of lensing effects, at both the single-event and population levels. The knowledge gained will be used to devise self-correcting strategies to ameliorate the effect of systematics as we enter the Big Data regime of third-generation interferometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ground anchors are a structural component of many retaining walls and building foundations that resist forces attempting to pull the structure from the ground by transferring those forces to the surrounding soil. Such forces are called pullout loads. The conventional ground anchor may be fabricated and installed easily using simple tooling and components, but they are not highly efficient at resisting pullout loads. An economically competitive alternative to conventional ground anchors must be nearly as simple to install and more efficient in its use of materials. The proposed technology uses a bio-inspired root design to meet these criteria. The geometric design of root systems resists pullout loads more efficiently than the cylindrical external interfaces of conventional ground anchors. The proposed technology seeks to develop higher pullout load capacities than conventional anchors within a shorter bonded length. Shorter anchors use less cement and steel, require less drilling, consume less diesel fuel, and require fewer working hours to install.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a root-inspired ground anchor system. Prototypes have been studied in the lab as well as in preliminary field trials and they have demonstrated the feasibility of installing, expanding, and loading the bio-inspired system. The ongoing research is focused on scaling-up the technology to full field-scale using both numerical simulations and field tests on instrumented anchors. The proposed anchor consists of three primary components: a stressing element identical to the steel cables or bars used in conventional ground anchors; an expansive root mechanism, which is initially cylindrical but expands during installation to mimic the geometry of plant roots; and cement grout, which gives the systems stiffness and protects its components from corrosion. Certain plant species have root systems that anchor the organism in the soil much more efficiently than any ground anchors currently used in civil infrastructure; Their capacity to resist pullout loads is very high relative to the mass of the root system.  The expansive root mechanism of the proposed technology seeks to use the geometric principles of these root systems to resist pullout loads more efficiently than the cylindrical external interfaces of a conventional ground anchor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AD cannot be slowed or cured should the disease proceed to cognitive decline. Early detection would favor timely intervention to avoid brain cell loss and improve life quality of patients. The main goal of this project is to establish a viable and cost-effective strategy for early detection of AD through a set of relatively simple eye imaging procedures. New optical technologies will be developed to measure changes in eye and brain blood flow associated with AD. Machine learning tools will be deployed to predict the trajectory of the disease. In addition, this project will provide a training opportunity for engineering students to learn about AD and use their engineering skills to contribute to the collective effort of combating this devastating condition.<br/><br/>Neural degeneration and loss of connectivity in AD leads to morphological and metabolic changes in the brain that can be visualized in magnetic resonance or positron emission tomography images. However, these brain imaging methods, as diagnostic tools, are neither cost effective nor readily available to large populations. Since the eye is accessible for noninvasive imaging, several procedures have been proposed for detection of AD via ophthalmological examinations and retinal imaging. Unfortunately, none of these tests have proven to be effective indicators of AD at early stages of the disease. This project seeks to explore a promising alternative by studying changes in retinal hemodynamics for early AD detection. There is experimental evidence suggesting that AD-associated changes in specific features of retinal hemodynamics appear in the pre-symptomatic phase of AD making these features superior indicators for early diagnosis. In this project, advanced technologies including multi-photon microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and optogenetic neural stimulation will be developed and employed with biochemical and immunohistochemistry lab techniques, to study the correlation between the state and progression of AD in the brain and retina. Specifically, the relationship between changes in the resting-state cerebral and retinal blood flow and disruption of functional hyperemia under AD will be explored. In this project, the research team will test the analytical validity and potential clinical viability of these features for noninvasive early detection of AD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to causing emotional distress, loneliness has been linked to a multitude of negative mental and physical health outcomes, including an increased risk of death. One explanation for these harmful effects is that loneliness may intensify harmful and distressing fear responses. Individuals who experience loneliness overreact to potential threats, and they may also experience excessive fear when learning about new threats. The proposed project examines whether being lonely increases the strength of fear learning, the process by which new fears are formed, which would amplify the development of persistent fears in humans. Importantly, this research also tests methods to alleviate these effects by preventing or reducing the development of harmful fears among lonely individuals. By examining the relationship between loneliness and fear learning, this work advances an understanding of a route through which loneliness leads to negative outcomes and how to mitigate these effects. <br/><br/>This project provides new insights on how humans experience loneliness. Findings in the animal literature demonstrate that social isolation causes increased anxious behavior, augmented fear learning, delayed reductions in fear (extinction), and persistent fear responses. Additionally, preliminary work in humans reveals that the process by which fears are reduced is impaired in lonely individuals, but that this impairment is less pronounced when there are reminders of social support figures. This project involves a series of studies that examine whether: 1) loneliness augments fear learning in humans, leading to more persistent fears, 2) images of social support figures reduce fear learning and retention processes, and 3) the mitigating effects of social support reminders similarly occur when experiencing physical warmth. Physically warm objects share overlapping fear-reducing properties with social support reminders and are more accessible for lonely individuals who do not have supportive social bonds. The findings of this work provide important information on loneliness. Support for the expected fear processes can suggest simple, non-invasive, and low-cost interventions to reduce the harmful effects of being lonely.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike any other elements, helium can remain liquid down to absolute zero temperature (0 K, -273 °C, -460 °F). In this regime (roughly 2 K and below), helium demonstrates some unique properties that can only be described by quantum physics. Two kinds of helium atoms exist in nature, so called isotopes with different mass: He-3 and He-4. While on the outside they seem similar, He-3 and He-4 behave very differently in the low temperature regime. Below 2K, He-4 loses all viscosity and can spontaneously create small, rotating tornados inside the liquid called quantum vortices. In this state, helium-4 is known as a superfluid.  He-3, however, remains in the normal fluid state in the low temperature regime due to a quantum mechanical difference between He-3 and He-4. This project investigates physical superfluid properties in nano-sized droplets of liquid helium by taking snapshots of them with x-rays using a linear particle accelerator. Images of superfluid He-4 droplets containing quantum vortices are compared to those of normal fluid He-3 droplets. Additionally, images of droplets containing a mixture of both types of helium are obtained to see how the isotopes interact. This project provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to take part in cutting-edge science and acquire technical skills which strengthen the US STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Helium droplets have long been considered ideal systems to explore vorticity in self-contained, isolated superfluids. This group has recently shown the feasibility of such studies using single, sub-micrometer sized helium droplets interrogated via x-ray scattering using a free electron laser. Droplets undergo rotation after exiting the nozzle, manifesting an array of quantum vortices and shape deformations depending on the magnitude of the droplet?s angular momentum. This project expands the x-ray study of quantum droplets to new directions such as the rotation of capsule-shaped droplets, which involves a concerted action of quantum vortices and capillary waves. The project also probes quantum phase separation in rotating nanodroplets made of mixtures of the bosonic He-4 and the fermionic He-3. Additionally, the droplets are used as an experimental vessel to tackle the so-called Thompson problem, finding the minimum energy configuration of N unit charges on a sphere, which remains unsolved experimentally. Finally, the shapes of rotating superfluid He-4 and non-superfluid He-3 droplets are obtained and compared. The proposed experiments will provide benchmark information on the structure, stability, and rotational dynamics of free rotating super- and non-superfluid droplets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, what distinguishes these events is rarely the technical mechanisms by which unauthorized access was first obtained, but rather the methodical actions taken after gaining such access. Thus, while efforts to protect against initial intrusions remain important, it is clearly every bit as important to develop sound approaches for detecting and subduing the actions of attackers already operating inside an organization.  This project tackles precisely this problem: how to detect, identify and remediate malicious actors via their operational actions inside an organization. To address this goal, the project?s novelty is in developing a network analysis system to model the causality of computer and network events ? ways in which an action that occurred on one machine can be explained as an attacker pivoting from another machine in pursuit of increased access in an organization. The project?s broader significance and importance are in providing a well-founded rigorous basis for evaluating best practices for detecting and mitigating enterprise-scale data breaches.<br/><br/>Using an inferred causal graph of such activities, the investigators develop and evaluate detectors for evidence of internal reconnaissance, lateral movement and external communication. Using both empirical data sources and a simulator for testing a range of enterprise network models, the investigators explore the extent to which this causal framework can distinguish known attacks from the broad range of benign activities that take place.   Finally, the project also evaluates the value of such frameworks for both triage and post-incident response, removing the manual work involved in identifying which machines and accounts may have been compromised.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This federally funded project aims to take traditional magnetism into nanometric dimensions to realize atomic-scale magnetic patterns resembling a hedgehog?s spikes, called skyrmions. Skyrmion formation offers new functionalities in logic and information storage that are not possible in traditional magnetic materials. Through this funding, the team aims to realize skyrmions in atomically thin materials, understand their magnetic behavior, and manipulate their properties. While doing so, the project aims to discover novel classes of magnetic materials and technologies that will increase the U.S military and economic competitiveness at a global scale and open ways to realize high-performance and next-generation applications towards quantum memory, logic, and communication devices. The immediate societal impacts of the project will manifest through high-school, undergraduate and graduate student training in an active research environment as well as K-12 outreach efforts to introduce students to STEM fields and materials science. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected nanometric size spin textures with exciting quantum properties towards information and neuro-inspired technologies. To date, the experimentally known skyrmionic platforms are restricted to bulk crystals and metallic multilayer films. The ultimate goal of this project is to experimentally stabilize skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) and van der Waals layered materials and investigate emergent properties arising from reduced dimensions. The project will use transition metal dihalide monolayers and their moiré superlattices as a platform and it will combine theoretical and experimental studies to explore three different mechanisms for skyrmion realization: 1) inversion symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic monolayers, 2) tunable electric fields in ferromagnetic monolayers, 3) twistronics in homobilayers. The project will utilize magneto-optical Kerr, Lorentz microscopy, and diamond-NV atomic force microscope techniques to experimentally understand their magnetic properties. Density functional and Monte-Carlo studies will offer theoretical insights for complete understanding of these 2D skyrmionic platforms. The results from this project will fill a large fundamental knowledge gap in the field by establishing what hallmark characteristics are important for skyrmion formation in the monolayer and few-layer limit.

For example, the next-generation gas turbines need to be able to work at 1300 degrees Celsius, to boost efficiency and save energy. The next-generation hypersonic passenger aircraft and re-entry vehicles need to withstand 1000-3000 degrees Celsius at the leading edges without material loss. The next-generation nuclear fission plant and other thermal power plants are desired to work at higher temperatures for higher energy-conversion efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The development of future fusion plants requires even higher temperatures. All these technologies require effective management of heat flow at ultra-high temperatures. However, the fundamental thermal transport processes in materials at ultra-high temperatures remain unclear. It is therefore necessary to develop theories to gain a deep understanding and conduct simulations to accurately predict thermal transport at ultra-high temperatures in order to realize technology revolutions. This project addresses a critical issue in thermal transport: state-of-the-art theories significantly underpredict the thermal conductivity of most crystals at room temperature and further worsen as the temperature increases.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to unveil the fundamental thermal transport mechanisms and accurately predict the thermal conductivity of nonmetallic materials from low to ultra-high temperatures. The proposal envisions three major foci: (i) incorporate the fully temperature-dependent interatomic interaction into the predictions and validate the proof-of-concept finding that such effort can generally solve the universal thermal conductivity under-prediction problem at high temperatures; (ii) develop formalisms for five-heat carrier interaction processes, which can be important at high temperatures; (iii) develop a method that can fully predict the photon contribution to thermal transport in solids through accurate prediction of the dielectric function. The project will enable five-heat carrier interaction predictions, which will be potentially transformative because they are intrinsic thermal transport mechanisms in all solids and have been elusive to scientists for decades. It will answer two pressing questions: In general solids, at what temperatures is the five-heat carrier interaction important? At low temperatures, in which systems is the five-heat carrier interaction important?

The science of gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window on the universe. Through it, we can observe the light-speed collisions of black holes, some of the most enigmatic objects in the universe. These objects are the remnants of very massive stars (30-100 times heavier than the Sun) that collapsed under their own gravity millions of light-years across the Universe. Similar to how archeology uses the remnants of ancient civilizations to understand how they lived their lives, this project, Black Hole Archaeology, will use these black hole remnants to understand the processes governing the lives of massive stars. Black Hole Archaeology will advance our understanding of the structure and evolution of stars, test Einstein?s theory of General Relativity, and shed new light on the nature of dark matter. The sensational themes of the project ? exploding stars, general relativity, and ripples in spacetime ? will become the foundation of a new and exciting outreach project that will see volunteer researchers engage students at the K-12 level in schools across the island of O?ahu in an effort to remove barriers responsible for the under-representation of Native Hawaiians in STEM disciplines, and to mitigate inequities in the exposure of K-12 students to STEM engagement across the island.<br/> <br/>This project will develop novel competitive probes of stellar structure theory, dark matter, dark energy, and gravity using black hole population statistics. The mass function of astrophysical black holes offers unique insights into the processes governing their progenitors: massive stars. The shape of the mass function as well as the location of features such as the black hole mass gap are sensitive to stellar process such as nuclear reactions, as well as potential new physics such as novel energy losses due to dark matter and dark energy, and modifications of general relativity. The goals of this project are: 1. develop numerical codes capable of theoretically predicting the astrophysical black hole mass spectrum (including the location of the mass gap) in competing dark matter, dark energy, and gravity theories, and when the rates of nuclear reactions effecting massive stars are varied; 2. develop a novel theoretical astrophysical black hole mass function whose free parameters correspond directly with important astrophysical quantities such as the location of the mass gap; and 3. train the next generation of scientists by coaching graduate and undergraduate students in this highly interdisciplinary frontier science. This project will expand the science applications of gravitational wave astronomy by enabling information about fundamental physics and the processes governing massive stars to be extracted from gravitational wave catalogs. This will enable a deeper understanding of stellar structure, nuclear physics, particle physics, cosmology, and gravitation. The project will probe physics in regimes that are inaccessible to stellar surveys, particle physics, cosmological missions, and direct detection experiments, and will thus establish a new complementary frontier.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 1 in 7 major surgical procedures in the US is associated with a medical complication, totaling more than 4 million complications and $80 billion in costs per year. Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.  A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare. Big data in healthcare is inconsistently structured and not optimized to directly improve patient outcomes. The large datasets for most procedures provide only high-level conclusions regarding risk; they do not pinpoint the specific steps in provider workflow with high risk or the role of external factors, such as comorbidities or facility age. This project will determine the feasibility of using machine learning supervised by experienced clinicians to assess risk using principles from Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. The project will develop a proof-of-concept machine-learning system that uses a proprietary risk taxonomy and modifiers to combine national, state, facility, and actuarial datasets to generate risk priority numbers for each step for a service line.

Spillover of zoonotic pathogens has proven difficult to control and virtually impossible to eliminate. Although animal vaccination programs using standard methods have reduced the burden of spillover in some cases (e.g., rabies, brucellosis), other regions endure continued spillover because logistical and financial challenges make delivering large quantities of vaccine to wild and domestic animal populations impractical. A novel solution to this problem is the transformation of benign, naturally-occurring viruses into into vaccines capable of self dissemination, i.e., transmissible vaccines. A growing body of theory shows that vaccine transmission makes it possible to eliminate the risk of spillover from hard to reach and difficult to vaccinate animal populations at a fraction of the cost that would be required via traditional one vaccine-one host vaccination campaigns. Such vaccines are increasingly feasible to generate in the laboratory, but many technical challenges and unresolved questions underpin their safe and effective implementation in natural systems. This workshop will coordinate the development of transmissible vaccines by bringing together immunologists, vaccine engineers, virologists, disease ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mathematical modelers. An important goal of the workshop will be to increase the diversity of the community working on this emerging technology, with a specific focus on increasing the representation of early career scientists, women, and scientists from lower middle-income countries where the technology may have the most immediate positive impacts on human health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to increase awareness of and interest in STEM careers as a way to broaden participation in STEM careers. Key program components will include weekly hands-on activities that engage the students with technology through the engineering design process led by undergraduate STEM mentors who also are from groups underrepresented in STEM careers; the Scientist of the Week, which exposes students either to a STEM pioneer from underrepresented groups or a current STEM professional from an industry partner; the math problem of the day, which is aligned to state standards for fourth and fifth grades; and an end-of-year interactive STEM fair, during which students demonstrate their knowledge to larger audiences from their schools and communities.<br/><br/>The research questions that will guide this mixed-methods project will include: 1) What strategies help conceptualize STEM knowledge in a manner that affirms students' racial identity and cultural ways of knowing? 2) How do students' STEM identity and awareness of and interest in STEM change over time? 3) How do families engage in their children?s STEM learning in out-of-school STEM communities, and 4) how does family participation shape students' interest in STEM and their STEM identity? Data from interviews, observations, and questionnaires on Engineering Identity and Career Aspirations will be gathered and analyzed to study possible changes over time. The project's research will contribute to the knowledge-base on family engagement in STEM learning and the STEM identities of racially and ethnically diverse students. Specifically, the team will build upon their prior research on students' STEM identity and program implementation by studying students' STEM identity longitudinally, the racial dimensions of STEM identity, and variability in program implementation across school sites. This project will also have an explicit focus on broadening participation in STEM studies and careers among Students of Color. Within two years, the project will expand to four elementary schools in the Houston region. During the timeline of this award, the project will directly impact 140 fourth and fifth grade Students of Color and an additional 50 students and families per site, per year through the annual interactive STEM fair. This project will also directly engage 50 racially and ethnically diverse STEM mentors who lead project activities.

However, it is not known how they could be combined to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Fascinating phenomena such as the very first stages of the Big Bang or the cores of black holes therefore remain out of the reach of our current understanding. This research investigates a wide range of systems in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics are relevant, thereby promoting the progress of science. The main focus is on methods that allow one to derive physical implications by suitable approximations, and to use the results to guide the development of quantum gravity. Applications to the Big Bang and black holes often lead to conclusions that capture the interest of the general public. Related methods can also be used in systems not involving general relativity, where they may help to solve technical questions or to communicate results in a new way, supporting for instance the teaching of quantum mechanics. This research supports diversity by including members of under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to introduce and evaluate new methods for a systematic analysis of physical implications of one set of candidate theories of quantum gravity, based on canonical quantization. Throughout physics, a powerful tool to derive potentially observable phenomena is given by effective theories which provide quantum corrections to the classical equations. Such systems can more easily be evaluated, analytically or numerically, than equations for quantum states and thus are more direct sources for the discovery of new phenomena. While standard techniques to derive effective equations do not apply to canonical quantum gravity, a general scheme applicable to canonical quantum theories exists (introduced by the PI) and is used in this project to address the main problems of quantum gravity. It provides the basis for a long-term program evaluating physical phenomena in the broad context of quantum gravity. Such a systematic derivation will make it possible to put effects found previously in simplified models on a firm footing, uncover new phenomena and provide reliable predictions.  Results will be used to compare the theory with other candidates of quantum gravity, with the potential of a fruitful transfer of ideas and techniques between the approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But as semiconductor technology now faces fundamental physical limits, even while large-scale systems are reaching warehouse scales, new approaches are becoming essential to achieving efficient use of computing resources. In particular, given this divergence of scales, HPC systems have necessarily become more distributed and  asynchronous (in the sense that system clocks are asynchronous), resulting in increasingly variable and unpredictable execution. While these effects are recognized as critical hindrances to HPC performance, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. What is known, however, is that much HPC infrastructure is tasked with dealing with inefficiency derived from asynchrony, variability, and unpredictability, leading to a deep and complex hardware/software support stack. The project team's hypothesis is that while each stack element provides a local solution, it may also exacerbate the global problem: that complexity has resulted in more variability, not less, and made determining its causes more difficult. This project explores the possibility of reversing the trend of ever-increasing complexity by removing and simplifying support layers. This strategy?s achievable gains remain limited, however, while the underlying cause, execution asynchrony, remains unaddressed. The approach begins by leveraging recently developed technology that enables clocks to remain extremely accurate even when distributed on a planetary scale. Such accurate, distributed clocks serve to underpin a virtuous cycle where synchrony establishes baseline predictability, which, in turn, reduces variability, and at each stage of the cycle enables reduction in the complexity of the support stack. A benefit of this approach is that the individual steps are largely simple and can be applied directly to existing software systems. <br/><br/>This one-year project aims to obtain early findings and practical demonstrations for the importance of synchrony and predictability to increase HPC compute efficiency and thereby improve large-scale program execution. Five tasks are conducted. The first is to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate clock distribution by augmenting existing HPC network infrastructure. The second is to demonstrate the application of synchrony in the establishing a virtuous cycle enabling  simplifications to the software/system support stack. The third is to devise mechanisms to model, measure, and validate systems using the proposed methods. The fourth is to investigate the relative benefits of applying the synchrony-based virtuous cycle with respect to various application classes. The fifth is to demonstrate the overall efficacy of the proposed approach through a case study involving a production application. Overall, the project works to  determine whether added synchronization through accurate clocks enables significant improvements to HPC computations in terms of how efficiently they use computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 90% of those cases, dogs are treated based on empirical data, which means veterinarians take an educated guess, and fewer than 10% are tested. Dogs are more likely to develop clinical signs of kennel cough the longer they are in a group-housing environment.  The 5 million cases in the United States are underestimated and do not typically include cases from kennels, shelters, and/or boarding facilities. With the current procedures, veterinarians may send samples to central laboratories that take many days to provide results.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Climate change is disrupting the seasonal behavior and reproductive activities of many species, driving some organisms to the brink of extinction. Species may respond to a changing climate by shifting their distribution to escape warming temperatures or remaining in place and adapting to altered environmental conditions. This study takes advantage of modern and historical specimens of the willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), a threatened migratory bird, to study how populations have adapted at a genetic level to warming conditions since the early 1900s and whether the extent of past adaptation to climate change could explain recent population declines. This project will improve the ability of researchers to accurately predict species responses to environmental change and incorporate this information into management decisions to mitigate widespread population declines. To increase the impact of this research, the fellow will conduct local outreach with Title I schools in Colorado, develop bilingual, open-source evolution teaching materials, and assist with international genomics workshops in Latin America.<br/><br/>The study will combine relative abundance information and genomic sequencing data from contemporary and historical willow flycatchers to investigate the relationships among genetic variation in fitness-related traits (i.e., a species? adaptive potential), climate adaptation, and population trajectories over the last century. The fellow will first use emerging methods in environmental, phenotypic, and genomic data analysis to identify regions of the genome that are associated with climate adaptation and climate-linked traits (body and bill size). Next, the fellow will track whether allele frequencies at climate- and phenotype-associated genomic regions have tracked shifts in climate over the past century. Finally, the fellow will evaluate whether the extent of past climate tracking through shifts in allele frequencies predicts patterns of relative abundance over time.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Environmental microorganisms, like bacteria, can evolve the molecular machinery to become disease pathogens in animal or human hosts. How does this occur? One hypothesis is that the need to survive predation by microeukaryotes, such as amoeba, selects for the evolution of genes that fight eukaryotic immunity. However, one ancient eukaryotic immune response is to deny pathogens access to iron. Successful pathogens have evolved tools to fight against the host to acquire iron. The outcome of this molecular tug of war is critical as iron is a vital micronutrient, required by most organisms for growth and survival. This project focuses on how adaptation to predatory amoeba, specifically the host-pathogen battle for iron has caused the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila to evolve at the molecular level. The Fellow will recruit and mentor students in research in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh.  <br/><br/>Host-pathogen conflicts can lead to molecular arms races, where domains of the proteins at the host-pathogen interface are subjected to ongoing cycles of rapid host and pathogen evolution. This project will test the hypothesis that the battle for iron has led iron sequestration genes to rapidly evolve as part of a molecular arms race between Legionella and its natural amoeba hosts. This project takes advantage of the power and utility of the Legionella/Dictyostelium infection model. Specifically, the Fellow will interrogate the evolution of MavN, a protein secreted by Legionella that functions to transport iron from the host cytosol into the Legionella-containing vacuole. The MavN protein shows signatures of rapid evolution and this sequence diversity has phenotypic consequences. These features suggest that MavN might be evolving due to a molecular arms race. This work bridges the current divide between evolutionary microbiology, bioinformatics, and bacteriology, and will enable the Fellow to enhance and develop skills that they will need to establish their own career as an independent researcher. This project will enable the Fellow to gain training in mentoring, scientific rigor, and how to foster inclusive environments in STEM.

Despite sustained attention from stakeholders, the ultimate fate of consumer plastics in the ocean remains an open question. Exposure to sunlight is a key degradation process (i.e., photo-degradation) for most consumer plastics but the controls that affect the rates and extents of plastic photo-degradation in the ocean are not well understood. This study aims to determine the factors that control photochemical degradation of consumer plastics and thus their fate in the ocean. The basic knowledge gained from this research will inform fate and transport models that estimate the amount, location, and persistence of plastics in the ocean, as well as their potential impacts on ecosystem processes. This project supports engagement with the Lincoln Laboratory Beaver Works Summer Institute and the Build a CubeSat Challenge, opportunities for high school students across the country to learn about marine plastic pollution.  Moreover, numerous undergraduate, and graduate students will be trained and participate on this research project.<br/><br/>It is widely understood that sunlight chemically transforms plastics in the ocean into a suite of polymer-, dissolved-, and gas-phase products. However, the governing controls of these photochemical processes are poorly constrained. This research will deconvolute the relative importance of varying controls on the photochemical reactivity of consumer plastics at sea, including particle size, plastic formulation (i.e., base polymer + inorganic additives such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide), and sunlight wavelength. Specific measures to be tested include oxidation (molecular oxygen consumption), chain scission (decrease in molecular weight), and the production of dissolved organics.

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several algebraic structures of interest, such as groups or vector spaces, consist of endowing a set with one or more operations subject to axioms. Often, interesting phenomena in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and logic seem at first glance to be formalizable by one of such algebraic structures, although with a closer look one realizes that the equalities demanded by the axioms do not quite hold. Instead, the failure of the validity of the axioms is captured by the presence of a ""higher isomorphism,"" whose nature is clear in the specific contexts. To accommodate those situations, one needs to acknowledge the presence of higher structures and replace the role played by the usual equality relation with higher isomorphisms, organizing the information into a higher category of some kind. Many objects of interest have by now been identified to have a specific type of higher structure called an (infinity, n)-category. The research project will investigate multiple questions related to this. Broader impacts of this collaborative research will be through making the literature more accessible to the users of higher category theory. The PI plans to organize an online working group of students and early career researchers to explore the features of the various models. Resulting expository materials will be made available online.<br/> <br/>An (infinity, n)-category is a type of categorical structure with objects and morphisms in each dimension which are furthermore invertible above dimension n. While there is a general agreement about this schematic idea, numerous alternative mathematical implementations of the definition of an (infinity, n)-category have been proposed, each approach leading to its own advantages and disadvantages. At present, some models are expected but not known to be equivalent. Even when models have been shown to be abstractly equivalent, it is often not easy to export constructions and results from a model to another. This research project sets goals to advance knowledge both in terms of developing aspects of specific models and understanding how to relate different models. The projects aim to provide consistency results that are currently lacking from the existing (infinity, 2)-categorical literature, producing an accessible and well-documented account of the pool of models of (infinity, 2)-categories as well as how they relate to the strict 2-categorical literature. These include developing a theory of weighted limits in (infinity, 2)-categories, proving a comparison of (infinity, 2)-categorical nerves, and studying the compatibility of the Gray tensor product with such nerves. Further, building on current work of the PI with collaborators, one of the main long-term aims of the joint research is to establish the equivalence of n-complicial sets with all other main models of (infinity, n)-categories for n>2. A positive answer to this longstanding question is crucial to unifying various results in the context of the (infinity, n)-literature. Finally, the PI also plans to formalize explicitly the inductive and coinductive homotopy theories of (infinity, infinity)-categories, understanding how they relate with the existing literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Brodbelt and her group develop new high performance methods that combine MS and both gas-phase separations and reactions to examine proteins and pinpoint the modifications in molecular detail.  In particular, the Brodbelt group uses high energy lasers to shatter proteins to create diagnostic fragmentation patterns that reveal structures and modifications.  The comprehensive plan engages students at multiple levels in collaborative, interdisciplinary research and provides professional training for the transition to scientific careers.<br/>  <br/>Analysis of intact proteins remains one of the frontiers of proteomics, and the ability to characterize intact proteins offers one of the best means to map combinatorial modifications that play critical roles in protein structure and function.

This project emphasizes the development and applications of UVPD for analysis of intact proteins. The main aims integrate dynamic ion manipulation strategies utilizing proton transfer reactions, gas-phase fractionation, and charge detection measurement methods to amplify the information content of MS/MS spectra of intact proteins.  UVPD is used to characterize isomers separated by ion mobility via a modular drift cell, and collision cross-sections of proteins are measured.

However, existing modeling methods cannot realistically test how increasing ocean temperatures will affect the needs of marine micro-organisms for the limiting nutrients that usually control their growth, including nitrogen, phosphorus and iron.  Because these limiting nutrients govern how much photosynthesis occurs in the ocean, they strongly influence the fate of carbon dioxide produced by human fossil-fuel burning. For this reason, determining how nutrient use by plankton will respond to greenhouse warming of the surface ocean is a priority for scientists and policy makers.  This project supports a collaboration between two marine microbiologists in the United States and an Earth system modeler from the United Kingdom that is aiming to better understand how oceanic limiting nutrient cycles and the biological communities they support will react to global warming.  The U.S. investigators are using laboratory culture experiments, field work in the coastal ocean, and existing collections of past open ocean chemistry and biology measurements to generate quantitative estimates of rising temperature effects on nutrient elemental use efficiencies (EUEs).  An EUE is defined as the rate at which a marine microbe can take up carbon dioxide via photosynthesis, per unit of limiting nutrient in the cell. Preliminary results show that EUEs are highly sensitive to changing temperature, which in turn has far-reaching consequences for how ocean ecosystems function. The U.K. investigator is using these experimentally-determined values to build a new Earth system model that is centered on how warmer conditions will affect EUEs for important groups of marine micro-organisms. This novel approach has the potential to yield much better estimates of the ways that ocean carbon uptake and nutrient cycling will be altered as the ocean continues to warm in the future.  Broader Impacts include breaking new scientific ground in oceanography and climate science through improved Earth system models, providing educational opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate researchers, K-12 students, and postdoctoral investigators, and strengthening collaborative ties between the marine science communities of the U.S. and the U.K.<br/><br/>Quantitative relationships between phytoplankton nutrient limitation, primary production and globally-rising sea surface temperatures are still not well understood, largely due to a lack of mechanistic experimental data. This is problematic for Earth system modelers who are trying to project future oceanic productivity levels that underpin predicted changes in ocean ecosystems, information that is urgently needed to inform environmental policy makers. This project addresses this knowledge gap in a closely coordinated, collaborative project between two U.S. marine microbiologists and a biogeochemical modeler from the U.K.  The international team of interdisciplinary researchers are applying the emergent concept of Elemental Use Efficiencies (EUEs) to integrate flexible thermal and resource limitation responses into a new generation of Earth system models. EUEs are defined as the amount of carbon fixed per unit time, normalized to the amount of a limiting resource in a phytoplankton cell, as represented by the cellular nutrient quota.  Preliminary work suggests that EUEs can be very sensitive to future ocean warning, with major downstream consequences for nutrient-limited marine plankton assemblages and thus also for ocean carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry. The investigators are using high-throughput thermal block methodology to measure EUEs for the limiting nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and iron in a diverse set of four different functional groups of laboratory phytoplankton isolates across their entire thermal ranges. EUEs obtained for these three key limiting nutrient resources as a function of temperature and degree of nutrient stress are being applied in an iterative manner to inform a novel EUE-centric version of the established NEMO-PISCES ocean model. Field EUE data from coastal and open ocean regimes are being collected for comparison to and ground-truthing of both the laboratory culture results, and the modeling output. This project will advance the discipline of ocean global change biology by providing unique new insights into how biogeochemically-critical marine microbial functional groups may respond to simultaneous shifts in temperature and limiting nutrient resource availability both today, and in the future changing ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established 50 years ago to ensure that all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn, and work. However, low-income communities of color continue to be disproportionately exposed to air and water pollution. Disparities in exposure to air and water pollution have led to scholarship on environmental justice principles, which asserts that communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations. Professional societies and national academies are actively involved in these discussions. For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers? (ASCE) statement on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion calls for building mutually beneficial partnerships with engineering and non-engineering organizations and advancing a research agenda centered on equitable and inclusive engineering education, research, and practice. An overarching challenge for environmental engineering is educational reform to ensure holistic solutions that build on authentic partnerships with community stakeholders, especially those whose agency has historically been limited in environmental decision making.

The project aims to include additional faculty at the two institutions who have expressed interest in participating in the project?s workshops that would impact additional engineering courses. Results from the proposed research will be disseminated through channels to reach diverse stakeholders at multiple universities through faculty workshops/seminars, community meetings, and an annual Institute on Black Life conference that focuses on community engaged partnership and scholarship. Project results will be shared with STEM educators at national conferences convened by societies such as the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, American Society of Engineering Education conference, and the American Educational Research Association. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rather than place the security burden entirely on developers of embedded systems, the objective of this project is to shift the enforcement of fundamental security properties to the compiler, using a combination of compile-time static analysis, runtime instrumentation, and hardware support. The project will also consider compiler enhancements to enable end-developer security customization and promote software longevity.<br/><br/>The project will provide a scientific foundation for compiler-assisted security on low-cost embedded systems. Such systems are already widely deployed in existing domains, such as cyber-physical systems, and are increasingly a part of emerging technologies, such as the internet-of-things (IoT). The project will produce open-source software and educational artifacts for both researchers and developers, including compiler enhancements, benchmark applications, and tutorials on the artifacts to be presented at tutorials and conferences.

Further, like a canary in a coal mine, host switching by symbionts may reveal emerging risk factors leading to infectious diseases in hosts. On the other hand, extinction of symbionts inform can inform us about the impacts of environmental change. Information on symbionts diversity is limited, however, since they are relatively understudied organisms. This project investigates lizards and their haemosporidian symbionts in sub-Saharan Africa. Haemosporida is a diverse group of vector-borne protozoan symbionts found in terrestrial vertebrates in almost all world ecosystems. Although some species have been studied because of their link to malaria in birds and humans, haemosporidian symbionts in African lizards are poorly known. This project provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Local assemblages of African lizards include sets of taxa differing in degree of ecological and phylogenetic distinctiveness. Unlike birds, lizards do not disperse broadly, and local assemblages are less diverse. These characteristics reduce bias in host species censuses, allowing us to test hypotheses about the factors driving host/symbiont biodiversity. Thus, this study aims to (1) advance our understanding of Haemosporida species delimitation by formalizing an approach that integrates morphological, molecular, and ecological data, (2) generate new knowledge on the processes driving haemosporidian species diversity by studying newly detected Haemosporida species in host clades across their distribution in distinct biomes, (3) enrich biodiversity sciences by developing standards for symbiont-host data integration, and (4) generate knowledge on the regional herpetofauna with new specimens and metadata.

Aging is accompanied by a significant reduction in mobility. Existing treatments and therapies rely on respiratory measurements of walking effort. These respiratory measurements can only quantify the average effort of walking. As a result of this limitation, existing treatments and therapies sometimes fail to target the phases of the walking motion that need the most assistance. This project will use data-driven approaches and models to overcome limitations in the ability to measure the effort of walking. Access to this new information will enable evaluating how therapies affect different stages of motion. The data-driven methods will be initially developed using a dataset generated by a computer walking models with physically induced changes to specific stages of motion. For example, forward-pulling forces will be applied to the waist of the model to induce changes that can be leveraged to detect the fluctuations in walking effort. This computer walking model provides access to a complete measure of the effort required for walking, which will be used to validate the data-driven methods. Next, the new data-driven methods will be validated using measurements from real human walking experiments. In these human experiments, pulling forces will be applied by a robotic tether connected to the waist of the participant to induce changes that will be used to detect the effort of the different motion stages. In the final studies, the methods will be used to determine how the effort required for walking differs in younger and older adults. The differences in the effort will be characterized in each stage of motion using human experiments with both younger and older adults. The outcomes of this project will help lead to the creation of enhanced treatments and assistive devices that improve all stages of motion. Throughout this project, the investigators will provide courses for older adults on the mechanics and health aspects of walking and data science and digital engineering through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to leverage new data-driven approaches to characterize differences in metabolic cost of phases of the gait cycle in old versus young adults. The project will combine novel, data-driven approaches based on system identification and robotic perturbations to characterize the time profile of signals that cannot be measured directly, such as metabolic cost. The first objective will produce the time profile of metabolic cost within simulated gait data. Novel data-driven approaches will be developed based on weighted regression, neural networks, and autoencoders to identify the metabolic cost time profile from biomechanical signals. Initially, these methods will be created in a predictive walking simulation from which the metabolic time profile is fully known, such that the new methods can be evaluated during their development. The second objective will evaluate different time profile estimation approaches in human experiments. The methods created in the first objective will be tested using human experiments with robotic perturbations. The capacity of using the data-driven methods to detect changes in swing and push-off will also be investigated using human experiments where elastic ankle tethers or added mass are used to introduce direct changes to the gait cycle. The third objective will characterize the differences in cost contributions of the phases of the gait cycle between older and younger adults. The first subtask will characterize the phase-specific differences in metabolic cost by applying the data-driven methods to compute the instantaneous costs using measured data from younger and older adults. The second subtask will determine the generalizability of the data-driven time-profile estimation approaches across different populations. This research will transform gait analysis by providing access to dynamic metabolic cost time profiles, which cannot be measured using existing techniques. Access to this new information will lead to improvements across multiple biomechanics applications, including (1) diagnosis of motion impairments, (2) prescription of targeted assistive devices, and (3) targeted rehabilitation exercises.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering Program (DARE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They offer characteristics that make them promising for high-density, fast, and low-power nonvolatile memory devices: Firstly, there is no inter-bit dipole interaction between neighboring bits, making it possible to place adjacent bits closer together than with ferromagnetic devices. Secondly, antiferromagnets can potentially have ultrafast write times in the picosecond range, due to their exchange-dominated dynamics. Thirdly, devices based on these materials would be immune to tampering by magnetic fields, making them more secure than ferromagnet-based devices. However, to date, the realization of these devices has been hindered by the difficulty of electrically interacting with antiferromagnetic materials, particularly in industry-relevant materials and at nanoscale dimensions. This project aims to develop three-terminal antiferromagnetic memory devices with full electrical read and write capability, based on silicon-compatible antiferromagnetic materials that can be integrated in existing semiconductor manufacturing processes. This project will have a significant economic impact by enabling magnetic memories to address broader markets than currently possible, including dynamic random-access memory and embedded static random-access memory. In addition to its economic impact, this project will achieve broader impact through the incorporation of significant outreach and education activities. This includes outreach to the broader public through performance arts (science-themed plays and film screenings) through the Engineering Transdisciplinary Outreach Project in the Arts at Northwestern University. Research results will also be integrated into a newly developed course that the PI is teaching at Northwestern University, which focuses on the fundamentals and applications of magnetism and spintronics.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is in the device design, modeling, fabrication, and electrical characterization of three-terminal nonvolatile memory devices. The devices will be primarily based on noncollinear conductive antiferromagnetic materials that can be sputter-deposited on silicon substrates (e.g., SnMn3, GaMn3, IrMn3 and related compounds). The magnetic state will be controlled electrically via current-induced spin-orbit torque from an adjacent heavy metal. The project aims to demonstrate scaling of this device operation down to industry-relevant bit diameters. The project will also integrate the electrical write mechanism with electrical readout via a tunneling magnetoresistance structure, translating the Néel vector modification into an electrical resistance change. The separation of read and write paths allows for higher cycling endurance and separate optimization of material parameters for the read and write steps. Thermal budgets, statistical variations induced by device variability, and other effects of the fabrication process on device characteristics will be investigated. The developed memory devices will be fully characterized to compare their performance to existing ferromagnet-based memory devices in terms of write time, write energy, write error rates (i.e., switching probability), read disturb rates, and cycling endurance. The device-level tradeoffs (e.g., between speed and endurance) will be characterized and compared to other existing and emerging memory technologies. Modeling will be performed both at the micromagnetic level to aid in device design, and at the physics-based compact model level, to allow for implementation into circuit design environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principal investigators at Georgia Southern University (GSU) and Mississippi State University will recruit and provide initial training and preparation for cohorts of six U.S. undergraduates each year for three years. The PIs have had previous and ongoing collaborations on advanced controls of power electronic converters and interacted with the Center of Reliable Power Electronics (CORPE) in AAU Energy (formerly known as the Department of Energy Technology). Some European countries are currently leading the research on the practical use of renewables in smart grids. AAU?s power program is one of the largest and youngest in Europe, consistently ranked No. 1 across the continent. AAU Energy and CORPE are ranked among the best for Research Impact Measures. It is an ideal partner for the proposed project?offering U.S. students a unique international research experience in all areas of power electronic systems. This research benefits society and the environment by 1) increasing the penetration of renewables, 2) increasing career interest in the field of power electronic systems for modern power grids, and 3) improving the quality and quantity of the U.S. power engineering workforce. Theories confirmed by project research may be tailored and broadly developed for other systems in the power and energy industry. GSU and MSU are ready, willing, and singularly able to recruit underrepresented minorities, including women, African Americans, Native Americans, and Latin American, to participate in STEM research and teaching. Moreover, the women leading the power/energy system research at CORPE are excellent role models in an area where women remain underrepresented. Students will be engaged in multidisciplinary topics?advanced controls and reliability analysis techniques of power electronic systems in modern power grids with the integration of renewables?trained to conduct innovative STEM projects with broad impacts on the energy sector?s reliability, resilience, and efficiency. They will be exposed to cutting-edge laboratories, unique reliability analysis tools, and international training to prepare them for national and international careers. This program will facilitate a unique knowledge/experience transfer mechanism, help students build international ties and confidence, and pave the way for future NSF and Danish National Research Foundation collaborations.<br/><br/>Looking to the power system workforce of the future, our students need to understand and analyze different power systems as they may be involved in various projects worldwide while working at national or international companies with technical teams in the U.S. Also, power systems are rapidly and increasingly globalizing and modernizing in response to global policies driven by climate change. In the IRES work, students will conduct cohort-based research projects associated with ac/dc power electronic converters [voltage-source converters (VSCs)] in a possible globe-spanning supergrid (GS2G)?an essential component of the energy sector to integrate renewables to respond to urgent environmental concerns caused by global warming at an alarming rate and international agreements. Under the umbrella of smart grids, they assess and improve the reliability of VSCs with innovative controls in GS2G. The proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge related to 1) enhancing the stability and performance of VSCs in GS2G, 2) integrating renewables into power and energy systems via GS2G?s ac/dc grids, 3) achieving more reliable energy exchange and secure power transfer through VSCs, and 4) employing state-of-the-art technologies to test VSC performance and reliability. In this collaboration, students will rigorously investigate technical aspects of VSCs with advanced controls and reliability analysis techniques for GS2G?s VSCs.

Synthesizing CPSs with assurance is a daunting task: On the one hand, the interconnected networks, sensors, and (semi-) autonomous systems introduce unprecedented vulnerabilities to both cyber- and physical spaces; On the other hand, purposeful attacks may aim to compromise more complex system properties beyond traditional stability and safety. For example, in a robotized security patrol system, a successful cyber-attack on the sensor network can be combined with adversarial control commands to compromise the system and disrupt its mission. In this project, the goal is to develop intelligent sensing and control methods for CPSs that leverage advanced cyber defense techniques for constructing provably secured systems subject to high-level complex mission objectives.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this project will develop formal modeling and solutions for a class of CPS Games, featured by multi-stage, strategic interactions between a controller/defender and a (coordinated cyber- and physical-) attacker. The synthesis of CPS control/defense strategies will explicitly account for asymmetric information and investigate how to leverage cyber defense and deception for guaranteed performance in mission-critical CPSs. The fundamental theory and algorithms will be validated via both a physical testbed including multiple mobile robots and a wireless sensor network and a simulation as a virtual proving ground. The technical contributions are: 1) to develop solutions of imperfect information games with temporal logic objectives and employ the solutions to design control and information acquisition strategies for CPSs under attacks; 2) to investigate the use of cyber defense techniques for gaining defender information advantages against CPS attackers in the synthesis of integrated cyber-physical defense; 3) to develop control strategies against coordinated cyber- and physical- attacks, and novel control methods that incorporate human?s preference for CPS resilience against prior unknown attacks.

It is therefore key to better understand the distribution and behavior of natural sources of methane emissions and how both may change in an evolving climate. In the Arctic, large reservoirs of methane are currently trapped as permafrost (frozen soil) or gas hydrates (an ice-like substance that contains methane in its structure) on Arctic Ocean continental shelves. As the Arctic warms, permafrost and gas hydrates may degrade, releasing more methane to the atmosphere. This project, part of the United States? contribution to the international Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS), is determining whether rates of Arctic methane release from those natural sources are being affected by the present warming by measuring methane in Arctic Ocean from northern Alaska to the North Pole. The team is focusing especially on how much methane released from the seafloor reaches the water surface and adds to atmospheric methane. The team is sharing methane data and other results with the larger US SAS effort and teaching community college students about seagoing research methods and climate change.<br/> <br/>This project is testing the hypothesis that a warming Arctic Ocean may have accelerated the release of methane from permafrost and gas hydrate dissociation in shelf and slope sediments. The research team is measuring water column dissolved methane concentrations and stable isotopologues, as well as continuous measurements of methane in air underway along a transect from the Alaska Shelf northward. The team members are investigating the sources and processes controlling the presence of methane using methane 13C and 2H stable isotopes. Clumped isotopes of methane in air are being analyzed on selected samples identified as possible methane endmembers in the Arctic system. The project is a US contribution to the international Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) and is providing a baseline for measurements in the future of Arctic conditions. The measurement of the stable isotope 2H-CH4 in the Arctic Basin is the first performed in deep Arctic waters and is greatly improving our understanding of the Arctic methane cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project deals with the recent resurgence of integrable systems in the context of algebraic geometry and representation theory, motivated by the study of quantum field theories. The results of the research are expected to elucidate the phenomenon of three-dimensional mirror symmetry originally discovered in theoretical physics. Broader impacts include establishing an interdisciplinary program for mathematics and physics students. The project contains undergraduate and graduate student research topics and aims for vertical integration of research and education. The PI will also co-organize several conferences designed for early-career researchers. The project is jointly funded by the Geometric Analysis program, the Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project deals with the geometric realization of several points of view on the Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable systems. One approach uses quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations emerging naturally in the enumerative geometry of Nakajima quiver varieties. Another one relies on the study of QQ-systems, generalizing the relations satisfied by the Baxter operators. The geometric realization of QQ-systems is derived from the properties of the difference equation version of oper connections on the projective line, generalizing the correspondence between oper connections and Bethe equations for the Gaudin model. The PI plans to show how these geometric points of view on the Bethe ansatz are bonded together within the framework of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence.

Cancer cells can often grow and form tumors for nearly ten years before they are initially detected. This project focuses on producing a minimally invasive and cost-effective, point of care device for early cancer screening. This device is intended to help detect specific cancers earlier, thereby improving patient outcomes globally. If successful, the product is expected to have major economic impacts as a result of reducing  healthcare expenditures for cancer treatment and improving the health of the workforce.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a point of care blood biopsy device for early screening and detection of cancer. The technology consists of two primary components: (1) a disposable microfluidics platform, and (2) an electronics and hardware enclosure. The microfluidic platform fractionates a tiny whole blood sample drawn from the patient and processes a targeted, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  The assay  produces a chemiluminescent signal in response to the presence of circulating tumor cells that have epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression of >80% (i.e. breast, prostate, bladder, or pancreatic cancer). The disposable microfluidic platform is loaded into a table-top sized enclosure that houses the electronics and hardware used to autonomously control fluid handling (sorting, mixing, flushing, sensing) of the blood sample in a preprogrammed sequence. A photosensor contained in the enclosure detects the chemiluminescent signal produced by the assay. By reducing the time and skill typically required by medical personnel, patient outcomes can be improved and the cost of screening can be significantly reduced  The size, cost, and ease of use of the device is well suited for point-of-care diagnostics in a clinical setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, like a canary in a coal mine, host switching by symbionts may reveal emerging risk factors leading to infectious diseases in hosts. On the other hand, extinction of symbionts inform can inform us about the impacts of environmental change. Information on symbionts diversity is limited, however, since they are relatively understudied organisms. This project investigates lizards and their haemosporidian symbionts in sub-Saharan Africa. Haemosporida is a diverse group of vector-borne protozoan symbionts found in terrestrial vertebrates in almost all world ecosystems. Although some species have been studied because of their link to malaria in birds and humans, haemosporidian symbionts in African lizards are poorly known. This project provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Local assemblages of African lizards include sets of taxa differing in degree of ecological and phylogenetic distinctiveness. Unlike birds, lizards do not disperse broadly, and local assemblages are less diverse. These characteristics reduce bias in host species censuses, allowing us to test hypotheses about the factors driving host/symbiont biodiversity. Thus, this study aims to (1) advance our understanding of Haemosporida species delimitation by formalizing an approach that integrates morphological, molecular, and ecological data, (2) generate new knowledge on the processes driving haemosporidian species diversity by studying newly detected Haemosporida species in host clades across their distribution in distinct biomes, (3) enrich biodiversity sciences by developing standards for symbiont-host data integration, and (4) generate knowledge on the regional herpetofauna with new specimens and metadata. This study will provide new insights into regional evolutionary and ecological processes by considering Haemosporida as true elements of biodiversity rather than as traits or pathogens of their hosts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, microfabrication technology used for manufacturing electronics has been adapted to create extremely fine-scale roughness on boiling surfaces, tremendously enhancing their heat transfer performance. However, all surfaces are prone to contamination that can cause physical and chemical changes on the surface. This can lead to dramatic, unpredictable shifts in their performance, with the result that the margin of safety from overheating and failure becomes unknown during long-term operation. The present study develops a new framework for understanding the boiling process that enables assessment of the safety margin in real time, even as the surface degrades. Besides improving safety, this may promote adoption of more advanced heat transfer enhancement techniques, while providing a better fundamental understanding of the boiling phenomenon.  As part of the project, an exhibit appropriate for middle schoolers will be developed jointly with the Bell Museum of Minnesota, to illustrate chaotic phenomena such as the ?butterfly effect?, which has certain parallels with the chaotic boiling process. The PI will also develop modules for outreach activities that bring middle school students to campus for STEM-oriented workshops.  <br/><br/>The proposed research will develop a model for the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) phenomenon, in which a vapor film blanketing the surface leads to thermal runaway. The model will seek to reproduce observed nonlinear phenomena such as intermittency of measured quantities. A theoretical framework will be developed that enables non-dimensionalization of the boiling curve, leading to a more universal understanding of the conditions leading to CHF. Specifically, nucleation site interactions will be incorporated into bubble growth models in order to reproduce the experimentally observed intermittency in quantities. This intermittency is expected to give rise to long-term temporal correlations that can be represented by the Hurst exponent. Experimental data will be analyzed using a multifractal framework, and are expected to display the predicted universal behavior, independent of system parameters. The study will explore whether the Hurst exponent behavior is independent of surface roughness, allowing it to be used as a real-time observable quantity that acts as a signature of impending failure. In order to understand the reasons for the observed trends and assist in model development, the wicking flow under a departing bubble will be characterized using high-speed thermometry and total internal reflection microscopy. These will yield further information on conditions immediately preceding the onset of CHF and dryout.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for improved and more comfortable respirators includes healthcare providers, firefighters, military medical personnel, and everyday citizens. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of new masks to prevent exposure to disease and infection. The mask leverages electrohydrodynamic technology to create a novel air pressurizing device that surpasses other personal protection equipment in terms of size, weight, and comfortability, while maintaining a high filtration efficiency. The unique advantage of this design is that the mask filters out all particles in both exhaling and inhaling cycles without touching the skin of the wearer?s face. The filtering action takes place along the entire perimeter of the mask, a few millimeters away from the face. Particles and droplets present in the air are removed with electrostatic forces. A comfortable headband keeps the mask in place, and it matches the comfort of a well-fitted bicycle helmet. Since the innovation is designed to avoid contact with the wearer?s face, it eliminates bruising while feeling lighter (at about 454 grams). This technology has been shown to be more comfortable to wear than other personal protection equipment. With the addition of a clear face shield, this mask does not obstruct the face of the wearer and those who are hearing impaired can communicate through lip reading. Furthermore, the mask can be sterilized and is reusable, so as to reduce environmental waste.

Computer modeling studies will be conducted to address deficiencies in our knowledge of the nature and effectiveness of the intensification process that operates when there exists markedly asymmetric convection linked to substantial misalignment of the mid-level and low-level cyclonic circulations (tilt). Changes to the asymmetric state that are required for a fast intensification mechanism to supersede a slow mechanism, and the time scale for such changes to occur under a variety of environmental conditions will be elucidated. Knowledge gained from this project will assist complementary efforts to improve the accuracy of operational intensification forecasts that determine the preparations needed to adequately mitigate damage to coastal or island communities that lie in the predicted path of a tropical cyclone. In addition to offering new insights relevant to forecasting, this project will support student internships that will contribute to the development of the next generation of atmospheric scientists.<br/><br/>The research strategy will entail a combination of reduced and full-physics modeling studies. The reduced modeling studies will add parameterized diabatic forcing to the dry primitive equations primarily to represent the heating associated with convection concentrated downtilt of the lower tropospheric vortex center. A variety of intensification mechanisms are expected to exist over the expansive multidimensional parameter space of the diabatic forcing, the state of the vortex, and the environmental vertical wind shear. The spectrum of possibilities ranges from very slow asymmetric modes of spinup to a fast mode associated with core reformation. The domain of applicability for each distinct intensification mechanism will be determined through extensive numerical experiments. Theoretical formulas will be sought for the hypersurfaces that separate regions of parameter space in which different intensification mechanisms operate. The full-physics simulations will be used to elucidate the moist thermo-fluid dynamics governing the convection that drives each intensification mechanism, and to elucidate the processes that lead a tropical cyclone to transition from slow to fast spinup. The sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear will be varied to uncover an assortment of transition-types and the environments in which they occur. Many of the transitions are expected to transpire through contraction or shear-relative reorientation of the tilt vector that characterizes the misalignment of the tropical cyclone. Thus, to better understand what controls the timing of a transition to fast spinup, a sizeable part of this project will involve analyzing how diabatic processes regulate the decay and precession rates of the tilts of the simulated tropical cyclones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vacuum technology is a critical enabling technology that combines complex concepts in mathematics, chemistry and physics in support of advanced manufacturing and research. Vacuum systems remove air and water vapor from an enclosed environment to create a pressure condition many orders of magnitude less than atmospheric pressure. Although vacuum technology plays an integral role in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing and space technology and research, its significance is largely unrecognized by the public. Manufacturing and research organizations utilize expensive vacuum systems, equipment worth tens of millions of dollars, with expectations that the systems function around the clock. Unanticipated downtime due to a vacuum system malfunction is extremely costly. Organizations rely on technicians who possess the knowledge and skills to maintain and repair these systems. Technicians are responsible for quickly troubleshooting and correctly diagnosing issues with the vacuum system performance in order to minimize disruptions in system operation as well as preserve the integrity of the process and product affected by the system. This project will enhance the curricula in vacuum technology and create targeted support services to benefit students, especially incumbent workers, so they are motivated to persist in this program of study to develop the knowledge and skills valued by organizations that utilize vacuum systems. <br/><br/>This project proposes a combination of activities in the areas of program development and improvement and curriculum and educational materials development. The disciplinary focus is vacuum technology, an area of study vital to semiconductor fabrication, nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing and research. The objectives of the project are to: 1) Incorporate cross-disciplinary learning opportunities into the curriculum to better prepare technicians for the future of work; 2) Offer shorter length modules with more entry points and provide more flexibility in the sequence of module completion; and 3) Implement student support strategies that increase student persistence and completion of a credential and successful transition to the workforce, particularly for nontraditional-aged students, individuals underrepresented in vacuum technologies, veterans, and dislocated workers. The project will advance knowledge and understanding of the cross-disciplinary STEM competencies required for vacuum technicians in the era of Industry 4.0. Offering the new modularized courses is a strategy to address some of the barriers to entering vacuum technology by opening up access to courses at times and durations better suited for nontraditional-aged learners. Individuals will be able to access courses through a combination of asynchronous and synchronous courses that can be offered virtually or face-to-face. The project will contribute to our understanding of how to provide technicians with just-enough instruction in cross-disciplinary STEM skills to allow them to transition into today?s workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation?s economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, molecules known as cyclotetrabenzoins (pioneered by Prof. Miljanic in 2015) will be used to include the carbon dioxide molecule within their square-shaped internal cavities. In this cavity, a molecule of carbon dioxide will be stabilized by the equidistant [pi···pi] interactions with the four benzene walls of the cyclotetrabenzoin macrocycle. Second, dynamic combinatorial chemistry will be used to identify molecular species that bind carbon dioxide strongly through the dynamic amplification of such species during reversible reactions.

The cycads are widely considered the world?s most endangered plants with most of the 380 living species considered threatened by extinction according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature?s Red List of Threatened Species. These early plants are often termed living fossils because of their ancient origin over 300 million years ago and their prevalence during the age of the dinosaurs, a time in which they were much more widespread and diverse than they are today. The surviving cycads are particularly valuable for studying plant evolution because of their excellent fossil record. Even though they have changed little in outward appearance, these plants have many unique features, some of which are ancestral (primitive) and some of which are derived (advanced). To save them from extinction, we need to understand when those changes occurred through time and correlate them with environmental changes and other biotic factors. Furthermore, the chemistry of modern cycads is unique and has significant implications for human health, particularly in neurobiology. In a way, cycads serve as a Rosetta stone for plant evolution. This project will synthesize all available data on cycad biology and make those data accessible, via a web site, to a broad audience of researchers as well as to the community of people who are interested in and able to contribute significantly to cycad conservation efforts. <br/><br/>This project will generate a complete, modern e-monograph and data repository of the Cycads. Many avenues of research will be opened in the areas of taxonomy, biogeography, genomics, and evolutionary biology. This e-monograph, hosted by The World List of Cycads, will serve to provide the resources, background, and basics for those pursuits. It will include original species descriptions, type specimens, synonyms, invalid and illegitimate nomenclature, and all published nomenclature at various taxonomic levels. There will be modern, parallel descriptions of all taxa accompanied by photographs and line art, as well as identification tools, distribution maps, habitat data with historic and contemporary photographs, ecology, structural data, chemical data, life cycle information, and phenology and pollination biology when known. The e-monograph will also include an illustrated glossary and sections on ethnobotany, vernacular names, phytochemistry, growth and development, and nitrogen fixation.

Aging is accompanied by a significant reduction in mobility. Existing treatments and therapies rely on respiratory measurements of walking effort. These respiratory measurements can only quantify the average effort of walking. As a result of this limitation, existing treatments and therapies sometimes fail to target the phases of the walking motion that need the most assistance. This project will use data-driven approaches and models to overcome limitations in the ability to measure the effort of walking. Access to this new information will enable evaluating how therapies affect different stages of motion. The data-driven methods will be initially developed using a dataset generated by a computer walking models with physically induced changes to specific stages of motion. For example, forward-pulling forces will be applied to the waist of the model to induce changes that can be leveraged to detect the fluctuations in walking effort. This computer walking model provides access to a complete measure of the effort required for walking, which will be used to validate the data-driven methods. Next, the new data-driven methods will be validated using measurements from real human walking experiments. In these human experiments, pulling forces will be applied by a robotic tether connected to the waist of the participant to induce changes that will be used to detect the effort of the different motion stages. In the final studies, the methods will be used to determine how the effort required for walking differs in younger and older adults. The differences in the effort will be characterized in each stage of motion using human experiments with both younger and older adults. The outcomes of this project will help lead to the creation of enhanced treatments and assistive devices that improve all stages of motion. Throughout this project, the investigators will provide courses for older adults on the mechanics and health aspects of walking and data science and digital engineering through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to leverage new data-driven approaches to characterize differences in metabolic cost of phases of the gait cycle in old versus young adults. The project will combine novel, data-driven approaches based on system identification and robotic perturbations to characterize the time profile of signals that cannot be measured directly, such as metabolic cost. The first objective will produce the time profile of metabolic cost within simulated gait data. Novel data-driven approaches will be developed based on weighted regression, neural networks, and autoencoders to identify the metabolic cost time profile from biomechanical signals. Initially, these methods will be created in a predictive walking simulation from which the metabolic time profile is fully known, such that the new methods can be evaluated during their development. The second objective will evaluate different time profile estimation approaches in human experiments. The methods created in the first objective will be tested using human experiments with robotic perturbations. The capacity of using the data-driven methods to detect changes in swing and push-off will also be investigated using human experiments where elastic ankle tethers or added mass are used to introduce direct changes to the gait cycle. The third objective will characterize the differences in cost contributions of the phases of the gait cycle between older and younger adults. The first subtask will characterize the phase-specific differences in metabolic cost by applying the data-driven methods to compute the instantaneous costs using measured data from younger and older adults. The second subtask will determine the generalizability of the data-driven time-profile estimation approaches across different populations. This research will transform gait analysis by providing access to dynamic metabolic cost time profiles, which cannot be measured using existing techniques. Access to this new information will lead to improvements across multiple biomechanics applications, including (1) diagnosis of motion impairments, (2) prescription of targeted assistive devices, and (3) targeted rehabilitation exercises.  <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering Program (DARE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The in silico computational models developed can also be used to expedite the development of accurate and precise countermeasures. The planned studies will provide opportunities to train engineering and biomedical science students who work collaboratively through highly interdisciplinary (engineering, molecular biology, virology and pharmacology) research studies and will enhance ongoing education and outreach activities focused on attracting underrepresented minority groups into these areas of research.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to engineer an innovative, biodegradable, nanobarrier (anti viral coating) that is safe and can be widely deployed to protect the public from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although traditional approaches like vaccines, mask mandates, and social distancing are being used to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19, long-term compliance is a challenge. Therefore, a novel approach to infection prevention is urgently needed. This project proposes a user-friendly nanobarrier designed to prevent viral and microbial attachment and infection of epithelial cells by enhancing the defense capabilities of the mucocutaneous lining found in nasopharyngeal passages. The nanobarrier inactivates enveloped viruses by sequestering essential cholesterols required for viral attachment, infection, and transmission. This project has two major objectives: (1) to use 3D-simulation of the nasopharyngeal cavity to optimize the parameters (droplet and delivery product characteristics) to guide the engineering of an applicator for accurate deposition of the nanobarrier to areas most susceptible to COVID-19 infection, facilitating translation into preclinical models, and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the nanobarrier in a validated coronavirus mouse model. The final nanobarrier will be agnostic to SARS-CoV-2 variants and can be quickly rolled-out to effectively prevent infection. The simulation approach used in this project will serve as a platform to develop targeted interventions with optimized delivery into the nasopharyngeal cavity. Additionally, this project will expand knowledge and understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 variants infect as well as their susceptibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. While learning new research skills, the fellow will use a marine worm to explore a major source of biodiversity. Different populations of animals sometimes begin to evolve differences in how their offspring develop. These population differences can set the stage for the evolution of new biodiversity. They can even lead to the origins of new species. Whether this happens depends on whether members of the diverging populations can still mate and produce offspring. A common barrier to such matings consists of female mate preferences for males with the same developmental traits. Such preferences can reduce chance matings between divergent populations and allow them to diverge further. Thus, they can be major sources of biodiversity. Yet, how these preferences arise is largely unknown. Using genomics, molecular techniques, and behavioral assays, this research aims to uncover the genomic makeup of such mate preferences. In addition, the fellow will develop K-12 lessons, perform public outreach, and mentor students using research data.<br/><br/>The fellow will use the model marine worm system Streblospio benedicti to investigate the role of female mate choice in the divergence of populations that differ in developmental type. In some populations, S. benedicti females produce many small, obligately feeding larvae. In other populations, they produce many fewer, much larger offspring that can develop to adulthood via maternal provisioning. Intermediate developmental types are nearly never found in nature. Yet, they are readily produced in the lab by breeding adults of opposite types. This suggests selection acts against such intermediates in nature. Preliminary evidence suggests female S. benedicti preferentially mate with adult males who had the same larval form as them. Thus, it is possible that a behavioral, prezygotic mating barrier is contributing to population divergence in developmental type. The fellow will use crosses and whole-genome sequencing of females with different mating preferences to pursue this possibility. This research will identify the genetic basis for mate preferences in this system and its association with developmental type and population divergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The diverse and complex climate and geography of Hawaii presents unique challenges to measure and gather reliable data to properly monitor weather-related events. These events have been enhanced in frequency and intensity due to the accelerated change in climate. While data at a larger scale is currently available, there is lack of sufficient downscaled products in Hawaii to facilitate modeling of climate impacts, alternative energy planning, and improvement of present-day weather forecasts. Climate science depends on data science, analytics, and visualization to close data gaps, and to develop actionable science and models which in turn will support Hawaii?s transition to a data-driven, ?smart? economy. Change(HI) is committed to producing actionable science resulting from data/climate interdisciplinary research. At the same time, the project seeks to train a workforce in computational and climate science that would help diversify and regenerate the Hawaiian economy, which is dependent on tourism. Change(HI) will consolidate participants from four Hawaii's higher education institutions: University of Hawaii Manoa, University of Hawaii Hilo, University of Hawaii West Oahu, and Chaminade University. The project will establish multi-campus and multidisciplinary teams in areas such as data science, climate science, cyberinfrastructure, education, and workforce development. Change(HI) will position Hawaii to ?harness the data revolution? to confront climate change and support the state?s economic diversification. <br/><br/>Hawaii is currently considered underserved in climate analysis products because national analyses and monitoring networks are often restricted, resulting in data gaps and information scarcity for decision making in Hawaii. In addition, the diverse topography of the islands as well as the dynamic climate make it difficult to obtain the high-resolution data needed to obtain reliable outcomes from different predicting models. The Change Hawaii: Harnessing the Data Revolution for Island Resilience [Change(HI)] project proposes to obtain the necessary data by using current and new sensors and generating the proper downscaling climate products. The data will be easily accessible for the various stakeholders through a data portal that is currently operational and will be upgraded to handle the new climate information. Change(HI) will focus on identifying critical gaps that are not duplicative of ongoing and highly funded efforts in areas such as seawater inundation, coastal ecology, coral resilience, and storms. The research plan is divided into four focused themes: 1) monitoring, visualizing and communicating change; 2) predicting and simulating regional climate change; 3) ecohydrology of change; 4) characterizing land-use change tradeoffs. Change(HI) will deliver fundamental and actionable advances in the science of climate change for Hawaii, including data products, collection strategies, and analysis tools that will be applicable to other Pacific islands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faculty are central to the success of higher education, and through teaching, research, and service, faculty contribute to the education of the future workforce in STEM, the advancement of knowledge, and the success of the higher education enterprise. Since 2004, when data was last collected for the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF), there has been no source of nationally representative data on faculty. Two major developments have also meaningfully changed the landscape for academic employment, particularly in STEM. First, the academic labor force is increasingly contingent, including a substantial increase in the number of non-tenure-track faculty (NTTF). Second, there have been substantial investments into efforts to increase the number of faculty from groups historically underrepresented in STEM (race/ethnicity, disability, gender, and socio-economically disadvantaged). Thus, the discontinuation of NSOPF has resulted in a significant gap in knowledge about postsecondary faculty in the United States. The lack of good information on faculty members? identities, careers, working conditions, and outcomes handicaps administrators and policymakers in supporting faculty success. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop and test the Faculty, Academic Careers, and Environments (FACE) survey, an updated and expanded version of NSOPF that can provide a contemporary understanding of postsecondary faculty in the United States, including who they are and how their working conditions shape their opportunity to be effective scientists and educators.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to design the research methods and infrastructure for FACE and to conduct a field test to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of project processes and products to facilitate success at scale. Achieving nationally representative data on faculty requires a complex, two-stage sample. At the institution level, researchers aim to (1) create and validate a stratified sampling frame, (2) conduct focus groups with institutional data providers from different institutional contexts to inform data collection instruments and formats, (3) determine methods and processes for collecting institutional data on faculty, (4) develop the institutional data repository and questionnaire to collect accurate data about faculty, and (5) collect and analyze pilot data from a sample of roughly 10% of eligible institutions. At the faculty level, researchers aim to (1) create and validate a faculty-level sample frame, (2) determine methods and processes for collecting faculty-level data to facilitate high response rates, (3) identify valid and reliable items and constructs that inform our understanding of academic careers and environments, (4) develop a faculty survey instrument, and (5) collect and analyze pilot data from a nonprobability sample of at least 1,500 faculty respondents. Additionally, this study uses an innovative approach to field testing, decoupling institution-level and faculty-level data collection to allow researchers to collect pilot data at both levels simultaneously.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

Processes that occur at the electrode/solution interface, including bubble formation, play a critical role in electrochemistry. Many electrochemical reactions that are relevant for energy conversion and storage and environmental chemistry are gas-evolving reactions. For example, H2 and O2 are produced from the electrocatalytic water splitting. Despite its key importance, the early stage of bubble formation remains challenging to study due to the lack of proper imaging tools with sufficient sensitivity and resolution. In this project, the Zhang group is developing a single-molecule fluorescence imaging approach to probe the surface of nanobubbles in order to further understand the chemical nature of the nanoscale gas/solution interface. The research seeks an improved understanding of electrocatalytic reactions that will enable the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. This project provides unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students in the areas of electrochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, nanotechnology, and energy storage.<br/><br/>The measurements being developed in this project seek a better understanding of the chemical environment at the gas/solution interface of nanobubbles. Toward this goal, the research team led by Professor Zhang analyzes the dynamic adsorption and desorption processes of single fluorophores. They are working to extract a series of key kinetic parameters including the adsorption equilibrium constant, adsorption and desorption kinetic constants, and the sticking probability for molecules at the interface. They use solvatochromic dye molecules to probe the polarity of the interface. Moreover, the research team will image single nanobubbles generated on nanoelectrodes to better correlate fluorescence signal with bubble size and shape.  The research promises to offer new insights on the chemical and physical nature of the gas/solution interface of nanoscale bubbles that has important implications for developments in clean energy and other catalytic processes. The use of nanoelectrodes and their arrays will enable a better understanding of mass-transfer effects in bubble nucleation. In addition to the scientific impacts of the work, the project provides advanced training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is an evidence-based approach to teaching and learning in which students work in teams on specifically designed activities facilitated by instructors. It has been shown that POGIL can reduce student attrition and improve student understanding. However, instructors can be hesitant to adopt POGIL due to a lack of training, the significant development time for creating POGIL activities, and the lack of effective support tools for facilitating and monitoring student team activity. This project will train and support instructors to implement POGIL learning activities using the web-based platform and the activities in their courses. This study will examine how instructors use the platform in their classes, how the platform affects student behavior during the activities, and how the platform affects student motivation and learning. This project will support a set of instructors as they migrate their activities and classes into the platform, which can be used in face-to-face, hybrid, or online settings.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance the adoption of POGIL activities in STEM courses so that students will have better learning outcomes. The team learning approach supported by this project is grounded in the theory of social constructivism. Students learn STEM concepts as they interact with their peers and the instructor in the context of a well designed activity that engages students in active learning. The team plans to recruit, train, and support 14 POGIL practitioners from multiple STEM disciplines and contexts to adapt, pilot, and assess learning activities. New capabilities will be implemented for an existing web-based platform that will provide rich feedback and access to numerous learning activities. The project will address three research questions: (1) How do instructors use the platform to support their implementation of POGIL? (2) How does the POGIL implementation affect student behavior during the POGIL activities? (3) How does using POGIL with the platform affect student motivation and learning? These questions will be answered by analyzing interviews, surveys, student performance data, and platform usage data. An activity migration rubric will be developed and validated to assess how well the platform supports each POGIL activity and identify when changes are needed to the platform to address limitations, enhance accessibility, and add new capabilities.

Of particular interest are words like ""that"" above, called ""complementizers."" A great deal of work has been dedicated to the role of a complementizer. What function does a complementizer play in linking together sentences, and to what extent does this function vary across languages? This project expands the general understanding of sentences-within-sentences by focusing on variation within a subfamily of languages. Among these languages, there is a wide range of strategies for embedding a sentence in another sentence, including multiple (sometimes upwards of five) different complementizers in a single language. This project rigorously documents and analyzes the function of these different complementizers via detailed interviews with native speakers, and thereby increases the broader understanding of this complex sentence type. This research adds to the empirical basis for our theorizing about how human language works and develops pedagogical resources for the speaker community.<br/><br/>Decades of cross-linguistic work, largely on Indo-European languages, has revealed a number of different factors affecting the relationship between an embedded clause and its associated main clause. Syntactic, semantic, and morphological criteria have all been implicated in determining the clausal embedding strategy. These investigations have resulted in a complex and sometimes inconsistent picture of the syntax and semantics of embedded clauses cross-linguistically. This project addresses these issues by documenting and analyzing variation across closely related languages. Previous descriptive work has revealed significant inter-language, and in some cases, inter-speaker variation. This project focuses on variation as a means to address some of the long-standing puzzles about embedded clauses. It also contributes to diaspora and marginalized language communities, creating pedagogical resources and highlighting some of the communities who speak unofficial ""dialects"" that have previously received little recognition or documentation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transforming global agriculture practices is critical to meet current and future food demands in the face of climate change, and necessary to minimize environmental impacts that damage terrestrial and aquatic environments, and ultimately affect human health and well-being. Current practices used to increase crop yields rely heavily on fertilizers that threaten the environment and weaken crop resilience. Understanding and harnessing the diverse properties of microorganisms that live in the soil near the roots of crops (called the rhizosphere) has the potential to help find new, more sustainable farming strategies. This research project seeks to understand a specific microbial process that has the potential to help plants better access phosphorus in soil. The investigator will determine if certain compounds released by bacteria (for example, phenazines) that liberate mineral-bound phosphorus can make a difference to plant nutrition. The results of this work have the potential to provide alternative strategies enabling the reduction of synthetic fertilizer application and increased phosphorus bioavailability for plants.  This project will directly broaden participation of groups underrepresented in biology by enabling the research of a Latinx postdoctoral fellow in Biology who will engage other underrepresented scholars through mentoring in the lab. The fellow will also work with the non-profit Clean Water Science Network?s virtual mentorship program to increase the network and mentorship skills of postdoctoral scholar participants at Caltech and around the country.<br/><br/>The fellow will test the hypothesis that microbially secreted phenazines can solubilize iron-mineral-adsorbed phosphate by reductive dissolution, subsequently enhancing plant bioavailability and uptake.

The proposed research will elucidate the understanding of tornadogenesis, which is crucial to make a proper tornado warning issue, thereby avoiding catastrophic damage and casualties. <br/><br/>This project will develop conservative, discrete maximum principle preserving, and efficient numerical schemes that can be used for simulating coupled flow and transports that arise in important areas of research, such as complex fluids and tornadoes. These new methods will be analyzed mathematically and enhanced by using a class of new fast solvers to drastically reduce the complexity of computational bottlenecks. The framework developed by the PI in this project will enable researchers to tackle a wide spectrum of physical parameters that have been elusive for computational rheologists for decades. Compatible window-wise physics informed neural network will be attempted to solve regularized complex fluids. The project will present a new tornado model for the understanding of extreme micro-weather patterns in vapor-to-particle reaction, convection, and diffusion. In particular, this project will elucidate and fill the gap between mathematical modeling and phenomena of tornadoes, thereby deepening the understanding of tornadogenesis. A data-driven deep neural networks will be designed for determining the unknown physical parameters in the tornado model as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A less-known application for magnetism is in refrigeration technology through a mechanism called the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). A magnetic refrigerator is similar to regular refrigerators, except instead of compressing and decompressing a gas, it magnetizes and demagnetizes a solid-state material to create the low temperatures. Materials used for this application typically contain rare-earth elements, for example gadolinium and erbium. These elements are expansive and not readily available, especially not in the U.S.. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Mater Physics program in the Division of Materials Research, the researchers at Boston College synthesize new materials that exhibit a giant MCE and contain only minimal amounts of rare-earth elements. In this way the project addresses critical aspects of sustainability by eliminating ozone-depleting refrigeration gases and by minimizing the rare-earth content of the magnetocaloric materials. This interdisciplinary project provides a platform for training the next generation of materials scientists with a deep understanding of quantum chemistry and the ability to implement fundamental science to solve the societal problems. Additionally, this project provides career workshops for pre-college students from underrepresented minorities in the Boston area and research opportunities for students from Jackson State University, a HBCU.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Materials that exhibit a magnetocaloric effect (MCE), the reversible change of temperature as a function of magnetic field, provides a sustainable platform for refrigeration technology. Magnetic refrigerators are considerably less energy consuming than regular refrigerators and do not rely on ozone-depleting gases. The main challenge for commercializing magnetic refrigerators is the lack of materials with a large refrigeration capacity (RC) made from earth-abundant elements. Giant magnetocaloric materials are either made from toxic elements such as P and As, or have a large rare-earth content. As such, the synthesis of giant magnetocaloric materials that are non-toxic and have little to no rare-earth content is a critical aspect of sustainability. With this support researchers from Boston College synthesize such materials by following two chemical design principles, namely narrow bandwidths and competing exchange interactions. The narrow bandwidth leads to a magnetic transition near room temperature via the Stoner mechanism. The critical temperature can be adjusted by doping, which enables the design of multi-stage magnetic refrigerators. Competing exchange interactions broaden the magnetic transition and lead to entropy release over a wide temperature range, thereby enhancing RC. The investigated materials have less than ten per cent rare-earth content. The researchers elucidate novel mechanisms for achieving giant MCE in these materials with minimal rare-earth content. The educational impacts include the engagement of underrepresented students in a multidisciplinary research project between chemistry and physics as well as training students at the national high-magnetic field and synchrotron radiation facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to develop catalysts based upon readily available main group elements as alternatives to traditional industrial catalysts that are often based upon rare and expensive transition metals. The key target in this research is a class of compounds called dithiolenes that contains two sulfur atoms and can accept and/or donate electrons in chemical reactions. Since the ability to provide or accept electrons is one of the key properties of most transition metal catalysts, the use of dithiolenes to perform a number of industrially important processes will be evaluated.

The PI will continue his efforts to  extend the chemistry research enterprise to women and African Americans.<br/><br/>This project will synthesize a number of main group-based dithiolene radicals and explore their structure and reactivity. An important goal is to ascertain if main group-based dithiolene radicals can activate small, energy-rich molecules. Specifically, a set of Lewis base-stabilized dithiolene zwitterions (LO) will be prepared. These will be used to explore: (a) the activation of small molecules using LO, (b) the thermally or optically induced single electron transfer involving LO, (c) the development of LO-anchored Lewis acid/base pairs, (d) the ""naked"" dithiolene radical-NHSi-polysulfide three-component systems for ring opening of cyclic ethers and esters, (e) magnesium dithiolene radicals, and (f) group 13 and 14 element-based tris(dithiolene) triradicals. The proposed work will attempt to answer several fundamentally important questions, including: Are redox-active ligands capable of activating small molecules in a metal-free environment?

However, the specific processes that alter soil characteristics to increase flooding and erosion are not well understood. Soil sealing is one of the less studied post-wildfire processes because the peak impact of soil sealing occurs immediately after a wildfire when it can be difficult and dangerous to make field observations. However, this time period immediately after a wildfire also holds the highest risk for high damage flooding due to the lack of vegetation. To investigate the soil sealing processes that occur immediately after a wildfire, the investigators in this project will conduct laboratory experiments to simulate rainfall on burned soils and ash materials. The outcomes will provide new information about post-wildfire soil sealing processes with implications for forest management and disaster mitigation. Additionally, this project will support the development of technical skills for four college students and the development of a 4th and 5th grade science lesson on soil erosion.<br/><br/>The overarching research question of this project is: how does the slope angle of a land surface affect soil sealing processes immediately after a wildfire, and how does this impact infiltration for consequent rain events? As slope angle increases, surface ash erosion rates will increase. As a result, it is hypothesized that soil surfaces that experience increased storage of ash will promote soil sealing processes that decrease infiltration during later rain events, thereby increasing runoff. To test this hypothesis, laboratory scale rainfall simulations will be conducted at a range of slope angles on simulated burned soil conditions. Investigators will observe the effect of slope angle by (1) quantifying the effect of slope angle on surface ash erosion and surface storage through rainfall experiments, and (2) determining the effect of ash retention, if any, on soil properties after rainfall experiments. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Hydrologic Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The guiding principles of these technologies will accelerate methods to synthesize high value molecules such as pharmaceutical building blocks while simultaneously reducing the waste and environmental footprint as compared to traditional chemistries. Photochemistry uses light as the driving force to form new chemical bonds. This approach often enables the formation of unique bonds not accessible through simple heating.

However, manually building such expectations into decision-making systems is challenging. At the same time, machine learning has been shown to be successful in extracting representative patterns from training datasets in many related application domains. While the use of machine learning to learn predictive models for decision-making seems promising; the design choices (data sources, forms of supervision, architectures for the predictive models, and interaction of the predictive models with decision-making) are deeply intertwined. As part of this project, investigators will identify the precise aspects in which machine learning benefits navigation and object interaction; and co-design datasets, models, and learning algorithms to build systems that realize these benefits. The project will improve the state-of-the-art of predictive reasoning for navigation and object interaction by designing approaches that can leverage large-scale diverse data sources for training. Models, datasets, and systems developed in this project will advance navigation and mobile manipulation capabilities. These will enable practical downstream applications (e.g., assistive robots, telepresence), and open up avenues for follow-up research (e.g., human-robot interaction). The project will contribute to the education of students and the broader community through curriculum development, engagement in research projects, and accessible dissemination of research.<br/><br/>The project will co-design data collection methods, learning techniques, and policy architectures to enable large-scale learning of predictive models for people, places, and things for problems involving navigation and mobile manipulation. Investigators will tackle the following three research tasks: (1) designing predictive models for people, places, and objects that are necessary for decision making; (2) identifying data sources and generating supervision to learn these predictive models at-scale; and (3) hierarchical and modular policy architectures that effectively use the learned predictive models. Investigators will re-use existing sense-plan-control components (motion planners, feedback controllers) where applicable (e.g., motion in free space), and introduce learning in modules that require speculation (i.e., high-level decision-making modules, e.g., identifying promising directions for exploration, predicting where will an oncoming human go next, what is a good position to open a drawer from).

Ketones are a widespread class of organic molecules that have many applications in chemical manufacturing; however, established methods to derivatize these materials typically require expensive and/or corrosive reagents and lead to the generation of significant waste streams. To overcome such issues, the Dong Research Group is developing environmentally sustainable approaches for the derivatization of ketones that enable direct access to a range of useful products using a combination of specially designed catalysts and simple olefins (inexpensive commodity chemicals). The broader impacts of the funded project extend to societal benefits accrued by the participation of Professor Dong and his coworkers in outreach activities, such as the ""ChiS&E"" program which provides early chemistry education to Chicago public middle-school students, and the Collegiate Scholars Program which allows for high school students to become involved in laboratory research. These activities will encourage a demographically diverse pool of young people, many of whom belong to groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, to explore careers in science and engineering while learning and/or actively contributing to research.<br/><br/>The goal of the funded research is to develop both alpha- and beta-selective ketone-olefin coupling reactions via transition metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization. To achieve the first process, Lewis acid/transition metal cooperative catalysis will be utilized to enable direct alpha-alkylation of the ketone substrates with simple olefins as coupling partners. To realize the second process, beta-alkylation of ketones, again by olefins, will be explored via a transition metal-catalyzed desaturation-based hydride-transfer strategy. An analogous process employing alkynes will likewise be pursued to achieve beta-alkenylation. The merits of these approaches are significant from both fundamental and practical standpoints, thus: (1) stoichiometric byproducts are potentially avoided; (2) the reaction conditions are generally pH- and redox-neutral, thereby tolerating a broad range of functional groups; and, (3) olefins are typically less expensive and more readily available feedstocks than the corresponding alkyl halides or organometallic species. Ultimately, it is anticipated that a suite of operationally convenient and environmentally sustainable carbonyl alkylation methods will emerge from these studies and that the findings will represent important advances to the fields of bifunctional and tandem catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transducing mechanical forces is also essential for senses like touch and hearing. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the cellular protein machineries operate to sense and transduce mechanical forces remain to be elucidated.  The cell-cell adhesion adherens junction (AJ) macromolecular complexes serve as mechanosensing hubs between neighboring cells in multicellular organisms.  Because the AJ complexes are highly flexible, determining their structure and dynamics poses a challenge to molecular biophysics.  This project aims to elucidate the mechanosensing mechanism of the AJ core complex by a novel integrative structural biology approach. Given its interdisciplinary nature, the collaborative research provides multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  Moreover, this research contributes to the development of next generation world class national infrastructure for neutron scattering, and to the community outreach programs to broaden participations in STEM education and research.   <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will employ cutting edge static and dynamic neutron scattering, theoretical physics and molecular simulation to determine the structure and dynamics of the mechanosensitive core complex of the AJ.  With the aid of selective deuteration, neutron scattering, particularly neutron spin echo spectroscopy, can probe the dynamics of macromolecular complexes on nanometer length scales and on nanosecond to microsecond timescales, which fills a largely unexplored spatial-temporal niche between cell biophysics/single molecule spectroscopy and high-resolution structural biology.

Agriculture is also a significant contributor to the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). It is the largest source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a GHG which is about 300 times as potent as CO2 at heating the atmosphere. However, the current N2O emission inventories from agriculture and farming operations, including ISO 14064 and USEPA Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, only track emissions from soil management, manure management, and field burning of agricultural residues. This CAREER project will focus on N2O emissions from forage conservations as an abundant and yet unaccounted source of N2O from agriculture and farming. Forages are plants or parts of plants that serve as feed for livestock.  Forage conservation often relies on fermentation as lactic acid produced from fermentation works as a natural preservative for forage crops. However, microorganisms that produce GHGs can also thrive in conserved forages with preliminary studies by the Principal Investigator (PI) of this CAREER project showing the production of a significant amount of N2O from laboratory incubations of alfalfa, a widely used crop in forage conservation. Building upon the results of these preliminary studies, the PI of this CAREER project proposes to carry out an integrated laboratory and field research program to quantify N2O emissions in forage conservations and investigate the microbial processes that control such emissions. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge to quantify, manage, and mitigate the emissions of a non-CO2 and more potent GHG such as N2O. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate students at Kansas State University.<br/><br/>Forage conservation is a significant and understudied source of potent GHGs such as nitrous oxide (N2O) in agriculture and farming.  The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to quantify and advance the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of N2O emissions from forage conservation processes. The specific objectives of the project laboratory and field studies are to: (1) Quantify and probe the mechanisms of N2O emissions by microorganisms in forage conservations (Objective 1), (2) Develop new strategies to control and manage N2O emissions from forage conservations (Objective 2), and (3) Validate the findings from the lab experiments in field-scale experiments (Objective 3). The successful completion of this research has the potential for transformative impact.  The integrated laboratory and field experiments could contribute to more accurate estimates of N2O fluxes from forage conservations at local, regional, and global scales. The microbiological investigations could produce new fundamental knowledge and open new avenues to develop more effective strategies and solutions to manage and mitigate N2O emissions from forage conservation processes. To advance the education and training goals of this CAREER project, the PI will work with K-State Research and Extension (the Kansas State University Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service) to raise awareness of the environmental impact of GHGs produced from forage conservations among livestock producers through outreach and educational activities. In addition, the PI plans to 1) partner with Future Farmers of America (FFA) to develop a course module on GHG gas emissions and management in farming and livestock production for high school teachers who run FFA programs in rural Kansas and 2) work with the K-State Project Impact staff to encourage and recruit rural students to pursue graduate education in Environmental Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because ozone concentration is higher in the stratosphere than the troposophere the mixing of air between the two, referred to as stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), is an important source of tropospheric ozone.  But the stratospheric contribution is hard to quantify and direct estimates of ozone STE from reanalysis products differ from estimates based on tropospheric ozone budget residuals. A further concern is that estimates of the 40-year STE trend from two prominent reanalysis products (ERA5 and MERRA2) show substantial differences.  <br/><br/>Recently the Principal Investigator (PI) found a potentially important shortcoming of ozone STE calculations, which is that they only consider STE in the middle and high latitudes, where the direction of ozone transport is downward into the troposphere and where the bulk of the ozone STE occurs.  Contrary to expectations he found that the tropical ozone STE, which is upward and thus a loss for the troposphere, cannot be neglected as it reduces the global ozone STE by about 35%. This finding, along with the availability of relevant high-quality satellite observations, warrants a reexamination of ozone STE addressing three questions: 1) what is the ozone STE and associated uncertainty based on observational data? 2) what are the main factors responsible for the large discrepancies in ozone STE from different reanalysis products? 3) How will ozone STE change in a changing climate?<br/><br/>The STE calculations use a methodology in which the tropical tropopause is assumed to lie on an isentropic surface (the 380K isentrope in present-day climate) while the extratropical tropopause lies on a potential vorticity surface (3.5PVU) below the 380K isentrope.  The project uses data from satellite missions including CloudSat, CALYPSO, MODIS, and COSMIC, in combination with radiative transfer codes, to calculate the heating rates and atmospheric density needed to create observational STE estimates.  The work on future STE change examines climate simulations from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative.  One concern is that the stratospheric overturning circulation (the Brewer-Dobson circulation) is expected to strengthen due to greenhouse gas increases, which could lead to an increase in downward ozone STE in the middle and high latitudes.  Another is that the tropical tropopause is expected to rise, which could reduce the loss of ozone to the stratosphere through tropical STE.<br/><br/>The work is of societal interest given the harmful effects of ground-level ozone and the practical value of better estimates of its sources and likely future evolution.  In addition, the PI conducts public outreach including multiple events focusing on K-12 engagement in science.  The PI has also been active in developing data visualization software and techniques, some of which were featured in the American Geophysical Union Data Visualization Competition. In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

States and community college systems across the country are exploring higher education policies and models that systematically award college credit for noncredit learning in applied STEM fields. Statewide articulation agreements that award credit for noncredit learning aim to expand access to high quality teaching and learning in credit-bearing STEM programs and to meet the changing education and workforce needs of a diverse set of learners and workers. In addition to opening up access to applied STEM programs, these statewide articulation agreements help students to save time and money on duplicative coursework, and deliver a message that colleges value and support students with different sources of STEM learning. Recognizing the growth in these new initiatives, scarce literature on these efforts, and limited research on nontraditional students, the project team intends to investigate (1) the characteristics, educational aspirations, and priorities of individuals with noncredit STEM learning; (2) the design and effectiveness of strategies for communicating about educational programs and initiatives with populations of nontraditional learners; (3) the experience of students with noncredit STEM learning as they transition into credit-bearing STEM programs.   <br/> <br/>Working closely with the Ohio Department of Higher Education (ODHE), Ohio Technical Centers (OTCs), Ohio community colleges, and industry representatives (e.g., associations), the RAND team intends to build evidence that will inform the implementation and scale-up of a statewide initiative focused on two types of noncredit learning, vocational coursework earned through a statewide network of technical centers and industry certification and licenses. The project intends to conduct a mixed methods investigation that includes both primary and secondary data collection and analyses. First, the team will conduct a literature review and collect data on individuals with noncredit learning and their education and training decisions to inform the design of outreach approaches to these individuals. Then, the team will rigorously test at least one of these outreach approaches by conducting an experimental or quasi-experimental study and analyzing administrative data. Finally, the team will collect and analyze primary and administrative data to better understand how these initiatives are being implemented within institutions, to explore whether individuals with noncredit learning are leveraging these statewide agreements to enroll in college, and to assess how these individuals are progressing with credit-bearing STEM coursework.

These examples necessarily involve nonlinearity, which is when the rate of change of a quantity depends on the quantity itself.  A simple illustration of nonlinearity is the so-called Allee effect, where the reproduction rate of certain species is negative below a minimum population size, perhaps due to factors such as cooperative defense or mate limitation. Typically, nonlinearities present serious difficulties in the analysis of the model.  In the context of various scientifically relevant classes of partial differential equations, this project aims to develop an understanding of when a model can be approximated by a (simpler) linear one and, more generally, which essential features are required by a minimal model to faithfully represent the essential behavior of the original phenomenon. The intent is to aid scientists to identify and implement the most tractable model for their investigations. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>A focus of the project is to develop technical tools for understanding the fundamental nature of the long-time behavior of several reaction-diffusion equations.  These model systems exhibiting growth (reaction) and spreading (diffusion) in which an interface (front) forms and propagates with a constant speed.  Classically, these systems are divided into two categories based on the underlying mechanism driving the movement of the front: linear behavior far beyond the front ('pulled' fronts) or nonlinear behavior at the front ('pushed' fronts).  Often, the shape and speed of these fronts can depend strongly on intrinsic properties of the system, generally represented by a parameter.  As the parameter changes, the character of the fronts may change from 'pulled' to 'pushed' or vice versa. New advances stemming from the recent introduction of ideas such as relative entropy and quantitative steepness as well as a careful understanding of the regularity of equations have opened the door to a high level of precision in characterizing this pulled-pushed transition.

Cables can be used by multi-robot systems to tug or transport large loads, and robots can use fixed tethers for power supply or communication for long-term missions in GPS-denied environments. Multi-agent systems need new innovations for coordination-free planning in a sociopolitical environment in which privacy concerns are on the rise. Articulated robotic manipulators are used in a variety of industrial applications such as automated manufacturing, as well as in minimally invasive assisted laparoscopic surgery. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project addresses the fundamental question of complexity reduction for such systems with high-dimensional configuration spaces using techniques of topological abstraction with an aim of achieving fast & efficient planning. Integrated with the research objectives of this project are educational plans aimed at training current and future generation of engineers & researchers in the science and technologies of complex autonomous systems that are increasingly becoming part of our modern society. As an integral part of the project, STEM education will be advanced through establishment of a mentoring ecosystem involving graduate, undergraduate & K-12 students. <br/><br/>In this project novel theoretical and algorithmic tools will be developed for achieving topological abstraction of high-dimensional configuration spaces with an aim of allowing efficient optimal path planning for high degree-of-freedom systems using Topological Path Planning methods. Homotopy invariants will be developed for joint configuration spaces of multiple robots navigating on planar domains with obstacles, resulting in complexity reduction in problems involving tethered multi-robot systems, constrained human-robot teams, and planning for large multi-agent systems without coordination. Novel algorithms for efficient computation of homotopy invariants in spatial domains will be developed, leading to direct amalgamation with search-based planning algorithms with application to spatial systems involving cables. The project goes beyond homotopy to develop the theoretical foundations of a deep generalization to the notion of homotopy, which will pave the way for the discovery and computation of novel topological constructions called Reeb structures that are suitable for dimensionality reduction of configuration spaces of articulated and soft robotic manipulators. All these fundamental advances will allow development of efficient path planning algorithms with completeness and optimality guarantees for high degree-of-freedom systems such as spatial, multi-robot systems & human-robot systems involving one or more flexible cables; coordination-free multi-agent systems; and articulated robotic arms & deformable manipulators. The developed algorithms will be implemented and evaluated on real robotic platforms.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The formation of specific cell types plays pivotal roles in all aspects of life, and different tissues are composed of hundreds of types of cells. As one of the underlying mechanisms, the 3D structure of DNA undergoes dynamic reshaping and instructs this complex process. However, it is under-studied and quantitative models are lacking due to the complexity of the system and large amounts of noisy data. The project will establish a novel mathematical framework to understand the dynamics of DNA structures and its effects on new cell type formation. Efficient computational and statistical algorithms will also be designed to discover the molecular drivers, which will be interrogated by cutting-edge experiments. The integrative strategy will lead to new systems-level insights into the molecular mechanisms of the formation of diverse cell types, with broad impacts on human health, synthetic biology and disease analyses, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To expand the societal impacts, the project will integrate the scientific discoveries with a series of outreach activities for public engagement, including new interactive educational modules and platforms. Interdisciplinary hands-on training will be developed for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall goal is to theoretically and quantitatively delineate the functional roles of dynamic 3D genome structures in the process of multi-lineage cell differentiation. Due to the complexity of multi-scale 3D organizations of chromatin, the coupled dynamics of transcription and epigenetic factors, and the high rates of missing data in genome-wide experiments, systems-level modeling of the temporal dynamics of 3D chromatin through specific cell differentiation trajectory has been challenging. The project tackles this fundamental problem using an integrative strategy by combining mathematical, computational, statistical and experimental approaches. Specifically, the project will: 1) establish a new multi-scale mathematical model for the dynamics of 3D chromatin architecture through cell differentiation, by integrating different experimental observations; 2) design novel computational algorithms to reconstruct the trajectories across cell differentiation from large-scale noisy data; and 3) develop efficient statistical inference tools to discover the underlying molecular events of cell fate determination. Both theoretical and computational predictions will be thoroughly analyzed by experimental techniques, including 3C-HTGTS and 3D FISH.  The new methodology generated by the project, along with the genome-wide predictions across diverse panels of cell types, will have broad impacts on multiple scientific fields in both mathematics and biology, and will significantly improve the mechanistic understandings, predictive capacities and experimental engineering of cell differentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Above and beyond urban or industrial use, agriculture is the largest consumer of land and water.  How can plant biology address these existential problems?  One has only to look back, a little over 50 years, to see that the coincidence of changes in farm management practices and plant breeding led to the Green Revolution.  Through simple changes in plant architecture, farmers were better able to take advantage of past innovations in the production of synthetic fertilizers.  These changes are thought to have saved over a billion lives and reduced the rate of deforestation.  The next Green Revolution will require innovations that go beyond these simple solutions.  Increasing yields in an ecologically conscientious manner will involve interdisciplinary teams including basic scientists, breeders, synthetic biologists, and agronomists.  The goal of the Gordon Research Conference on Salt and Water Stress in Plants is to foster sharing of the latest research in these areas and provide fertile grounds to spawn the next game-changing innovations in plant science that will make a ?green?-Green Revolution possible.<br/><br/>The 2022 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Salt and Water Stress in Plants will bring together researchers endeavoring to discover the mechanistic basis of stress tolerance in plants at different scales of organization.  The program represents an acknowledgement of the holistic nature of plant-environmental interactions and the need to integrate research topics that span molecular, cellular, developmental, ecological and global scales.  The program will focus on salinity and other water-associated stresses, and will now also include pioneering work that examines the interface between these stresses and the biotic realm.  Presentations will highlight the power of model systems, tackle evolutionary questions spanning species boundaries, and examine the nexus between basic and applied research using globally relevant crops.  Through this interdisciplinary forum, we hope to pool together researchers that are answering the most compelling scientific questions with the broadest impact.  The bulk of the GRC will comprise 20-minute presentations of unpublished research and 10-minute discussion periods. Although the core of the program is established, nearly half of the talks will be selected from submitted abstracts to air the most recent discoveries and provide opportunities for younger and rising trainees. The program includes poster sessions and free time to enhance idea exchange and networking. The GRS pre-meeting is organized by trainees and focused on multi-disciplinary research topics that explore plant diversity, genomics, integrative physiology and field-relevant research.  The conference will support broader participation through targeted travel awards to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows interested in pursuing plant research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This individualized care could result in limiting the patient?s exposure to radiation or could provide the patient with access to supplemental screening. Improving the screening process for women at a young age offers the chance of a better prognosis. In addition, early detection could allow for novel treatment options to target cancer-prone breast tissue, potentially leading to the prevention of the disease.  The software would be comparable and complementary to genetic testing for breast cancer risks.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a proposed computer-aided detection software and its potential to discriminate between healthy, organized, dense mammographic breast tissue versus unhealthy, disorganized, dense breast tissue often associated with the onset of a tumor. The subtle differences between healthy and unhealthy tissue are challenging to identify visually. This technology discriminates between healthy and unhealthy tissue to identify the sub-regions of mammographic breast tissue that are particularly ?risky?.  The technology may explain the effect breast density has on someone's increased risk for breast cancer. Computer-aided breast cancer detection software has been used for over two decades without signficant clinical improvement.

Participation in these spaces can help students to feel connected to the engineering profession and to build their engineering identity, which can impact recruitment, retention, and persistence. However, students may benefit unequally from participation in these spaces. In this study, a makerspace micro-credentialing program, where students earn digital badges as they master making skills such as digital design and 3D printing, will be explored as a strategy to promote student engagement in makerspaces. Digital badges make student competencies visible, both to students who earn the credential and to their peers and instructors, helping students gain recognition of their skills and helping them feel more secure in their identity as engineers. This study will explore how digital badging in makerspaces impacts identity development in engineering students, exploring the potential of makerspaces to act as a complementary pathway for students to become engineers. Additionally, new strategies to promote makerspace involvement resulting from this study will help engineering educators support the development of an innovative and broadly based engineering workforce. <br/><br/>This project will evaluate digital badging in makerspaces as a pedagogical strategy to support professional formation through the development of engineering identity and belongingness. This research seeks to answer two critical research questions: How do digital badges impact the development of students? sense of belonging in engineering and engineering identity?; and How do digital badges influence students? participation in makerspaces? To explore these questions, first-year students in an engineering design course will earn digital badges in a university makerspace. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative survey measures of students? engineering identity and sense of belonging and inductive coding of student interviews to identify themes in students? experience with the makerspace and digital badging activities. The study will provide: 1) Evaluation of the impact of digital badges on the types and frequency of activities students undertake in makerspaces; 2) Increased knowledge of student professional formation by exploring how credentialing in a makerspace supports student identity formation for all populations; 3) Exploration of how students? perceptions of badge relevance affect their engagement with badging activities and their resulting professional formation; and 4) Deeper understanding of engineering identity development in first-year engineering courses at a Hispanic-serving institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Software systems learn by using algorithms to recognize patterns and draw inferences from existing data and apply the inferences to previously unseen data. Deep Learning (DL) is a kind of machine-learning algorithm inspired by neural networks of human brains. A DL model learns decision logic from a large set of examples. A classic application is image processing, where a model may learn to recognize particular images through training with many sample images. While software systems that incorporate DL models involve large amounts of data, they still have to be efficient and responsive. This project is expected to increase DL system robustness, reliability, and scalability, positively impacting computer vision, autonomous driving, medicine, and extremism identification. Tools developed as a result of this project are also expected to democratize the Artificial Intelligence workforce, as they will assist data scientists and software engineers of varying proficiencies in writing quality DL code. Such tools can potentially contribute to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce and increase US economic competitiveness. This project will also promote software engineering concepts in machine learning by augmenting and creating several undergraduate and graduate courses. Dissemination will occur through publicly distributing datasets, papers, open-source software, and Open Educational Resources.<br/><br/>DL frameworks increasingly make various tradeoffs to balance the often competing requirements of reliability, usability, and generality. Popular DL frameworks have historically embraced graph-based, deferred execution-style (low-level) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). While efficient, (legacy) systems using such interfaces are cumbersome, error-prone, and difficult to debug, maintain, and port. Contrarily, (modern) eager execution-style DL APIs facilitate higher-level, imperative, and Object-Oriented (Python) programs that are easier to debug, less error-prone, and more extensible have consequently emerged at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim to bridge the two paradigms, they necessitate a non-trivial amount of technical metadata and exhibit several limitations and known issues on the use of native program constructs. This project is expected to contribute practical analyses and safe transformations for modern imperative and Object-Oriented DL programs that markedly improve their reliability and scalability. First, various software engineering artifacts will be mined for bug fixes, (manual) refactorings (semantics-preserving source-to-source program transformations), and missed opportunities in efficiently executing imperative DL code. Then, novel analyses and refactorings for automatically (i) migrating legacy, deferred execution-style DL code to more robust imperative DL code and (ii) specifying how their otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL code should be reliably and efficiently executed as graphs at run-time will be formulated. Finally, novel analyses for detecting performance bottlenecks and semantic errors associated with graph-based execution of imperative, otherwise eagerly-executed DL code will be designed. This contribution is significant because it fills the void of techniques, methodologies, and tools for effectively developing---and evolving long-lived---trustworthy and efficient DL systems that pervasively use imperative and Object-Oriented DL programming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established 50 years ago to ensure that all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn, and work. However, low-income communities of color continue to be disproportionately exposed to air and water pollution. Disparities in exposure to air and water pollution have led to scholarship on environmental justice principles, which asserts that communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations. Professional societies and national academies are actively involved in these discussions. For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers? (ASCE) statement on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion calls for building mutually beneficial partnerships with engineering and non-engineering organizations and advancing a research agenda centered on equitable and inclusive engineering education, research, and practice. An overarching challenge for environmental engineering is educational reform to ensure holistic solutions that build on authentic partnerships with community stakeholders, especially those whose agency has historically been limited in environmental decision making. The project team plans to collaborate on the development of curriculum that focuses on fair treatment and equitable involvement of communities in the planning and design of critical infrastructures.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop and implement a suite of integrated, interdisciplinary, community-engaged, anti-Black-racism training opportunities for civil and environmental engineering undergraduates to build capacity for addressing complex and interconnected challenges of our time. The new curricula for undergraduate civil and environmental engineering and anthropology training is intended to address anti-Black-racism as it relates to urban infrastructure while partnering with local entities to build equitable communities. African American communities in the Tampa Bay and San Francisco Bay regions will serve as the convergence space where academic educators/researchers, community members, and practitioners begin to create and implement innovative course materials in a set of five engineering courses that will help students achieve ABET accredited student learning outcomes. The project aims to include additional faculty at the two institutions who have expressed interest in participating in the project?s workshops that would impact additional engineering courses. Results from the proposed research will be disseminated through channels to reach diverse stakeholders at multiple universities through faculty workshops/seminars, community meetings, and an annual Institute on Black Life conference that focuses on community engaged partnership and scholarship. Project results will be shared with STEM educators at national conferences convened by societies such as the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, American Society of Engineering Education conference, and the American Educational Research Association.

This project aims to close this gap through foundational understanding of deep learning and designing algorithms to improve reliability and data efficiency.

The first thrust is to understand the algorithmic regularization effect of algorithms and architectures. Using these insights, the team will design better loss functions and architectures to improve accuracy. The second thrust is to theoretically compare the accuracy of networks trained with stochastic gradient descent against their architecture-induced kernel methods. This comparison may theoretically demonstrate that neural networks can do feature learning, which explains the empirical success of deep learning, and that kernel methods cannot. Finally, the project will study representation learning, and theoretically analyze how deep networks can transfer their representations between different domains.

The project will provide guidance and training for female and underrepresented minority undergraduate students through their participation in the project. Efficient down conversion will be acehived due to the excellent ability of perovskite nanoparticles to capture UV and X-ray photons, and transfer radiationlessly the energy of their exciton states to the embedded Ln ions that re-emit in visible and NIR. Strong scintillation induced by X-rays will be due to short stopping range of the X-ray photons resulting from combined action of lead and lanthanide ions.

Although methods to predict and prevent the segregation of mixtures of large and ?small? particles have been developed over the past decade, the segregation behavior changes dramatically when small particles are replaced by ?fine? particles, which are so small that they can easily fall between large particles even when the large particles are stationary. Avoiding de-mixing in chemical or pharmaceutical processing is essential for product quality (uniform distributions of ingredients in pharmaceutical tablets), reducing waste (segregated fine particles are often discarded), mitigating safety concerns (airborne fine particles are an explosion hazard), minimizing health risks (inhalation of fine particles), and preventing fouled equipment (fine particles coat surfaces of equipment and sensors). In geophysical flows, fine particles can increase landslide hazards by acting as friction-reducing ball bearings or becoming airborne (billowing clouds in rock avalanches). Currently, however, the physics of fine particle de-mixing is poorly understood. The goal of this award is to develop a fundamental understanding of how fine particles segregate using computer simulations, which could lead to an accurate and widely applicable model for such granular flows. <br/><br/>Discrete Element Method (DEM) computer simulations, validated with experiments, will be used to develop a fundamental understanding of fine particle flow and segregation. At the flow level, the size and spatial distributions of interstices between large particles through which fine particles transit will be characterized for a variety of flow conditions and particle size ratios leading to a relation for the dependence of the fine particle percolation velocity on the shear rate, particle size ratio, and species concentration. At the individual particle level, particle contact forces, ballistic interactions, and free sifting percolation kinematics will be characterized. The goal is to develop a predictive model for segregating fine particles much like the advection-diffusion-segregation continuum model that has been successfully implemented to predict the segregation of particles with small size ratios (less than 3). This award will transform the understanding, prediction, and control of the segregation and mixing of large and fine particles from ad hoc approaches to a physics-based model. It may also result in new insights into dry lubrication and geophysical flows where particle sizes vary by orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another famous classic example is that L. Rayleigh conjectured that the disk should minimize the fundamental frequency of a membrane among all shapes of equal area, more than a century ago. Other recent applications include mechanical vibration, design of optical resonator, photonic crystal waveguides, determination of favorable and unfavorable regions in population dynamics, soap films and minimal surfaces, drug design, and image segmentation. Numerical approaches for these kinds of problems require both forward solvers and optimization solvers. The forward solvers are numerical approaches to solve problems on a given setting of geometric parameters or domain. The optimization solvers aim to find the optimal geometric design, which maximizes the design objective.  <br/><br/>In this proposal, the aim is to study geometric optimization of p-Laplacian Poisson?s equations, Laplace Beltrami operator, Steklov problems, and their applications in optimal radiotherapy design and free boundary minimal surfaces. The forward solvers are based on finite element methods and methods of particular solutions while the optimization solvers are based on rearrangement methods, shape derivatives, and sensitivity analysis of conformal factor, conformal classes, and metrics. The PI will study a wide class of problems arising from many applications including (1) optimization of total displacement, (2) convergence rate study of rearrangement methods for optimization problems, (3) optimal radiotherapy design, (4) maximizing conformal and topological Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on closed Manifolds, and (5) extremal Steklov eigenvalue problems and free boundary minimal surfaces.

The proposed technology has the potential to produce more rapid protection, expand pathogen/variant coverage, and extend the longevity of protection afforded by influenza vaccination and other vaccines. This added protection will reduce the high healthcare costs and productivity losses due to mortality/morbidity.

While vaccines represent a major medical success, several diseases have proven difficult to address, including seasonal and pandemic influenza, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV. One way to improve the efficacy of vaccines for these diseases is to use an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response to the antigen presented via vaccination. The proposed technology has the potential to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of infections directly and via heterologous immunity because the addition of ?Stimulator of Interferon Genes? (STING) agonist overproduction to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) serves a dual purpose: it enhances the elevated trained immunity of macrophages already known to be conferred by BCG and promotes critical antiviral IFN-I responses.

Due to the growing computational power of edge devices, coupled with concerns over transmitting private data, it is increasingly attractive to store data locally and push network computation to the edge. Federated learning explores training machine learning models at the edge in distributed networks. While federated learning has shown tremendous promise for enabling edge applications, practical deployment is currently stymied by a number of competing constraints. In addition to being accurate, federated learning methods must scale to potentially massive networks of devices, and must exhibit trustworthy behavior---addressing pragmatic concerns related to issues such as user privacy, fairness, and robustness. In this project, we explore multi-task learning, a technique that learns separate but related models for each device in the network, as a unified approach to address the competing constraints of federated learning. The objective of the project is to develop scalable multi-task learning methods that are suitable for practical federated networks, and to rigorously study the foundational properties of federated multi-task learning in terms of the goals of accuracy, scalability, and trustworthiness. In doing so, the research will unlock a new generation of federated learning systems that can holistically address the constraints of realistic federated networks.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish and rigorously study the use of federated multi-task learning. While the accuracy benefits of federated multi-task learning are well-known, the work charts two new directions. First, the project develops methods to realize multi-task learning at scale in massive federated networks. Secondly, the project shows that multi-task learning, by improving privacy, fairness, and robustness, is in fact key for trustworthy federated learning. The technical aims of the project work are divided into three thrusts. First, by approximating standard notions of multi-task learning, the project will develop and rigorously study a family of highly scalable federated multi-task learning objectives. Second, the privacy implications of multi-task learning will be analyzed and evaluated in order to understand trade-offs between privacy and utility in federated networks. Finally, this project will explore tensions between fairness (in terms of performance disparities across devices) and robustness (to data and model poisoning attacks) in federated learning. Although these goals may be at odds, this project aims to show that multi-task learning can inherently improve both fairness and robustness, helping both to be achieved jointly. Taken together, this work has the potential to cause a paradigm-shift in the way federated learning systems are designed, implemented, and analyzed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such biases, if left unattended, can cause or exacerbate unfair distribution of resources, social division, spatial disparity, and weaknesses in resilience or sustainability. Spatial fairness is urgently needed for the use of artificial intelligence in a large variety of real-world problems such as agricultural monitoring and disaster management. Agricultural products, including crop maps and acreage estimates, are used to inform important decisions such as the distribution of subsidies and providing farm insurance. Inaccuracies and inequities produced by spatial biases adversely affect these decisions. Similarly, effective and fair mapping of natural disasters such as floods or fires is critical to inform live-saving actions and quantify damages and risks to public infrastructures, which is related to insurance estimation. Machine learning, in particular deep learning, has been widely adopted for spatial datasets with promising results.  However, straightforward applications of machine learning have found limited success in preserving spatial fairness due to the variation of data distribution, data quantity, and data quality. The goal of this project is to develop a new generation of learning frameworks to explicitly preserve spatial fairness. The results and code will be made freely available and integrated into existing geospatial software. The methods will also be tested for incorporation in existing real systems (crop and water monitoring). <br/><br/>This project aims to advance deep learning methods toward spatial fairness via four innovations. First, new statistical formulations of spatial fairness will be investigated to address unique challenges brought by the continuous spatial domain, particularly due to a variety of ways to partition the space and create location-groups for fairness evaluation, and the fact that statistical conclusions are sensitive to changes in space-partitionings. Second, new network architectures will be developed to improve the spatial fairness by mitigating the conflicts amongst different locations due to the shift of data distribution over space. Third, new fairness-driven adversarial learning strategies will be used to guide the training to converge to parameters that can maintain a high overall solution quality while maximizing spatial fairness across locations. Finally, a knowledge-enhanced approach will be proposed, which integrates general physical relationships to mitigate data-inequality incurred spatial biases, and simulates relevant variables and parameters in underlying physical processes to enhance knowledge-based interpretability of spatial fairness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But as semiconductor technology now faces fundamental physical limits, even while large-scale systems are reaching warehouse scales, new approaches are becoming essential to achieving efficient use of computing resources. In particular, given this divergence of scales, HPC systems have necessarily become more distributed and  asynchronous (in the sense that system clocks are asynchronous), resulting in increasingly variable and unpredictable execution. While these effects are recognized as critical hindrances to HPC performance, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. What is known, however, is that much HPC infrastructure is tasked with dealing with inefficiency derived from asynchrony, variability, and unpredictability, leading to a deep and complex hardware/software support stack. The project team's hypothesis is that while each stack element provides a local solution, it may also exacerbate the global problem: that complexity has resulted in more variability, not less, and made determining its causes more difficult. This project explores the possibility of reversing the trend of ever-increasing complexity by removing and simplifying support layers. This strategy?s achievable gains remain limited, however, while the underlying cause, execution asynchrony, remains unaddressed. The approach begins by leveraging recently developed technology that enables clocks to remain extremely accurate even when distributed on a planetary scale. Such accurate, distributed clocks serve to underpin a virtuous cycle where synchrony establishes baseline predictability, which, in turn, reduces variability, and at each stage of the cycle enables reduction in the complexity of the support stack. A benefit of this approach is that the individual steps are largely simple and can be applied directly to existing software systems. <br/><br/>This one-year project aims to obtain early findings and practical demonstrations for the importance of synchrony and predictability to increase HPC compute efficiency and thereby improve large-scale program execution. Five tasks are conducted. The first is to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate clock distribution by augmenting existing HPC network infrastructure. The second is to demonstrate the application of synchrony in the establishing a virtuous cycle enabling  simplifications to the software/system support stack. The third is to devise mechanisms to model, measure, and validate systems using the proposed methods. The fourth is to investigate the relative benefits of applying the synchrony-based virtuous cycle with respect to various application classes. The fifth is to demonstrate the overall efficacy of the proposed approach through a case study involving a production application. Overall, the project works to  determine whether added synchronization through accurate clocks enables significant improvements to HPC computations in terms of how efficiently they use computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located near Geneva, Switzerland is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, able to reach the highest particle energies in a laboratory setting. The CMS detector at the LHC is one of the world's most powerful and sophisticated cameras, observing the collisions of protons and recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces, or even glimpses of new fundamental particles. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations. <br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several physics searches with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. They are also incorporating ideas like high-speed pattern recognition, deep multivariate neural networks, self-guided machine learning, and image recognition into the search for new physics at the deepest levels. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including leading major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector hardware and operations in the areas of tracking, calorimetry and luminosity measurement. They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas, leading to a rich program of physics analyses that has originated from their efforts. This award also allows the Rutgers group to continue deploying an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as testing and installation of the front-end electronics for the forward hadron calorimeter. They are also working on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger, introducing innovative ideas that promise to increase the reach for new physics to regions not previously capable of being probed by any collider. They are in the process of establishing a production and testing facility for the upgrades. <br/><br/>Through the Rutgers QuarkNet program, the group runs summer workshops for high-school teachers and students from across New Jersey, analyzing LHC data and building cosmic-ray telescopes. They also mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students. These students work closely with the group and contribute to ongoing studies and physics analyses. To address the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women. They have developed a highly successful intensive instructional program for high school physics teachers in AP-level physics which has led to improved student understanding of physics, and a marked increase in perfect scores on the AP-physics exam. The Rutgers group continues to convey the excitement of particle physics with frequent talks at local high schools, libraries, and other venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Martin St. Maurice from Marquette University, Lawrence Wackett from University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and Betsy Martinez-Vaz from Hamline University are studying the enzymes and metabolic pathways that microbes use to degrade guanide and biguanide compounds that are commonly found in fertilizers, fuel propellants and pharmaceuticals. The most notable example is the biguanide drug metformin, which represents the fourth most prescribed pharmaceutical on the planet. Metformin is entering wastewater treatment plants at an alarming rate, with no clear sense of how it is being degraded by microorganisms. Using detailed studies of enzyme structure/function, chemical biology, comparative genomics and microbiology, this project aims to identify the metabolic pathway(s) and characterize the bacterial enzymes responsible for biodegrading metformin and related guanide and biguanide compounds. This project is expected to provide useful data to assist scientists and engineers in the development of better bioremediation practices in municipal water treatment plants where metformin is a major entering chemical. Further, this project integrates teaching, mentorship and training across three universities by incorporating the proposed research directly into graduate training, multi-institutional undergraduate courses, career mentorship and summer internships, significantly broadening the impact of the project.<br/><br/>This project seeks to generate a comprehensive description of the metabolic pathways that are available naturally for the degradation of guanidinium compounds by microbial species and their relevant enzymes in wastewater and also in the human gut environment. The central metabolic artery includes the combined activities of guanylurea hydrolase, guanidine carboxylase, carboxyguanidine deiminase and allophanate hydrolase. The molecular contributions to the substrate selectivity of guanidine carboxylase will be characterized by x-ray crystallography and enzyme kinetic analysis. The structure and function of the carboxyguanidine deiminase enzyme will be examined by investigating the mechanism of catalysis, the functional role of the subunits and the potential for substrate channeling. The pathway and enzyme(s) responsible for bacterial metformin degradation will be identified by a combination of enzyme isolation, purification, and comparative genomics, across potentially relevant bacterial species,  followed by detailed structural and functional characterization of the metformin-degrading enzyme(s). This project is expected to provide new information on how biguanide compounds are funneled into biodegradation pathways, providing a gateway to better understanding of how one important class of nitrogen-rich man-made compounds, produced across a variety of industrial sectors, is environmentally degraded.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconducting polymers are organic macromolecules in which a backbone of alternating single and multiple bonds results in pi-conjugation.  This enables overlapping of molecular orbitals, which in turn allows for the delocalization of electrons.  Following the doping process, the delocalized electrons become free to move around, resulting in an electrical current as they pass along the conjugated polymer backbone.  Currently, conjugated polymers are the most important class of plastics used for optoelectronic devices such as LED screens in mobile devices and computers, solar cells, energy storage, sensors, and many others.  However, many of the conjugated systems that meet performance metrics for these applications have complex structures, require multiple synthetic steps and generate toxic waste during polymerization protocols.  This work addresses these issues and will focus on the synthesis of conjugated monomers in fewer synthetic steps from commercially available aldehydes, anilines and other biobased starting materials.  Furthermore, the synthesis will be performed in the air and will not require extensive purification.  The polymerization will also bypass commonly required cryogenic air- and water-free conditions.  Beyond fundamental insights into the influence of monomer design on the polymer properties, degradable/recyclable copolymers also will be prepared.  The advances in the synthesis of conjugated polymers that will be enabled by this research broadly support energy security by lessening demand on fossil fuel resources and employing less energy-intensive processing methods.  This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with training in polymer synthesis and macromolecular characterization techniques. Laboratory research will be complimented by efforts to develop upper division organic/polymer curriculum that will enable students to become familiar with fundamental concepts of macromolecular science, academic research, and how these are connected to societal problems.  Synergistic research and education initiatives will provide opportunities for under-represented groups, especially African Americans, women, and first-generation students from rural North Georgia.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the development of modular, simple, and efficient synthesis of electron-rich pyrrolopyrroles for novel and tailorable conjugated polymers.  In the first thrust, dihalogenated pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles (H2DPP) will be prepared and incorporated into the main chain of conjugated polymers using direct heteroarylation polymerization.  A strong focus will be placed on fundamental design and structure-property relationships such as optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties.  The second thrust will center on the synthesis of degradable and recyclable H2DPP-based conjugated copolymers.  This will be achieved by acid-catalyzed step-growth copolymerization of dialdehyde H2DPP with various diamines.  Such strategy will eliminate the need for transition metal catalysts. More importantly, the resulting azomethine functional groups in the polymer backbone can readily be degraded by acid to their respective monomers.  Outcomes from this work have the potential to provide fundamental information regarding new monomeric building blocks, develop simple polymers for sustainable approaches in organic electronics, and demonstrate the viability of H2DPPs in redox-active applications.  The designed processes have high atom economy, are energy efficient and more environmentally benign than currently utilized methodologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current version of CREP supports students with undergraduate research training through replicating published experiments.  In this model, CREP selects recent psychological studies that could be replicated independently by students, and then organizes and helps instructors who want to supervise these projects as part of their courses. This project expands on the current CREP model by engaging selected students from across the United States in twice-monthly cohort meetings where they can present their work, as well as have opportunity to serve as peer mentors for future cohorts of students. Another goal of the project is to evaluate CREP as a tool for improving research skills, research literacy, critical thinking about psychology, and to provide a range of students with research experience. This project could impact psychology and other STEM disciplines by providing instructors with a model for involving students in authentic research within the context of their coursework. <br/><br/>This project aims to evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of an enhanced CREP model for undergraduate student research projects. The standard CREP project, outlined in Wagge and colleagues (2019), supports students and their instructors in the completion of direct replication projects as part of the undergraduate curriculum. In this project, the CREP team selects studies for students to choose from, and student teams complete replications of these studies at different institutions around the world. They interface with the CREP team when the projects are reviewed by CREP both before and after data collection, and potentially again in the future when a pooled or meta-analysis is written based on data collected from all teams. The project expands on the CREP model by adding -- for selected students in the United States -- twice-monthly cohort meetings with other teams under the supervision of a Graduate Assistant, CREP Executive Director, and/or peer mentors who completed projects the previous year. Participants will be recruited for the study through their instructors, who will be recruited from Listservs and social media to sign up to be randomly assigned to either a CREP or standard (non-CREP) research project class. Instructors will give students information about how to sign up to participate in the study. Pretests and posttests will be conducted online through Avila's system using survey software.

In phosphorus-limited surface water systems, eutrophication has been shown to cause a decrease in water quality, oxygen depletion, a loss of aquatic biota, and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Frequent HABs have an adverse impact in communities that rely on surface water bodies for drinking water, fishing, recreational activities, and tourism. The overarching goal of this ERI project is to investigate the role and impact of recalcitrant organic phosphorus species on the occurrence of HABs in surface water systems. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator of this ERI project proposes to focus on inositol phosphate (IP) as an important and representative form of recalcitrant organic phosphorus, and its impact on the occurrence of HABS. Two key objectives of the proposed research are to 1) quantify the formation of soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) from IP in surface water systems and 2) assess how reactive orthophosphate species generated from the dephosphorylation of IP initiate and sustain HABs. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the development of new fundamental knowledge that could guide the control and mitigation of HABs. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students at Georgia Southern University.<br/><br/>The role of inorganic phosphorus on the occurrence, frequency, and intensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in surface water systems is well understood. The role and impact of organic phosphorus on HABs have also been established.  However, a fundamental understanding and quantification of the bioavailability of organic phosphorus (Po) and its role in promoting and sustaining HABs remains elusive. This ERI project will address these critical knowledge gaps. More specifically, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to focus on the evaluation and quantification of the contribution of inositol phosphate (IP), an important and representative recalcitrant Po, to the total pool of orthophosphate (OP) and other soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) species that fuels and sustain HABs. The specific objectives of the research are to: 1) Quantify the amount of Po produced from the microbial mineralization of IP in surface water systems; 2) Assess the nutritive potential of IP through evaluations of the relationships between IP biodegradability and its role in initiating and sustaining HABs via measurements of the rates of phosphorus acquisition by algae; and 3) Uncover the physical-chemical properties of the environmental media (i.e., OP and total phosphorus (TP) ratios, pH, redox potential, and IP mobility) in which IP is preferentially mineralized. The successful completion of this project has potential for transformative impact through the generation of new knowledge and data to advance the fundamental understanding of the role and impact of IP on the occurrence and persistence of HABs in surface water systems. To implement the education and outreach goals of this ERI project, the PI will develop an outreach program for stakeholders involved in nutrient management to discuss the role of organic phosphorous on eutrophication with the goal of improving P control strategies to prevent HABs. In addition, the PI plans to integrate the research findings into the Environmental Engineering undergraduate/graduate courses that he is currently teaching at Georgia Southern University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This detection opened a window into the ""dark side"" of the universe, providing the means to observe astrophysical objects and events that would otherwise be impossible to see with standard optical telescopes. To date, approximately 100 ""loud"" events, from relatively nearby black holes and/or neutron stars, have been detected by several large-scale gravitational-wave detectors including NSF's LIGO. But the combined signal from the population of more distant pairs of black holes has yet to be detected. This project is designed precisely to target this signal, which (using the analogy of hearing) would sound like popcorn popping. In other words, the signal consists of weak bursts of gravitational waves of short duration (~seconds) separated by periods (~a few minutes) of relative silence. The data analysis tools developed as part of this project will explicitly take into account the popcorn-like nature of the signal, leading to a more sensitive search and a possible first detection of this type of signal within the next few years. The project will provide support and training in data analysis to one or two graduate students, thus adding to the growing community of researchers in this emerging field. The computational and data analysis skills that the students will acquire are transferable outside the field of gravitational-wave astronomy, making the students marketable in a variety of disciplines--potentially as future university professors or outside the university setting in research labs or high-tech companies.<br/><br/>The proposed project consists of three main activities, which increase in scope and complexity over the period of the proposal: (i) First, to provide a ""proof-of-principle"" demonstration of a stochastic-signal-based search for popcorn-like (intermittent) gravitational-wave signals in the context of a set of relatively simple toy models. (ii) Second, to extend the data analysis pipeline developed in part (i) to run on more realistic data sets, thus stress-testing the proposed search. (iii) Third, to run a production version of the pipeline developed in part (ii) on the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data taken during the 4th observation run O4, which will start near the end of 2022 / beginning of 2023. The proposed stochastic-signal-based search has the potential to advance the field of gravitational-wave astronomy by being the first search to detect the signal from mergers of pairs of stellar-mass black holes throughout the Universe. This is possible because the search takes into account the intermittent nature of the signal, which should lead to a reduced time-to-detection by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the recovered signal amplitude compared to the current search, which assumes that the signal is ""on"" all the time. In addition, by using a stochastic-signal model, the search is both more robust to the type of source and less computationally demanding than a deterministic-signal-based search, which is tuned to the specific waveforms associated with binary black hole mergers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Creativity is the cornerstone and the fundamental motive of both the aesthetic and engineering disciplines. It is a critical element of our economic and social prosperity, as a precursor to scientific discoveries, technological advances, and new forms of cultural and aesthetic experiences. Held every other year in an international location since 1993, C&C serves as a gathering place for the diverse communities of researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on creativity and cognition as well as technological innovation. C&C is the only ACM-sponsored conference in which human creativity is the central focus, and as such it provides pathways for substantially different kinds of work including interactive art pieces, user studies of creativity support tools, and new sensor technologies for creative practice. It serves as a premier forum for presenting the world's best new research investigating computing's impact on and ability to promote creativity in all forms of human experience. The conference particularly values research that explores new, synergistic roles for computing and people in creative processes, or that addresses situations where computing, as contextualized in sociotechnical systems, may sometimes have an undesirable impact.  The theme of this year's conference is ""Creativity, Craft, and Design"" and more information may be found online at http://cc.acm.org/2022/.  The Graduate Student Symposium will have broad impact by contributing to the professional development of a more knowledgeable, capable, and productive workforce in the U.S., and by inviting participation of graduate students along with promising senior-level undergraduates from under-represented groups and at institutions not historically represented at the conference through aggressive and targeted recruitment. To further promote diversity, no more than two graduate students will be accepted from any one educational institution, and if there are two then at least one of them must be female.<br/><br/>The Graduate Student Symposium will bring together up to 12 students (not all of whom will be eligible for funding) and 3 distinguished researchers from academia and industry as mentors, in a day-long event that will be held on June 20, 2022, the day before the main C&C conference.  It will provide the students with a unique opportunity to present early-stage research and receive gentle feedback from mentors with different disciplinary backgrounds.  The young researchers will gain experience and skills in communicating their own work and critiquing the work of their peers, as well as professional and social connections that transcend the event, and awareness of potential career paths in both academia and industry.

This research will reveal vulnerable characteristics in regional housing construction markets and identify effective disaster-related policies to alleviate these vulnerabilities. It will help identify the construction capacity gaps that cause the construction cost escalation following natural disasters. The discovery is critical for raising awareness, developing a greater construction capacity, setting effective reconstruction goals, initiating risk mitigation and resourcing strategies, and enforcing effective regulations and policies. Cutting the housing recovery time and cost through effective pre-planning could be realized. This project also aims to address the critical shortage of talents capable of leading post-disaster reconstruction in the civil engineering discipline. Hispanics and women graduate and undergraduate students at the Hispanic-serving University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will participate in every step of this project. This project will enable students to work with city planners to lead stakeholder involvement in disadvantaged communities.<br/><br/>This project will address fundamental limitations of existing demand surge models by 1) creating non-hazard econometric baselines for housing construction cost variations, 2) creating an econometric measurement method for quantifying post-disaster construction cost escalations, 3) creating spatiotemporal econometric models to represent the housing reconstruction demand surge, and assessing the housing reconstruction vulnerability of communities, and 4) quantifying the impacts of disaster-related policies on housing reconstruction. This project will generate new knowledge at the nexus of three critical disciplines: Housing Construction, Economics, and Built Environment Resilience. The research will transform existing construction demand surge models by establishing links between pre-disaster construction market conditions and post-disaster construction cost escalations. To that end, spatiotemporal econometric models, such as spatial panel data models, will use data from more than 600 U.S. counties affected by large-scale natural disasters over the past ten years, as well as data from their neighboring counties. These models will consider different circumstances based on a range of non-hazard to extreme hazard conditions. Difference-in-difference panel data models will estimate the effect of disaster-related policies (ranging from local to federal).

However, the increasing reliance of PCSs on digital communications and networking technologies, together with the growth in complexity and sophistication of cyberattack techniques, have rendered industrial PCSs vulnerable to cyberattacks by malicious agents. Cyberattacks on PCSs aim to disrupt process operations, potentially resulting in adverse effects on public safety and prosperity. The traditional approach for improving cybersecurity of PCSs involves fortifying information technology (IT) systems to prevent a cyberattacker or malicious software from gaining access to the PCS network. However, IT-based cybersecurity approaches remain vulnerable, motivating methods that account for the threat of cyberattacks directly in the PCS design and operation. In this project, computational and modeling tools will be developed to design PCS-based detection methods capable of sensing the presence of cyberattacks in industrially relevant processes to enhance the resiliency and cybersecurity of PCSs. The project findings will provide fundamental insights into which cyberattacks can be detected and how detection sensitivity is linked to PCS performance. Undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be recruited to carry out the research activities, those which include simulated cyberattacks on large-scale industrial processes. Overall, the transformative impact of this project is in its creation of a cybersecurity framework that is directly integrated into PCS design considerations and subsequent operation, driving a paradigm shift in PCS cybersecurity away from treating cyberthreats to PCSs exclusively as an IT-specific problem.<br/><br/>The increasing reliance of chemical manufacturing Process Control Systems (PCSs) on advanced communications and networking technologies and the growing sophistication of cyberattacks have rendered industrial PCSs vulnerable to attacks by malicious agents. Cyberattacks on PCSs aim to disrupt operations, destabilize processes, or cause safety incidents. Traditionally, PCS cybersecurity has been based on fortifying Information Technology (IT) systems to prevent a cyberattacker or malicious software from gaining access to the PCS network. While improving IT security will prevent some cyberattacks on PCSs, an attacker may circumvent the IT security measures over extended periods of time without the knowledge of the process operators. This fundamental limitation of IT-based cybersecurity motivates a control-based approach. In this project, active control-enabled cyberattack detection methods will be developed to signal external attacks that manipulate data communicated over the sensor-controller and controller-actuator links. The methods will incorporate cyberattack detection considerations directly in the PCS design and operation. The main research objectives of the project include a) identifying the fundamental properties of cyberattack detectability, including conditions for cyberattack detectability verification, and elucidating the role of the PCS design in cyberattack detectability, b) formulating a PCS design optimization problem that ensures detectability of cyberattacks, c) developing active cyberattack design methodologies to probe/manipulate the PCS to detect stealthy cyberattacks, and d) applying the detection methods to simulated benchmark chemical processes to demonstrate and analyze the performance of this new approach to cybersecurity. The project is expected to advance the fundamental understanding of cyberattack detectability and develop novel control-enabled software tools for cyberattack detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the mathematical tools employed in modern signal processing, Fourier analysis stands as one of the key players. In particular, the methods developed in Fourier analysis are instrumental in decomposing complex signals into their elementary building blocks. This project aims to push the current understanding of several modern tools related to Fourier analysis in applications such as data science, signal processing, and quantum information theory beyond their current frontiers. Moreover, this project's educational component will allow the investigators to continue training students in the underlying mathematics fields it covers. The investigators will also integrate the outcomes of this research program into graduate and advanced undergraduate courses offered at their respective institutions. <br/><br/>The project aims to solve some fundamental and unresolved problems in time-frequency analysis, especially the Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala (HRT) conjecture (which asserts that every finite collection of time-frequency shifts of a square-integrable function must be linearly independent) and several other related unresolved problems. These problems arise in time-frequency analysis and are at the intersection of many areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, and even engineering. The investigators will attack these problems from a multi-field approach, bringing to bear techniques from abstract, applied computational harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, Lie group, Lie algebra, complex, functional, and real analysis. This research will build on recent successes of applied and pure harmonic analysis, which include the wavelet-based JPEG standard, advances in phaseless reconstruction, and the fundamental role played by Gabor (or Weyl-Heisenberg) systems in the detection of the gravitational waves. A standard paradigm in many of these applications consists of decomposing arbitrary signals into redundant elementary building blocks. While the redundancy of these systems might seem counterintuitive for their use, it is nonetheless responsible for the robustness of certain algorithms for data transmission using unreliable channels. It will play a vital role in noise reduction algorithms. Wavelets and Gabor systems are examples of redundant systems, and such systems can represent many natural signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research assesses the responses of hunter-gatherer groups to the first introduction of farmers and their products. This is not only significant to understanding the nature of these interactions, but also for reconstructing watershed moments of change for modern descendant populations. Outputs from this project will be used to develop new interpretive materials for heritage organizations at the state and federal levels, especially the National Park Service. Additionally, the researchers will provide training on basic animal identification and analyses at the State Historical Society of North Dakota to the public and Indigenous community members. These outputs will increase scientific literacy and engagement. This research involves the formulation of a collaboration plan with members of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, with planned lectures and/or curriculum development for tribal schools.  As such, a broader impact will be increased partnership between academia, public heritage organizations, and Indigenous nations.<br/><br/>This research investigates the nature of contact between hunter-gatherers and farmers on the North American Great Plains using isotopic and ancient DNA analysis of dog remains from 17 previously excavated sites spanning from BC 6450 to AD 1880.  It will do so by tracking the use of maize by communities, before, during, and after the first introduction of farming by using dog diet as a proxy for maize presence. Ancient DNA analyses will differentiate dogs from wolves and coyotes, and stable isotope analyses will determine the degree of maize in the dogs? diets. Dogs are found in almost all archaeological assemblages on the northern Plains and consumed food and waste produced by their owners just as they do today. These datasets, when used in concert with archaeological data, will help illustrate the nature of forager-farmer interactions, mainly rejection, economic exchange, adoption. Specifically, this research addresses how and when these relationships originally formed, and how they changed over time. This project uses the Canine Surrogacy Approach as a new tool for identifying these interactions. Although dogs were crucial to the livelihoods of many different historic North American Indigenous groups, ancient DNA research of dogs from the Great Plains is limited. Ancient DNA, while used primarily in this research to identify dog remains from wild coyotes and wolves, will also contribute to the greater understanding of the variability of dogs in the Americas and potentially shed light on the timing of breeding with non-indigenous breeds from Europe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pollen vegetative cells carry the sperm cells inside them on their journey first through the air and then through the female reproductive structure to fuse with eggs and make seeds. During this process, the pollen vegetative cells use a large number of genes to grow and develop and to protect their cargo of sperm cells. Robust pollen that can survive adverse environmental conditions is essential for high yield in crops like corn (maize). Especially in regard to heat tolerance, pollen is an important consideration in crop improvement. Recent discoveries have revealed that enzymes called DNA glycosylases, which change the structure of DNA, are important for activating genes in pollen vegetative cells. This project aims to investigate the function of these enzymes in corn pollen. The results will yield new knowledge about pollen genetics and new tools for putting that knowledge to use in plant reproduction.<br/><br/>DNA methylation generally represses repetitive DNA. In certain situations, however, DNA methylation can regulate developmental gene expression. In plants, DNA glycosylases remove methylation and can mediate epigenetic inheritance. The goal of this project is to identify both genes and intergenic regions of the genome that are targeted for demethylation and to determine the functional significance of demethylation in pollen. This will involve a novel approach to determine the effects of demethylation on gene expression at single-cell resolution in mixed populations of normal and glycosylase-defective pollen. The capstone of the project will be testing the potential of engineering glycosylases to demethylate specific genetic elements. This will be an initial step toward a larger goal of creating experimental resources for studying the consequences of methylation as well as for epigenetically controlling gene expression in pollen, with potential for heritability into the next generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. How organisms develop is regulated through the interactions of genes and environmental conditions like nutrition. Gene regulation (turning genes ?on? or ?off?) therefore is an important point of control for many aspects of development, such as growth. Further, when gene regulation is modified by evolution, it can lead to the emergence of new traits. Yet, exactly how gene regulation is controlled is not fully understood. The fellow will research horned beetles, which are well known for their diverse forms of environment-dependent development, in order to understand how environment affects gene regulation to promote diversity. The fellow will also perform K-12 outreach and education. <br/><br/>Nutrition-responsive and male/female dimorphic traits are among the fastest evolving phenotype classes, yet the contribution of cis-regulatory elements like enhancers and promoters in facilitating or hindering such diversification is still relatively unexplored. This research seeks to better understand the interplay between molecular and environmental factors in the development and evolution of beetle head horns, behaviorally and ecologically significant structures. Horn formation is restricted to males in most species, and may be further elaborated as alternative horned or hornless male morphs depending on larval nutrition. In other species, such nutrition-responsive development has been lost or even reversed such that females now grow elaborate head horns. The fellow will 1) characterize the roles of chromatin accessibility and regulatory element sequence in regulation of beetle horn development within species; 2) perturb horn gene network function to gain mechanistic insight into the epigenetic architecture underlying horn formation; and 3) analyze how regulatory elements have evolved to drive diversification of beetle horn shape and size across species. Collectively, this proposal will provide fundamental insight into the role of cis-regulatory elements in the evolutionary development of traits across multiple axes of biological diversification of relevance across the tree of life. This research will be directly integrated with two broader impact efforts including creating high school summer research opportunities in bioinformatics at Indiana University and developing educational resources on genomics for K-12 schools in south-central Indiana.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MNPs have been found virtually in all ecosystems and environmental media. They can be easily ingested by living organisms and pose new risks to human and ecosystem health as they enter the food chain. Every year millions of tons of MNPs are released into oceans and seas. Recently, plastic particles were detected in air samples from marine atmosphere boundary layers. However, little is known about the processes and mechanisms that control the release and transfer of MNPs from oceans and seas to the atmosphere and other environmental compartments and media. This CAREER project will address these critical knowledge gaps. More specifically, the Principal Investigator proposes to carry out an integrated experimental and modeling project to test the hypotheses that 1) MNPs can be aerosolized and transferred to the atmosphere by sea spray through ocean/sea wave breaking and bubble bursting, 2) the aerosolization of MNP particles via sea spray is modulated by their size, shape, age, and composition, and 3) sea spray MNPs can be transferred to other environmental compartments and media through long-range atmospheric transport and deposition. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new data and knowledge to advance the fundamental understanding and quantification of the atmospheric release, transport, and deposition of sea spray MNPs in the environment. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate students at Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>A widely held assumption is that oceans and seas act as quasi-permanent sinks for micro-nanoplastics (MNPs); that is plastic particles which enter oceans and seas will remain there for extended periods. However, the detection of MNPs in air samples from marine atmosphere boundary layers suggests that particle transfer from oceans and seas to the atmosphere might be an important and yet poorly accounted pathway for plastic environmental transport and pollution. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to investigate and quantify the aerosolization of MNPs via sea spray and their atmospheric transport, deposition, and accumulation in the environment. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to carry out an integrated experimental and modeling program organized around four research tasks. Task 1 will investigate the generation of sea spray MNPs in a specially designed aerosol generator tank to simulate particle formation via ocean/sea wave breaking and bubble bursting using well characterized plastic particles as model systems. Task 2 will evaluate and quantify the relationships between the ?ux of aerosolized MNPs and particle size, shape, age, and composition. Task 3 will combine the data generated in Tasks 1 and 2 to develop and parameterize a process model that could be used to estimate the surface flux of sea spray MNP aerosols. Task 4 will integrate the MNP surface flux model from Task 3 into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to simulate and quantify the transport and deposition of sea spray MNP aerosols in relevant environmental compartments and media. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge, data, and modeling tools to quantify the generation of sea spray MNP aerosols and their subsequent transport, deposition, and accumulation in the environment. To implement the education and training goals of this CAREER project, the PI will work with the Science Museum of Western Virginia to create a public exhibit with hand-on experiments to demonstrate the formation of sea spray aerosols and marine atmospheric MNPs using an exhibit version of the PI?s aerosol generation tank. In addition, the PI plans to partner with the Center for Enhancement of Engineering Diversity (CEED) at Virgina Tech to develop a training module for summer camps for pre-college students who are underrepresented in STEM. The proposed summer camp module will include a hands-on experiment during which the students will learn how to characterize aerosolized MNPs from the PI?s lab using optical microscopy and related  image processing techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Frequently, high energy light and particles are rapidly generated by these systems through a process known as magnetic reconnection. An improved understanding of magnetic reconnection and the radiation it generates will be developed by this project using computer simulations and by including more realistic conditions motivated by astrophysical observations. The simulations will be used to connect the conditions of the plasma to the characteristics of the radiation. The research effort will improve our understanding  of how astrophysical plasmas behave and what are the sources of high energy radiation from our galaxy and beyond.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The fundamental plasma process of magnetic reconnection will be studied in the relativistic and asymmetric limit, in regimes where the magnetic energy per particle is larger than the rest mass energy and the plasma properties of the interacting magnetic structures differ from each other. The project will attempt to achieve three key goals: (1) develop scaling predictions for relativistic, asymmetric magnetic reconnection; (2) identify relationships between the initial asymmetric plasma parameters and the energetic, non-thermal particle distributions generated by reconnection; and (3) explore the contribution of magnetic reconnection to the non-thermal particle distribution in a global astrophysical system. The first two goals will be approached by performing a survey of plasma simulations of magnetic reconnection, which will be analyzed and compared with derived theoretical predictions. The third goal will be achieved by examining relativistic jet simulations of active galactic nuclei to estimate the reconnection-generated non-thermal spectrum of energetic particles. The parameter regimes to be explored, along with the application to relativistic jets is directly relevant to the growing field of plasma astrophysics and can provide insight into the origin of accelerated high energy particles and the associated impulsive emission in astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These chemical oxidants can also react with organic contaminants and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to generate byproducts which can adversely impact human health due to their potential toxicity. Currently, hundreds of byproducts have been detected in treated drinking water. However, only a limited number of these byproducts have been evaluated for toxicity as the current protocols used to assess their toxicity rely on a slow and inefficient chemical-by-chemical evaluation approach. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to develop a novel approach to identify toxic byproducts and their precursors in drinking water treated with chemical oxidants. This novel approach, reactivity-directed analysis (RDA), builds upon techniques and protocols pioneered in drug development and chemical risk assessment to identify all byproducts with simar mechanisms of toxicity in a sample of drinking water treated with chemical oxidants. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to understand, control, and mitigate the formation of toxic byproducts and their precursors in drinking water treated with chemical oxidants. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. <br/><br/>Chemical oxidants used in water treatment react with organic contaminants and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drinking water sources to generate a large variety of byproducts. However, a comprehensive assessment of the toxicity of drinking water byproducts has remained elusive. This CAREER project will address this critical knowledge gap. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to develop and apply a novel approach to detect toxic byproducts, called reactivity-directed analysis (RDA). This innovative approach leverages assays and protocols pioneered in drug development and chemical risk assessment to identify toxic organic electrophiles (the largest class of known toxicants) in treated drinking water and elucidate their precursors. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) Develop a novel microbead-based RDA assay for the detection of organic electrophiles in complex aqueous matrices, 2) Investigate the formation and reaction mechanisms of organic electrophiles produced from the reaction of phenolic DOM model compounds with chemical oxidants, and 3) Investigate the formation of organic electrophiles produced from the reactions of DOM isolates, treated wastewater, and surface water with chemical oxidants. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of fundamental knowledge to advance the development and implementation of a new framework for identifying toxic byproducts and their precursors that could be used to minimize and mitigate their formations in drinking water treatment systems. To implement the educational and training goals of this CAREER project, the PI will leverage his ongoing collaboration with The Food Project (TFP) to develop and implement an afterschool program (EnviroSense) that will expose middle and high-school students to the design and applications of water quality sensors. In addition, the PI plans to develop two new courses including an undergraduate lab course on water quality sensors and a graduate course on water quality assessment and monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Dean Mobbs at California Institute of Technology, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the mechanisms of human safety decisions. Every day humans engage in complex decision processes that promote survival by acquiring protection. Protection acquisition varies from simple decisions such as taking vitamins to ward off illness, to more complex behaviors such as building and training armies to defend against future threats. Despite observing numerous and diverse examples of safety decisions across individuals, scientists have not identified the cognitive and neural systems that promote protection acquisition. It is important to understand how humans achieve the goal of protecting ourselves because acquiring protection allows us to maintain safety and spend resources to engage in other important pursuits like creativity and cooperation. The purpose of this research is to contribute to a unified model of how the brain supports adaptive safety decisions. Additionally, a better understanding of how humans achieve safety has the potential to improve treatments for psychological disorders, including anxiety, which is characterized by an inability to recognize safety. <br/><br/>This proposal will make important basic science contributions to theories of decision making and will inform future efforts to promote healthy decision making in the face of threat. This proposal will examine the computational decision control systems that support adaptive safety acquisition, reward acquisition, and threat avoidance. This work will achieve three main aims (1) define computational mechanisms underpinning safety decision, (2) identify neural circuitry supporting safety acquisition, (3) compare neural substrates to safety acquisition to classical conditioning. In part (1), this proposal will identify the extent to which safety decisions are associated with reflexive model-free learning and more effortful goal-directed model-based learning. By comparing decisions across the valence spectrum from positive reward to negative threat, this research will test how motivation shapes use of decision control systems. In part (2), computational models of learning will be paired with neuroimaging to advance understanding of how the brain supports adaptive safety decisions. Identifying neurocircuitry involved in safety decisions is a necessary precursor to treating anxiety disorders characterized by maladaptive safety decisions. In part (3), safety acquisition decisions will be compared with safety learning in the absence of decision making via classical condition to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive model of safety processing. By combining these methods, this research has the potential to identify overlapping and distinct neural systems involved in recognizing safety and making proactive decisions to acquire safety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nationwide, college students' success in undergraduate engineering programs is commonly hampered by rigorous first-year engineering coursework.  Students often abruptly discover that early engineering courses are especially challenging due to their rapid pace and the wide breadth of challenging technical concepts that must be mastered.  A major influence governing students' performance is their belief in their own capability to succeed.  However, their waning self-confidence and other mental health challenges eventually lead many to withdraw from engineering.  This research initiation project aims to serve the national interest by identifying critical factors that affect students' beliefs and can predict their success and persistence in undergraduate engineering programs.  Of particular significance are the psychological stressors that drive changes in students' confidence on a daily basis, and how such changes affect students' persistence.  The results of the research will inform the development of intervention strategies that could ultimately improve retention rates in engineering programs throughout the country.  This outcome is well aligned with NSF's initiatives to drive a larger and stronger stream of students into the country's STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal is to establish causal links between engineering students' state of mind (self-efficacy, emotion, and motivation) and other major variables including time, demographics, rigor of course content, and psychological stressors.  The research approach will utilize experience sampling (using mobile phone assessment) of students' psychological state on a semi-daily to semi-weekly basis.  These sampling polls will repeatedly solicit students' states of emotion and other factors that may be leading-edge indicators of dropout.  The polls will utilize validated survey instruments such that the research efforts can be replicated by researchers at other institutions.  The data will be analyzed using well-established statistical methods to provide explanations of: (1) which indicators of students' self-efficacy and emotion fluctuate over time, (2) how the difficulty of specific course topics relates to changes in students' self-efficacy, (3) which course-specific aspects and psychological stressors primarily dictate students' self-efficacy, and (4) whether daily changes in emotion and self-efficacy are correlated to student demographics.  These results will enable the research team to scientifically understand how students' emotional fluctuations disrupt (or stem from) their performance in early engineering coursework.  In the long-term, the research efforts could ultimately lead to (a) enhanced interest and motivation, (b) increased persistence in engineering, and (c) the development of novel early warning and intervention systems tailored to the unique backgrounds of at-risk demographic cohorts.  The challenging first-year engineering curricula could be revised to better align with the psychological demands of early engineering students who struggle to adapt to college lifestyle.  In terms of professional development, theoretical knowledge and functional social science research skills will be instilled in three Civil Engineering faculty under the guidance of a faculty mentor from Psychology, all located at the University of Miami.  This project represents a unique opportunity for researchers in these two disparate disciplines to collaborate to address a multidisciplinary problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But as semiconductor technology now faces fundamental physical limits, even while large-scale systems are reaching warehouse scales, new approaches are becoming essential to achieving efficient use of computing resources. In particular, given this divergence of scales, HPC systems have necessarily become more distributed and  asynchronous (in the sense that system clocks are asynchronous), resulting in increasingly variable and unpredictable execution. While these effects are recognized as critical hindrances to HPC performance, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. What is known, however, is that much HPC infrastructure is tasked with dealing with inefficiency derived from asynchrony, variability, and unpredictability, leading to a deep and complex hardware/software support stack. The project team's hypothesis is that while each stack element provides a local solution, it may also exacerbate the global problem: that complexity has resulted in more variability, not less, and made determining its causes more difficult. This project explores the possibility of reversing the trend of ever-increasing complexity by removing and simplifying support layers. This strategy?s achievable gains remain limited, however, while the underlying cause, execution asynchrony, remains unaddressed. The approach begins by leveraging recently developed technology that enables clocks to remain extremely accurate even when distributed on a planetary scale. Such accurate, distributed clocks serve to underpin a virtuous cycle where synchrony establishes baseline predictability, which, in turn, reduces variability, and at each stage of the cycle enables reduction in the complexity of the support stack. A benefit of this approach is that the individual steps are largely simple and can be applied directly to existing software systems. <br/><br/>This one-year project aims to obtain early findings and practical demonstrations for the importance of synchrony and predictability to increase HPC compute efficiency and thereby improve large-scale program execution. Five tasks are conducted. The first is to demonstrate the feasibility of accurate clock distribution by augmenting existing HPC network infrastructure. The second is to demonstrate the application of synchrony in the establishing a virtuous cycle enabling  simplifications to the software/system support stack. The third is to devise mechanisms to model, measure, and validate systems using the proposed methods. The fourth is to investigate the relative benefits of applying the synchrony-based virtuous cycle with respect to various application classes. The fifth is to demonstrate the overall efficacy of the proposed approach through a case study involving a production application. Overall, the project works to  determine whether added synchronization through accurate clocks enables significant improvements to HPC computations in terms of how efficiently they use computational resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the mathematical tools employed in modern signal processing, Fourier analysis stands as one of the key players. In particular, the methods developed in Fourier analysis are instrumental in decomposing complex signals into their elementary building blocks. This project will push the current understanding of several modern tools related to Fourier analysis in applications such as data science, signal processing, and quantum information theory beyond their current frontiers. Moreover, this project's educational component will allow the investigators to continue training students in the underlying mathematics fields it covers. The investigators will also integrate the outcomes of this research program into graduate and advanced undergraduate courses offered at their respective institutions. <br/><br/>The project will solve some fundamental and unresolved problems in time-frequency analysis, especially the Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala (HRT) conjecture (which asserts that every finite collection of time-frequency shifts of a square-integrable function must be linearly independent) and several other related unresolved problems. These problems arise in time-frequency analysis and are at the intersection of many areas of mathematics, applied mathematics, and even engineering. The investigators will attack these problems from a multi-field approach, bringing to bear techniques from abstract, applied computational harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, Lie group, Lie algebra, complex, functional, and real analysis. This research will build on recent successes of applied and pure harmonic analysis, which include the wavelet-based JPEG standard, advances in phaseless reconstruction, and the fundamental role played by Gabor (or Weyl-Heisenberg) systems in the detection of the gravitational waves. A standard paradigm in many of these applications consists of decomposing arbitrary signals into redundant elementary building blocks. While the redundancy of these systems might seem counterintuitive for their use, it is nonetheless responsible for the robustness of certain algorithms for data transmission using unreliable channels. It will play a vital role in noise reduction algorithms. Wavelets and Gabor systems are examples of redundant systems, and such systems can represent many natural signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposed material is similar in cost to lumber and may provide equivalent installation methods, may reduce weight, and may prevent damage due to rot and insects. The proposed initial application is the US agricultural fence post market: 206 million linear feet of fencing or 15 million fence posts annually. Using current lumber prices, this market is estimated to have a current value of $98 million. The softwood sawn dimensional lumber, the targeted industry, has an approximate market value of $39 billion in the United States. Based on initial customer interviews, wood fence posts typically last 10-20 years. The polymers utilized in the proposed material have a useful life of 30-50 years, significantly reducing future costs for end users. Additionally, the reduction in wood usage could reduce the 10 million acres of forest harvested for fence posts each year in the United States. The goal is to develop a material that directly replaces lumber while utilizing low-cost recycled materials and providing a similar or reduced price compared to lumber.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a composite material that matches the driving force and withdrawal force of nails and other fasteners used in wood.  The proposed material utilizes an over jacketing extrusion technique to increase the gross mechanical strength of the section as well as a hollow composite composed of the proposed materials. The innovation requires an increase in the coefficient of friction while reducing the compressive strength to allow for nails to be driven by hand. Over jacketing extrusion must be reconfigured to allow for coextrusion of the bulk composite material with macro-reinforcement, which is similar to the reinforcement method used in reinforced concrete. These requirements must be maintained while allowing for a hollow section to reduce material costs. The project seeks an improved understanding of the influence of additives or fillers based on polymer-based composites. Fillers provide advantages including reduced costs, increased stiffness, and increased compressive strength, and their usage has increased in the polymer industry. Futrue activities will focus on the introduction of fillers for increased friction in mechanically fastened connections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because cetaceans are so long-lived and difficult to study, no synthetic study on the lives of any wild dolphin or whale species from birth to death has been published. The OPUS award will help change that. The Shark Bay Bottlenose Dolphin Project, based in Western Australia, is the largest comprehensive study of any wild dolphin or whale in the world, including behavioral, demographic, ecological, genetic and physiological data on over 1750 dolphins from birth to death. A team of researchers has examined social behavior, social bonds, networks and structure, kinship, tool-use, foraging ecology, lifetime reproductive success, senescence, disease transmission, human impacts, and responses to extreme climate events. Although there are dozens of long-term studies of wild cetaceans (spanning 10+ years), none have this level of detail about the lives of individual animals. The OPUS project has two major goals: (1) Complete 3 books (for 3 distinct audiences: scholars, the public, children) that synthesize 40 years (1984-2023) of longitudinal study on wild bottlenose dolphins; and (2) Make these data available to the public and scientists from diverse fields, thus accelerating our knowledge and advancing our ability to protect wildlife species in general.<br/><br/>The books will synthesize 40 years of research for distinct audiences, but will, in each case, provide insight into the lives of dolphins at the individual and population level. The material will cover the challenges of each life stage (infancy, juvenile period, early and late adulthood), significant topics like tool use and social networks, and the major threats to dolphins (e.g., epidemics, fishing gear entanglement, collapse of food sources, pollution, and extreme climate events). In addition, the OPUS will support integration of image, behavioral, demographic, spatial, and genetic data so that scientists from multiple disciplines can access these datasets. There are few longitudinal databases for any wildlife species that are this comprehensive, with high dimensional complexity, and methodological rigor. The investigator will finalize the relational database (integration of all archival and current data) and create a detailed guide to facilitate access for the next generation of scholars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On average 518,000 preterm infants are born in the US each year and 49% experience difficulty feeding after discharge. Preterm infants who cannot successfully feed are at increased risk of hospital readmission. In the US, there are 22,721 NICU beds and the average length of stay for an infant born less than 32 weeks gestation is 13.2 days. The current practice is for babies to remain longer in the NICU at an average cost of $7,000 per day and a national cost of more than $26 billion a year. This project advances a new feeding monitoring system.  An estimated 2-day reduction in length of stay with this device will lower the financial cost of overall neonatal healthcare expenditure by $8.9 billion annually and will reduce the need for future medical interventions because infants are discharged with a stronger early-stage health baseline. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances NICU care.  For infants admitted to the NICU, successful oral feeding is a prerequisite for discharge home, but preterm infants often struggle with oral feeding skills, due to problems coordinating swallowing with breathing. Achieving safe and efficient oral feeding in preterm infants is challenging because of these neurodevelopmental immaturities. Feeding progress is therefore limited by difficulties in maintaining cardiorespiratory stability. The proposed biomedical platform and clinical algorithm interface uses big data describing breathing patterns to quantify the synchronization of breathing and swallowing. A precise method of measuring infant breathing patterns during feeding gives clinicians a diagnostic tool to better inform decisions related to feeding advancement.  This device provides objective metrics of feeding success and discharge readiness.  It will result in decreased readmissions for failure to thrive, substantially reducing healthcare utilizations and post-discharge expenditures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inertial sensors, including both gyroscopes and accelerometers, are especially important in navigation applications for aviation, marine vehicles including submarines and ships, and space-based transport platforms. Existing technologies are impressive, but still suffer from slight imperfections that lead to significant drifts and imprecision. These imperfections are hard to overcome with standard approaches, since they arise from phenomena such as light scattering that are ubiquitous. In this project, the PI presents a planned program of research that brings to the table a new kind of technology with potential gains in performance and robustness to these adverse effects. The PI will analyze theoretically this new type of inertial sensor founded on a completely novel physical principle.<br/><br/>At the heart of the proposed device is a phenomenon known as superradiance, that is, a term that describes the potentially rapid dissipation of energy in the form of light from an ensemble of atoms when they are prepared in special internal states. The atoms in the superradiant laser gyroscope are coupled together by photons that circulate around a high fitness optical ring resonator. The approach employs special atoms that possess long lived optically excited states; the same states that are used for the best atomic clocks. When compared with existing technologies, the system offers potential performance advantages that arise from the fact that the optical coherence is stored in the atomic dipoles rather than in the optical resonator field. This provides a phase rigidity due to collective effects that avoids the gyroscope being sensitive to the standard adverse imperfections that limit the performance of virtually all gyroscopes in the field.  The outcomes of the project will be quantitative calculations of the ultimate sensitivity and precision, the dynamic range, and an analysis of motional effects in the ensemble. Evaluations will be made of the robustness to noise sources, including homogeneous and inhomogeneous dephasing (primarily Doppler effects), as well as the omnipresent vibrational and thermal fluctuations of the optical cavity length.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This videogame platform emphasizes family engagement, near-peer mentorship, peer collaboration, and expert modeling. The project will develop a unique set of extended and age-appropriate spatial programming functions and engage participants in developing Spatial Computational Thinking Skills (SCT). These skills will support the ability to learn to abstract key spatial features, to decompose shapes with geometric representation and recognize patterns, and to use programming and computing tools for spatial algorithm design. The project will introduce participants to computationally-intensive STEM careers where these skills are increasingly demanded in areas such as robotics, virtual reality, and smart geospatial systems. The project will develop a unique set of bilingual, extended and age-appropriate visual programming functions to enable thousands of upper elementary school students to engage in high-quality spatial programming learning experiences. Participants will be able to access the game in school or at home. Due to low-cost materials and the self-paced learning design, the learning activities are flexible and affordable for families and educators who have different needs.<br/><br/>Through design-based research, the project will address two research questions: 1) How can an immersive virtual learning environment be designed to support upper-elementary school Latinx students' spatial computational thinking skill development, career exploration, and family engagement? 2) What are the immediate and sustained impacts of the program on participating elementary school students, parents/guardians, and college students? The project will begin with usability and feasibility studies that will inform the iterative design of the learning experience and environment, followed up by experimental, controlled studies. The project will collect data using mixed-methods including participant reflections, think-alouds, surveys of career interest development, observations, interviews, data analytics, and assessments of computational, spatial skills and self-efficacy. The research findings revealed through this project can provide rich insights into program designs that foster Latinx students? interest and awareness in computing and effective strategies to support family engagement, peer collaboration, and near-peer mentor facilitation in an immersive virtual learning environment. The project learning environment, teacher professional development sessions, and lesson plans will be shared in the Minecraft World Library to be scaled to a national level, incorporated in afterschool programs, and used in elementary school classrooms as part of computer science education integrated STEAM curriculum.

Sometimes, this water does not take a direct path to the coast, but first enters near-shore lakes next to the glacier, called ice-marginal lakes, which can be dammed by ice. When the ice dams holding the water in these lakes fail, the water can rapidly drain to the coast over several days. The largest ice-marginal lake in Greenland is believed to be Lake Tininnilik, which recently drained into the ocean in 2021. The current low water levels mean that sediments in the lake are now exposed. This will be the first study to measure chemicals, nutrients, and microorganisms in the lake and sediments. It will also determine how lake storage changes the chemistry of water melting from the glacier. With continued climate warming, the amount of water stored in ice-marginal lakes is expected to increase, and determining the chemistry of Lake Tininnilik is important for understanding ecosystem change and carbon cycling in the coastal ocean following drainage. The project leadership includes three women, all of which are ethnic and racial minorities. As part of this project, a web-based virtual reality tour of Lake Tininnilik will be created for anyone to use. The tour will be important for other scientists trying to better understand the layout of the lake and will also be a teaching tool for the public. <br/><br/>Because of erosion and weathering under ice sheets, subglacial waters are rich in macro- and micro-nutrients. These nutrient-rich waters can be directly discharged into the ocean or stored in pro-glacial lakes, including ice-marginal lakes. Lake Tininnilik is a large ice-marginal lake restrained by an ice dam along Sarqardliup Glacier in western Greenland. It drains approximately every 10 years into a local fjord, most recently in 2021, exposing previously inundated sediments. Preliminary work prior to the 2021 drainage shows that iron (an important minor nutrient for marine phytoplankton) is 10 to 100 times greater than glacial meltwater entering the ocean directly. The iron concentrations are also paradoxically high compared to other redox sensitive element concentrations. This project will collect and analyze water samples from different lobes of Lake Tininnilik and exposed sediments to address how ice-marginal lakes change the chemical and microbial composition and availability of nutrients for near-shore and open-ocean ecosystems. Sarqardleq Fjord, into which Lake Tininnilik drains, is an important source of fish for local indigenous populations, and this work will aid future studies seeking to understand how rapid drainage events may affect the marine food web.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The same can be said for the geographic imbalances of energy availability, which are driven by parallel factors. Desalination offers a viable solution to clean-water production from seawater and brackish groundwater. Among desalination techniques, reverse osmosis (RO) membrane separators are the most widely used due to their energy efficiency relative to those based on distillation. However, even advanced multistage RO processes suffer from inefficiencies and inherent operational challenges including membrane fouling and scaling, transient operation due to the need for periodic flushing of the membrane, the computational challenges posed in model-based optimization of RO networks, and the need for high water recovery levels in inland areas where costs are associated with disposal of brine waste. This research program will advance the fundamental understanding of dynamic (batch, semi-batch, and cyclic modes) membrane-based separation processes and will optimize their design and performance during dynamic operation. Specifically, this proposal aims to (i) investigate salt retention, fouling, scaling, and concentration polarization (a measure of solute concentration gradient at the membrane surface) under transient conditions and internal separator geometry design using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), (ii) explore system dynamics and apply optimal control theory to enhance system performance, (iii) develop novel networked process designs, and (iv) validate results using pilot-scale data from local water districts. These objectives will ultimately lead to transformative innovations in dynamic membrane processes to help address the pressing issues in water and energy availability. The project also will provide research opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and high school students. Educational modules on advanced RO system design and operation will be developed to benefit students, researchers, and industrial practitioners in the field.<br/><br/>This proposal presents a vision for developing dynamic reverse osmosis (RO) processes to overcome the practical limitation of the infinite number of membrane stages and inter-stage booster pumps that would be required for (theoretically) optimal desalination system performance under steady operation, the current nominal mode of operation. The challenge to be addressed is the concurrent optimal design of the multistage networked membrane separator system together with determining the optimal time-periodic mode of operating the entire system. Dynamic 3-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques are required for accurate RO module simulations ? however, using these types of simulations in the task of RO network design and optimization is computationally intractable at this time. Therefore, a reduced-order 1-dimensional model with parameters fitted from the detailed CFD simulations and validated against actual desalination plant data will be developed. This reduced model can be efficiently discretized by orthogonal collocation and subsequently will be used to define a rigorous optimal control problem that seeks to minimize energy use and maximize clean water recovery. This research program will leverage current knowledge on the design of pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) processes, a mature industrial technology for gas separations, to guide initial designs for the networked RO desalination systems. Like the planned RO systems, PSA plants operate under transient conditions and feature spatial concentration gradients within the separation units. The dynamic modeling, optimization, and design tools for RO networks inspired by PSA systems will be extended to green power generation systems that effectively operate as RO in reverse: osmotic pressure generated by the permeation of water through a membrane to a saline solution increases the latter?s pressure and volumetric flowrate which is subsequently harvested for power. Overall, this research program will fundamentally advance the set of systems engineering tools available for producing reduced-order simulations from detailed, spatiotemporally distributed transport models needed for the model-based design and optimization of transient chemical processes outside of RO systems. Coupled with this research plan, a range of education and outreach plans focusing on undergraduate researcher support and a unique student exchange program with UCLA is planned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this objective, the CCP-GMM framework will be reformulated into a bi-convex structure. In the two-stage CCP, a piecewise linear decision rule will be integrated with GMM to facilitate more flexible policy representations. The resulting bi-convex problem then can be solved to the global optimum through a combination of second-order cone relaxations, branch-and-bound methods, reformulation-linearization techniques, and optimality-based interval reductions. A vegetable oil blending experiment will be constructed to validate the proposed optimization algorithms, with an objective of edible oil cost minimization subject to the viscosity, energy, and total fat constraints as uncertainties. The proposed research program has transformative potential in that it seeks to improve the use of available data in the optimization process by embedding the identified GMM into the optimization process. This innovative strategy can bypass the difficulty of integral over chance constraints and enable much improved computational efficiency of global optimization. If proven effective, the proposed global optimization algorithms for CCP can be widely applied to complex design problems in the chemical, oil, fuel, and pharmaceutical industries, to reduce cost, enhance safety, and mitigate environmental impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to understand how plants sense the ever-changing environment and reprogram their chromatin landscapes to achieve adaptability and robustness, with a specific focus on exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation. The focus is on epigenetic modifications, the chemical information layered onto the genome that switches genes ?on? or ?off? and which has emerging roles in plant responses to diverse environmental stresses. This study could ultimately enable the development of innovative chromatin-based technology for biomass production and agricultural improvement. In addition, this project will have a broad educational impact by providing multi-disciplinary research training opportunities for students and scientists from diverse backgrounds including those from underrepresented groups such as women and minorities. Another impact will be the development of learning modules to disseminate epigenetic research to the public, including tabletop science stations for K-12 students and a summer science-camp for rural Wisconsin high school students and science teachers. <br/><br/>Cytosine DNA methylation is emerging as a molecular interpreter in sensing and translating extracellular signals to guide diverse cellular and physiological functions. Despite the numerous studies describing altered DNA methylomes in response to environmental stress, little is known about how distinct DNA methylation patterns are generated, maintained, and removed over time during stress. This project will enhance understanding of how plants respond to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation by reprogramming the DNA methylation landscape, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a powerful model. Specifically, this project will investigate how UVB and its photoreceptor interact to alter locus- and tissue-specific DNA methylation and also UVB-induced stress priming and epigenetic memory. Findings from this project will provide mechanistic insights into how signaling cascades intertwine with chromatin dynamics to guide cellular and organismal functions. Given the importance of DNA methylation and signaling cascades in diverse biological processes, understanding how chromatin senses and transduces environmental stimuli is a fundamental question relevant to both plants and animals.

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Michael Pante at the Department of Anthropology and Geography of Colorado State University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the importance of bone marrow to the evolution of our human ancestors and the rise of hunting large animals for food. New technology will be applied to analyze bone breakage patterns related to marrow procurement from modern collections of broken animal bones as well as several zooarchaeological collections that are important for our understanding of human origins. Subsistence underpins human economics, and both the introduction of large animals as a food resource and hunting represent dramatic shifts in subsistence that had profound implications for human social behavior such as cooperation, conflict, and cognition, and thus, major impacts on our evolutionary history.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test the role of bone marrow as the avenue by which early humans began using large animal food resources and its influence on the rise of the Human Predatory Pattern. Among primates, the Human Predatory Pattern (HPP) is the uniquely human behavior of hunting animals that are of equal or larger body size. Evolution of the HPP involves two key innovations: active hunting and exploitation of large animal food resources (LAFRs). The inclusion of LAFRs in the human diet and the HPP may have set the stage for humans to become super-predators, and even precipitated the origin of our genus, Homo. Yet, the mechanism through which this behavioral pattern evolved is unclear. This project will leverage new technological advances in 3D scanning, digital characterization, and machine learning, combined with traditional methods, to analyze bone breakage patterns and test the recently proposed hypothesis that the HPP derived from scavenging large animals for in-bone nutrients. This hypothesis predicts that early humans were breaking bones for marrow prior to other forms of butchery. This hypothesis will be tested by taking a diachronic approach that compares signatures of bone modifications made by early humans. Should the evidence confirm a transition in human exploitation of LAFRs through time, this would support the hypothesis, indicating that the rise of the genus Homo must be interpreted through the lens of scavenging for in-bone nutrients as the precursor to the HPP. This project comprises substantial intellectual merit, both within archaeological sciences but also more broadly in any field where 3D object shape is used in research. First, it will advance our understanding of human evolution by testing a major hypothesis associated with the assembly of modern human behaviors. Second, it will advance knowledge of human-carnivore interactions between 3.6 Ma (Late Pliocene), 1.8 Ma and 0.9 Ma (Pleistocene), the earlier time period having received little attention in this regard. Third, this project will develop methods of data extraction using 3D models that are effective for machine learning applications and broadly applicable to many other archaeological and paleontological assemblages. Fourth, this work extends collaborations among mathematicians, computer and data scientists, and paleoanthropologists to create innovative technological tools to enable researchers (within and beyond anthropology) to easily integrate their expertise with reliable and replicable mathematical approaches to research on objects. Finally, this project will create an extensive open-access database of research-quality 3D models and datasets that will facilitate future research projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project looks at how some proteins protect other proteins when the temperature goes up too high for survival, how proteins that are barely able to fold can fold in the right environment, and how microorganisms that live at high pressures and temperatures cope by harnessing the adaptability of proteins critical for survival. This project will support the training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers on state-of-the-art techniques and instruments, helping the nation be prepared with qualified scientists who can solve problems at every level when we encounter our own extreme scenarios.<br/><br/>This project, focused on protein dynamics inside living cells and organisms, has the goal of understanding how protein evolution optimizes flexibility, develops novel structure and function, and adapts proteins to subtle differences even between different cell types in a single organism.  This will be accomplished through three distinct but related subprojects. A class of intrinsically disordered proteins with low charge/hydropathy ratio will be studied to determine if quinary structure and crowding in cells may be sufficient to induce structure. Using zebrafish as a model organism, heat shock chaperoning will be studied in vivo to determine how protein-chaperone interactions can be differentiated in different tissues. Extremophiles tune the native state fluctuations of enzymes to allow function under a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and other solvent variables.

It focuses on specific remedies and investments needed to retain prospective teachers in high-need schools, especially rural communities, and to improve outcomes for their students. The project includes two complementary studies, one using the National Teacher and Principal Survey (an update from the earlier Schools and Staffing Survey) and a second, using longitudinal administrative data from the states of Kansas and Missouri. The project will explore a range of questions, including: how STEM teacher demographics, turnover intentions, and actual turnover may have changed nationally due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and how the Great Recession of 2007-08 and the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced teacher outcomes. This body of research will produce insights to inform actionable recruitment and retention practices for high-need school districts and future research focused on teacher labor markets.<br/><br/>The conceptual framework and proposed analyses build upon a model of teacher turnover that suggests three main categories of factors that drive teacher turnover: teacher factors, school factors, and external factors and events. Leveraging this framework, the investigators group the research questions and analyses into three broad themes: STEM teacher characteristics, the school and student characteristics in which STEM teachers are employed, and contemporary secular trends that impact STEM teachers. They also consider the interplay between the STEM teacher characteristics and the school context in which STEM teachers work.

Julian Jara-Ettinger and Julia Leonard at Yale University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist studying the development of children?s self-representations. Children?s understanding of the self??what they like, what they know, what they are good at??has a deep influence on their learning and achievement. However, we lack a clear understanding of how exactly children develop views of the self, how these views are affected by their social interactions, and how they impact important real-world behaviors, such as children?s learning decisions. This research will advance fundamental scientific knowledge on children?s self-representations by developing a formal, quantitative theory of how children revise self-representations in social contexts, and how these self-representations impact their learning.<br/><br/>The studies will combine computational and developmental approaches to test the hypothesis that children rationally construct and revise self-representations by integrating their prior experiences with social interactions. First, we will build a computational model that combines self-observations (e.g., failures and successes) with social feedback (e.g., what others think of the self) to explain learning about the self in social contexts. This model will be exhaustively tested and refined through studies with adults and compared against published developmental findings on relevant work. Second, we will use our model and alternative lesioned models to generate and test quantitative predictions for the developmental trajectory of children?s (3- to 6-year-olds) reasoning about the self. These models will make different assumptions about children?s sensitivities to self-observations and social feedback and if and how they integrate these sources of information. Our developmental experiment will systematically vary children?s performance on toys and a teacher?s beliefs about their competence, and test how these inform important learning behaviors: children?s persistence and challenge-seeking. By integrating state-of-the-art computational and developmental methods, this project will shed light on a deeply important learning problem for children: who they are, and what they can do.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fractional (nonlocal) models in science and engineering can account for long range interactions and are notably flexible in being applicable to non-smooth scenarios. Motivated by these facts and several applications, this research area has attracted a significant amount of recent attention on both theoretical and computational fronts. Examples include novel fractional-derivative-based models in imaging, geophysics, plasmas, deep neural networks, minimal surfaces, and phase transitions. These emerging applications have created a need for development of a modern theory, new numerical methods, and subsequent control of the nonlocal fractional models. The NSFE 2022 meeting aims to address most of these topics. A primary goal of the school is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in nonlocal equations, as well as to provide a vibrant networking environment. There will be two (three hour long) mini-tutorial style lectures and six invited talks from leading researchers in the field. <br/><br/>This meeting will advance knowledge in nonlocal modeling, optimal control, numerical analysis, implementation, and software development.

USNA and USMA teach cybersecurity to all first-year students, approximately 2,100 students per year. These institutions provide an ideal population of diverse students who otherwise might not be interested in cybersecurity. As a result this population presents a unique opportunity to understand better how to teach all students cybersecurity concepts. The first goal of the project will examine the relative efficacy of traditional and simulation-based instructional approaches for teaching in FYCCs. The second goal is to develop a community of cybersecurity instructors from the military academies centered on improving teaching and learning in FYCCs by adapting simulation-based teaching practices. The EPIC project will enhance the cybersecurity preparation of our future military leaders and improve cybersecurity education for all, including those attending non-military institutions, thus strengthening national security overall.<br/><br/>The project will conduct a large-scale (6,300+ subjects) quasi-experimental study of a diverse population of students drawn from three years of cohorts of first-year students. This large, diverse study population permits a deep examination of how simulation-based pedagogies affect different student populations. It also permits the exploration of possible student performance variations or possible bias in the assessment tools based on demographics. In year one, the project will study how the approximately 30 instructors at USNA and USMA currently teach cybersecurity in their FYCCs. In year two, the project will introduce simulation-based learning exercises and pedagogies to the FYCCs and assess their effectiveness. In year three, the project will use evaluative data to revise the newly introduced exercises and pedagogies and assess their effectiveness. The project will make all educational materials freely available, including virtual machines. The project will use, adapt, modify, and improve existing materials, carried out by instructors at USNA and USMA, supported by the interdisciplinary research team and UMBC's championship cyberdefense team members. Research methods will include classroom observations, interviews, the percentage of students receiving a D, F, or withdrawing (DFW grade rates), questionnaires, and concept inventories---especially the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes, this water does not take a direct path to the coast, but first enters near-shore lakes next to the glacier, called ice-marginal lakes, which can be dammed by ice. When the ice dams holding the water in these lakes fail, the water can rapidly drain to the coast over several days. The largest ice-marginal lake in Greenland is believed to be Lake Tininnilik, which recently drained into the ocean in 2021. The current low water levels mean that sediments in the lake are now exposed. This will be the first study to measure chemicals, nutrients, and microorganisms in the lake and sediments. It will also determine how lake storage changes the chemistry of water melting from the glacier. With continued climate warming, the amount of water stored in ice-marginal lakes is expected to increase, and determining the chemistry of Lake Tininnilik is important for understanding ecosystem change and carbon cycling in the coastal ocean following drainage. The project leadership includes three women, all of which are ethnic and racial minorities. As part of this project, a web-based virtual reality tour of Lake Tininnilik will be created for anyone to use. The tour will be important for other scientists trying to better understand the layout of the lake and will also be a teaching tool for the public. <br/><br/>Because of erosion and weathering under ice sheets, subglacial waters are rich in macro- and micro-nutrients. These nutrient-rich waters can be directly discharged into the ocean or stored in pro-glacial lakes, including ice-marginal lakes. Lake Tininnilik is a large ice-marginal lake restrained by an ice dam along Sarqardliup Glacier in western Greenland. It drains approximately every 10 years into a local fjord, most recently in 2021, exposing previously inundated sediments. Preliminary work prior to the 2021 drainage shows that iron (an important minor nutrient for marine phytoplankton) is 10 to 100 times greater than glacial meltwater entering the ocean directly. The iron concentrations are also paradoxically high compared to other redox sensitive element concentrations. This project will collect and analyze water samples from different lobes of Lake Tininnilik and exposed sediments to address how ice-marginal lakes change the chemical and microbial composition and availability of nutrients for near-shore and open-ocean ecosystems. Sarqardleq Fjord, into which Lake Tininnilik drains, is an important source of fish for local indigenous populations, and this work will aid future studies seeking to understand how rapid drainage events may affect the marine food web.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bowers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will investigate methods for making artificial enzymes.  Enzymes are proteins that act as the key drivers of metabolic transformations and processes in all cell-based life.  Enzymes are also increasingly important ?green? tools for a variety of industrial processes, including the make and manufacture of pharmaceuticals, materials, fuels, and foods.  Despite significant advances in computational protein design, the creation of useful, efficient, artificial enzymes remains a major challenge.  This is due to the need to fashion proteins that are capable of simultaneously 1) holding a substrate (or binding) and 2) modifying the substrate (or catalysis).  The proposed experiments will test a potentially generalizable strategy for enzyme design that separates substrate binding and catalysis for peptide-based substrates.  This work employs cutting edge technologies and will provide rich training grounds for graduate students in high-throughput experimentation, DNA-encoded technology, computational protein design, and machine learning and artificial intelligence.  These methods will also form the foundations of a focused outreach program to bring emerging concepts in biotechnology to the broader public.  Ultimately, if successful,  this research has the potential to open up new avenues for the design of enzyme function and enable the biocatalytic synthesis of peptides with new properties and biomaterials applications.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to quantitatively characterize efficiency gains in designer peptide post-translational modification (PTM) enzymes comprised of separate substrate recruitment and modification domains.  This constitutes a potentially generalizable approach to creating artificial PTM enzymes.  Rosetta design suite will be used to fashion designer interfaces between the fyn-SH3 substrate recruitment domain and two different catalytic domains for comparison against naive (or undesigned) fusions as well as the parent, wild-type catalytic subunit in kinetic assays.  Generalizability and flexibility of the strategy will be measured by an innovative, mRNA display-based substrate display assay approach and results analyzed and integrated with advanced machine learning (ML) methods.  These model enzymes will further be employed to assess the additive effect of the design strategy on small, designer biosynthetic pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is therefore key to better understand the distribution and behavior of natural sources of methane emissions and how both may change in an evolving climate. In the Arctic, large reservoirs of methane are currently trapped as permafrost (frozen soil) or gas hydrates (an ice-like substance that contains methane in its structure) on Arctic Ocean continental shelves. As the Arctic warms, permafrost and gas hydrates may degrade, releasing more methane to the atmosphere. This project, part of the United States? contribution to the international Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS), is determining whether rates of Arctic methane release from those natural sources are being affected by the present warming by measuring methane in Arctic Ocean from northern Alaska to the North Pole. The team is focusing especially on how much methane released from the seafloor reaches the water surface and adds to atmospheric methane. The team is sharing methane data and other results with the larger US SAS effort and teaching community college students about seagoing research methods and climate change.<br/> <br/>This project is testing the hypothesis that a warming Arctic Ocean may have accelerated the release of methane from permafrost and gas hydrate dissociation in shelf and slope sediments. The research team is measuring water column dissolved methane concentrations and stable isotopologues, as well as continuous measurements of methane in air underway along a transect from the Alaska Shelf northward. The team members are investigating the sources and processes controlling the presence of methane using methane 13C and 2H stable isotopes. Clumped isotopes of methane in air are being analyzed on selected samples identified as possible methane endmembers in the Arctic system. The project is a US contribution to the international Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) and is providing a baseline for measurements in the future of Arctic conditions. The measurement of the stable isotope 2H-CH4 in the Arctic Basin is the first performed in deep Arctic waters and is greatly improving our understanding of the Arctic methane cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator aims to construct new algorithms for finding paths between vertices of graphs whose structure underlies certain number theoretic questions, as well as algorithms for finding short cycles in these graphs. Advances will have implications for both the security of hash functions and number theory itself. The project is multidisciplinary and will bring together experts from number theory and cryptography. It is also seeking to involve younger scientists at both the undergraduate and graduate level.<br/><br/>Recent work has shed light on the so-called Markoff mod-p graphs that underly many arithmetic questions about Markoff triples. This family of graphs, conjectured to be an expander family, is the basis of a cryptographic hash function introduced by the investigator and collaborators. Many questions remain about the security of this hash function and about graphs connected to generalizations of the Markoff surface, which may be even better candidates for a hash. One such question concerns lifts of mod-p Markoff triples to integer Markoff triples, and the investigator plans to prove results on the average sizes of these lifts. Such results would feed into understanding the run time of an attack. The investigator will also work to compare the security of the new hash functions to hash functions that are accepted as secure today by equating and drawing parallels between path finding in the Markoff mod-p graphs and questions that are known to be difficult. A new quick path finding algorithm, while unfortunate from the cryptographic point of view, would have important consequences from the number-theoretic viewpoint. Finally, the investigator will continue her number theoretic work on thin groups, such as the one lurking behind Markoff triples. She aims to extend results on local to global principles in various circle packings; currently such a principle is known to exist when the symmetry group connected to the packing contains certain nice groups, and she plans to relax this restriction. Another goal of the project is to establish results on thickened prime components in Apollonian packings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental goal of STEM education is science literacy, or empowering people to make informed decisions about challenging real-world issues. Science literacy necessitates that individuals and groups understand and use scientific evidence in the process of problem-solving and decision-making about complex issues. This community-level science literacy can be supported in classrooms, and requires building skills such as collaboratively discussing ideas, making sense of scientific evidence to reach a conclusion, and reaching a consensus on solutions to complex environmental, medical, and technological social problems. The goal of this project is to produce instructional tools that effectively engage students in collaborative evaluation of scientific evidence to address and consider solutions to socioscientific issues (SSIs). This project plans to develop and refine these instructional tools in the context of an undergraduate science literacy course in which students work collaboratively to evaluate scientific evidence to address SSIs. The research team will work with students to create strategies that support effective evaluation of evidence in SSIs. These strategies will then be implemented in the science literacy course and in a chemistry course to assess the their effectiveness in different course contexts. Ideally, these instructional tools will be refined for wide distribution and use across STEM courses. Ultimately, this work has potential to lead to a greater understanding of how undergraduate students collectively reason through evidence when considering possible solutions to complex SSIs. <br/><br/>The project will lean on theories of social constructivism and situated cognition, and educational psychology and science education literature on classroom discourse and argumentation, to perform foundational, design-based research using qualitative and quantitative data. The project plans to describe challenges students face in critical evaluation of evidence during community deliberation and to assess teaching tools that support proficiency of this practice. This project will address two research questions: (1) What are effective strategies for community deliberation (e.g., discourse patterns and critical questions), when evaluating evidence to solve an SSI problem? (2) Do instructional activities based on co-created strategies for improved community deliberation (e.g., critical questions) impact students? ability as individuals and groups to apply scientific evidence in an SSI decision-making context? The research team will track the evidence-evaluation progress of several teams of students in the science literacy course and perform clinical group interviews that will simultaneously allow researchers to describe proficiencies in group discourse and develop strategies for improved group deliberation in subsequent course assignments (e.g., critical questions that improve group sense-making). These strategies, co-created by students and researchers during the interviews, will be evaluated for their impact within the interdisciplinary science literacy course during design-based research. The project will also translate and evaluate the strategies in a disciplinary chemistry course context. The proposed work is intended to provide a fundamental understanding of how undergraduate students reason during evidence evaluation in the context of decision-making about complex SSIs. This work will be foundational for future research on models for student learning and teaching about evidence evaluation, particularly in large post-secondary classrooms, and will support long-term goals to understand the role of science education in supporting science literacy practices.

Structural materials are the building blocks of modern lifestyle, supporting applications ranging from infrastructure to national security, yet the mechanisms underlying their failure are not well understood. The first stage of catastrophic failure is often the nucleation of small voids, through a complex and multifaceted process that has so far evaded simplified models. This project will leverage advanced machine learning methods, which can identify subtle trends in large datasets, with damage mechanics models to unravel the nuances of pore nucleation. The result will be a computer model that is able to rapidly screen materials to determine damage susceptibility. The educational part of this project is twofold. First, the project will make advances in machine learning-based mechanics of materials accessible to budding and amateur engineers and scientists through an internet-based application, called ?Solid Genius.? Solid Genius will be freely available, allowing direct manipulation and exploration of the material model and its predictive capability through a user-friendly educational interface. Second, the project will develop a new graduate course to provide training for rising researchers in machine learning-based damage mechanics.<br/><br/>Experimental evidence indicates that grain boundaries are preferential sites for pore nucleation, but no meaningful correlations between grain boundary properties and failure likelihood have yet been conclusively established. A multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) machine learning framework is planned that will be able to identify potential pore nucleation sites in pristine microstructure. The framework will simultaneously account for both nonlocal properties (microstructure, grain texture, etc.) and local properties (pointwise curvature, inclination, etc.), synthesizing them against a training dataset to produce a reliable estimator of failure likelihood. Training data will consist of reconstructed experimental micrographs and EBSD data, divided into ?failure? and ?no-failure? partitions. The raw experimental data will then be enriched with secondary calculations and supplemental mechanics simulations to supply non-visible channels such as grain boundary energy and mechanical stress. The trained MCCNN framework will then be used in concert with a damage mechanics model to further probe the early-time behavior of pore initiation and growth. Development will include an emphasis on determining physical interpretability of each aspect of the MCCNN model, such as formalizing the connection between individual convolutional layers and feature segmentation in microstructure, to facilitate a more rigorous application of the framework to the problem of damage assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principal investigators at Georgia Southern University (GSU) and Mississippi State University will recruit and provide initial training and preparation for cohorts of six U.S. undergraduates each year for three years. The PIs have had previous and ongoing collaborations on advanced controls of power electronic converters and interacted with the Center of Reliable Power Electronics (CORPE) in AAU Energy (formerly known as the Department of Energy Technology). Some European countries are currently leading the research on the practical use of renewables in smart grids. AAU?s power program is one of the largest and youngest in Europe, consistently ranked No. 1 across the continent. AAU Energy and CORPE are ranked among the best for Research Impact Measures. It is an ideal partner for the proposed project?offering U.S. students a unique international research experience in all areas of power electronic systems. This research benefits society and the environment by 1) increasing the penetration of renewables, 2) increasing career interest in the field of power electronic systems for modern power grids, and 3) improving the quality and quantity of the U.S. power engineering workforce. Theories confirmed by project research may be tailored and broadly developed for other systems in the power and energy industry. GSU and MSU are ready, willing, and singularly able to recruit underrepresented minorities, including women, African Americans, Native Americans, and Latin American, to participate in STEM research and teaching. Moreover, the women leading the power/energy system research at CORPE are excellent role models in an area where women remain underrepresented. Students will be engaged in multidisciplinary topics?advanced controls and reliability analysis techniques of power electronic systems in modern power grids with the integration of renewables?trained to conduct innovative STEM projects with broad impacts on the energy sector?s reliability, resilience, and efficiency. They will be exposed to cutting-edge laboratories, unique reliability analysis tools, and international training to prepare them for national and international careers. This program will facilitate a unique knowledge/experience transfer mechanism, help students build international ties and confidence, and pave the way for future NSF and Danish National Research Foundation collaborations.<br/><br/>Looking to the power system workforce of the future, our students need to understand and analyze different power systems as they may be involved in various projects worldwide while working at national or international companies with technical teams in the U.S. Also, power systems are rapidly and increasingly globalizing and modernizing in response to global policies driven by climate change. In the IRES work, students will conduct cohort-based research projects associated with ac/dc power electronic converters [voltage-source converters (VSCs)] in a possible globe-spanning supergrid (GS2G)?an essential component of the energy sector to integrate renewables to respond to urgent environmental concerns caused by global warming at an alarming rate and international agreements. Under the umbrella of smart grids, they assess and improve the reliability of VSCs with innovative controls in GS2G. The proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge related to 1) enhancing the stability and performance of VSCs in GS2G, 2) integrating renewables into power and energy systems via GS2G?s ac/dc grids, 3) achieving more reliable energy exchange and secure power transfer through VSCs, and 4) employing state-of-the-art technologies to test VSC performance and reliability. In this collaboration, students will rigorously investigate technical aspects of VSCs with advanced controls and reliability analysis techniques for GS2G?s VSCs. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and the non-Lead portion is co-funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes, this water does not take a direct path to the coast, but first enters near-shore lakes next to the glacier, called ice-marginal lakes, which can be dammed by ice. When the ice dams holding the water in these lakes fail, the water can rapidly drain to the coast over several days. The largest ice-marginal lake in Greenland is believed to be Lake Tininnilik, which recently drained into the ocean in 2021. The current low water levels mean that sediments in the lake are now exposed. This will be the first study to measure chemicals, nutrients, and microorganisms in the lake and sediments. It will also determine how lake storage changes the chemistry of water melting from the glacier. With continued climate warming, the amount of water stored in ice-marginal lakes is expected to increase, and determining the chemistry of Lake Tininnilik is important for understanding ecosystem change and carbon cycling in the coastal ocean following drainage. The project leadership includes three women, all of which are ethnic and racial minorities. As part of this project, a web-based virtual reality tour of Lake Tininnilik will be created for anyone to use. The tour will be important for other scientists trying to better understand the layout of the lake and will also be a teaching tool for the public. <br/><br/>Because of erosion and weathering under ice sheets, subglacial waters are rich in macro- and micro-nutrients. These nutrient-rich waters can be directly discharged into the ocean or stored in pro-glacial lakes, including ice-marginal lakes. Lake Tininnilik is a large ice-marginal lake restrained by an ice dam along Sarqardliup Glacier in western Greenland. It drains approximately every 10 years into a local fjord, most recently in 2021, exposing previously inundated sediments. Preliminary work prior to the 2021 drainage shows that iron (an important minor nutrient for marine phytoplankton) is 10 to 100 times greater than glacial meltwater entering the ocean directly. The iron concentrations are also paradoxically high compared to other redox sensitive element concentrations. This project will collect and analyze water samples from different lobes of Lake Tininnilik and exposed sediments to address how ice-marginal lakes change the chemical and microbial composition and availability of nutrients for near-shore and open-ocean ecosystems. Sarqardleq Fjord, into which Lake Tininnilik drains, is an important source of fish for local indigenous populations, and this work will aid future studies seeking to understand how rapid drainage events may affect the marine food web.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. While different versions of a gene can produce differences in the way a trait looks, variation can also arise due to differences in the way a genome is structured. For example, different populations within a species might possess different numbers of chromosomes. When individuals from different populations reproduce, this difference in genome structure might result in lower survival and lower reproduction of offspring. Over time these incompatibilities can lead to the accumulation of differences between populations and possibly lead to the formation of new species. This project studies how aspects of the environment and the genome influence survival and reproduction when chromosome numbers differ. This research focuses on the endangered Pacific pocket mouse, and will help inform the adaptive management of this species. Overall, this work will broaden our understanding of how and when differences in genome structure lead to populations becoming distinct, and possibly different species. Additionally, the DNA sequences generated by this project provide opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to develop skills in DNA analysis through project based learning.  <br/><br/>This project combines lab and field techniques to understand the influence of a chromosomal rearrangement on fitness using the Pacific pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris pacificus) as a model. The Pacific pocket mouse occurs in three isolated populations that have each become fixed for one of two different chromosome numbers following a chromosomal fission or fusion event. This research (1) assesses the frequency of the chromosomal rearrangement over time using historical and contemporary samples, (2) measures the fitness effects of outbreeding and identifies associated genomic regions, and (3) models and tests for associations between genotype and the environment. This project provides unique training opportunities to incorporate diverse datasets including fitness measures, genomic data, and habitat modeling. The data generated by this work also provides ample data for smaller research questions, ideal for independent research projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Heath Organization, poor indoor air quality is responsible for 1.6-4.3  million deaths yearly. According to the EPA, Americans, on average, spend 90% of their time indoors, where the concentrations of some pollutants are often 2 -5 times higher than outdoors. Opening windows and increasing air exchange rates can significantly improve Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and can also reduce the risk of COVID exposure. In the current market, window that can automatically open/close and/or pump air into or out of a room to improve the IAQ are not available. The proposed technology is an automated solution that can bring fresh air inside in to improve IAQ. The technology may also work with other smart home systems to share and store IAQ data for scientific research, pattern recognition, and forecasting, potentially triggering new discoveries. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology that can provide improved indoor air quality. The technology can automatically detect poor indoor air quality and can initiate an air exchange to lower pollution levels. The device is portable, plug and play, easy to install (does not require any modifications of existing windows), low energy (run by solar power/phone charger), and made from flexible responsive polymer actuators that pumps air in/out. The window is available in different sizes and shapes to fit conventional spaces and can also be custom made for specific purposes. The window is programmed to automatically respond to changes in temperature, humidity, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other gases, and can be integrated with popular home automation systems and platforms. The technology may help to ensure healthy indoor air quality using an automatic indoor-outdoor air exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

USNA and USMA teach cybersecurity to all first-year students, approximately 2,100 students per year. These institutions provide an ideal population of diverse students who otherwise might not be interested in cybersecurity. As a result this population presents a unique opportunity to understand better how to teach all students cybersecurity concepts. The first goal of the project will examine the relative efficacy of traditional and simulation-based instructional approaches for teaching in FYCCs. The second goal is to develop a community of cybersecurity instructors from the military academies centered on improving teaching and learning in FYCCs by adapting simulation-based teaching practices. The EPIC project will enhance the cybersecurity preparation of our future military leaders and improve cybersecurity education for all, including those attending non-military institutions, thus strengthening national security overall.<br/><br/>The project will conduct a large-scale (6,300+ subjects) quasi-experimental study of a diverse population of students drawn from three years of cohorts of first-year students. This large, diverse study population permits a deep examination of how simulation-based pedagogies affect different student populations. It also permits the exploration of possible student performance variations or possible bias in the assessment tools based on demographics. In year one, the project will study how the approximately 30 instructors at USNA and USMA currently teach cybersecurity in their FYCCs. In year two, the project will introduce simulation-based learning exercises and pedagogies to the FYCCs and assess their effectiveness. In year three, the project will use evaluative data to revise the newly introduced exercises and pedagogies and assess their effectiveness. The project will make all educational materials freely available, including virtual machines. The project will use, adapt, modify, and improve existing materials, carried out by instructors at USNA and USMA, supported by the interdisciplinary research team and UMBC's championship cyberdefense team members. Research methods will include classroom observations, interviews, the percentage of students receiving a D, F, or withdrawing (DFW grade rates), questionnaires, and concept inventories---especially the Cybersecurity Concept Inventory. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

Biological wastewater treatment (WWT) also plays a critical role in ecosystem and environmental protection including the use of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to remove and convert excess nitrogen from wastewater to harmless nitrogen (N2) gas. Advances in environmental metagenomics are providing more detailed and in-depth information about microbial communities in WWT systems. Yet, environmental engineers and wastewater practitioners lack strategies and tools to leverage this new information to control the structure, composition, functional diversity, and metabolic pathways of nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial communities in WWT systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER proposal is to harness various forms of microbial communication signals, commonly referred to as quorum sensing (QS) molecules, to advance the design and operations of more efficient and sustainable biofilm reactors for nitrogen removal. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the development and implementation of next generation biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of a post-doctoral fellow, a graduate student, and three undergraduate students at Howard University.<br/><br/>Advances in environmental microbiology, microbial ecology, and environmental biotechnology are providing unprecedented opportunities to design and build next generation biofilm reactors for the simultaneous removal of excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from wastewater. Biofilm reactors are enabling WWTPs and WRRFs to harness slow growing microorganisms that are advantageous to BNR processes including anaerobic ammonium oxidizers (anammox) and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizers (DAMO). However, the design and operation of next generation biofilm reactors for BNR will require the control of the biofilm microbial ecology to achieve more efficient and cost-effective nitrogen removal from wastewater. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to explore the use of quorum sensing (QS) to control and manipulate the microbial ecology of bacterial biofilms used in BNR reactors. QS involves the generation and release of signaling molecules known as autoinducers that enable bacterial communities to coordinate their behavior including the formation of biofilms. The guiding hypotheses of this research are that the presence of autoinducers changes the activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria and QS can be used to alter which organisms colonize a biofilm. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) Test the effect of autoinducers in cultures enriched for nitrogen cycling bacteria; (2) Evaluate the effect of autoinducers in nitrogen cycling bacteria in more complex biofilm communities; (3) Develop a biofilm model that incorporates QS; and (4) Evaluate a control strategy that uses autoinducer molecules in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of fundamental knowledge to advance the development and deployment of the new process of quorum enhanced sustainable treatment of nitrogen (QuEST-N) within WWTPs and WRRFs. To achieve the educational and training goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator will leverage her ongoing collaboration with the Water Environment Federation (WEF) to 1) add a research training component to the InFLOW (Increasing Opportunities in Water) program at Howard University and 2) expand the program to other minority serving institutions (MSI) to advance diversity in STEM education and broaden participation in the water industry workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may serve as a model and impetus for similar institutions of higher education to develop degree programs in the behavioral sciences.  The connection of faculty to the development of novel opportunities for programs of study that ensure successful transfer to local employment, particularly tribal employment, or to post-baccalaureate studies at nearby universities will demonstrate the essentiality of engaging full-time, credentialed STEM faculty devoted to a specific strand of study and preparation. Moreover, for those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is crucially important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>This project provides an accredited STEM bachelor's of science (BS) degree option in the behavioral sciences at Sisseton Wahpeton College (SWC) for students who may then transfer to a local university for graduate studies or be prepared for employment at local, particularly tribal, service organizations. The BS project builds on a well established associate degree (AS) in behavioral sciences, which has been a popular degree choice for SWC students.  The increase in specialized STEM faculty ensures the curricular offerings have relevance to related programs of study, ensuring the option for students to minor as well as major in the behavioral sciences, and provides sufficient breadth in the degree coursework to prepare students for a broad range of employment positions available on the Lake Traverse Reservation.  Strengthening the mathematics and language arts assists student success in many programs of study, not only those in STEM.

This effort addresses issues such as data governance, compliance, data protection, and security and privacy management capabilities. In collaboration with cybersecurity professionals representing organizations at both the national and regional levels, cybersecurity service providers, and industry experts, AIHEC is developing a networked TCU cybersecurity community of practice (CoP) and a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) as the seminal aspect of this effort to support cybersecurity capacity building and sustainability. In addition to growing a TCU CI/cybersecurity CoP and NIC, AIHEC is advising the TCUs in making informed decisions when selecting providers and partners to support and strengthening their cybersecurity position and reducing their risk profile. Experiences and best practices are shared through the TCU CI/cybersecurity CoP, thus leveraging TCU experiences and lessons learned. <br/><br/>The TCUs have small, under-resourced IT departments too limited to assess, secure, and monitor the network vulnerabilities that expose the education and research missions of the institution. This state puts their entire curriculum, including STEM and language and culture preservation, at risk for security breaches. As part of this initiative, AIHEC is developing shared resources such as a TCU-specific cybersecurity assessment framework and supporting the development of a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) and virtual Security Operations Center (vSOC) at a TCU through the CI/Cybersecurity CoP. In addition to creating a more secure and aware environment, these enhancements will allow TCU administration, faculty and staff to increase their focus on the academic and research missions of their institutions. A cybersecurity strategy that guides the entire TCU community in a comprehensive short and long-term, cybersecurity posture will lower the TCU community?s threat level.

Yet, as individuals age, remaining socially active can become challenging. For example, many older adults relocate for retirement, experience changes in mobility, or begin losing family and friends, which may weaken the fabric of their social network. Because of this, older adults are at risk of experiencing feelings of loneliness and social isolation, which may lead to declines in mental and physical health. This project will investigate the potential of emerging conversational user interfaces such as voice assistants and chatbots to help older adults stay connected with the world around them, thus improving their social wellness. By engaging older adults in the design process and adapting state-of-the-art conversational design methods, this work will develop empirically validated novel strategies for personalized conversational interfaces that leverage real-world social connections and motivate older adults to engage in social activities with other people. The project will also yield new curriculum, experiential learning opportunities, community engagement initiatives, and tools to aid reflective thinking of the impact of artificially intelligent technologies on an increasingly aging society.<br/><br/>This project leverages social-behavioral theories to identify and examine a new family of conversational interaction approaches for supporting older adults in maintaining and building social relationships with others. To do so, the team will employ participatory methods that leverage close community collaborations with senior organizations and older adults. The research will include three main aims. First, the team will generate an empirical account of the needs of older adults to maintain social wellness in an interconnected world, along with situations that pose risks of isolation. Second, the team will explore conversational design principles to support collaborative two-way dialogues that encourage engagement in social wellness activities, with particular attention to people's concerns about privacy and aspects of the situation where they are using the system. Finally, the team will develop and evaluate a novel platform implementing tested conversational strategies to motivate older adults' participation in socially meaningful activities. This project will advance knowledge of the uses, challenges, and real-world barriers of designing and deploying conversational user interfaces to support older adults' social wellness, contributing to human-centered artificial intelligence, aging, and conversational design. The research is expected to reveal new approaches that can benefit older adults' social wellness while decreasing the risk of social isolation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria use biochemical cell-to-cell communication via diffusible molecules and gene regulatory elements to bring about large-scale responses. The ability to predictably design multicellular responses in diverse bacterial communities would have a wide range of applications including efficient biomanufacturing, bioenergy conversion, novel therapeutic strategies, sustainable agriculture, and bioremediation. To date, numerous naturally occurring interactions and modes of communication within bacterial communities have been identified, yet there is not the ability to engineer synthetic bacterial communities that have these complex interactions and dynamic responses among diverse bacteria. This collaborative project aims to improve understanding of interspecies biochemical cell-cell communication that can occur in natural microbial communities and allow us to leverage the highly complex functions afforded by these systems within synthetic diverse bacterial communities as programmable living devices. This project will create synthetic bacterial consortia for biosensing and bioremediation of many hazardous water contaminants, including some of the most dangerous drinking water and aquatic ecosystem contaminants. This project will provide education and research training for numerous K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Hands-on workshops will be run at UMass Amherst and Boston University each year for high school students to learn about studying and engineering bacterial communities. Many undergraduate opportunities for synthetic biology research training will be created. These educational activities will increase K-12 STEM education, help address the underrepresentation of women and minorities in synthetic biology, and train the next generation of scientists and engineers. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a generalizable framework for the design of multicellular transcriptional regulatory networks distributed within bacterial communities containing gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The universality of recent discoveries of homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing in gram-positive bacteria will be determined using libraries of LuxRI-type quorum sensing systems and model gram-positive bacteria. This work will generate a set of standardized quorum sensors for gram-positive bacteria that allow for controlling interspecies communication between diverse bacteria. The sequence-function relationship for these quorum sensing systems will be determined using statistical design and systematic mutagenesis. Using these quorum sensors, the team will test fundamental questions about the evolution of quorum sensing in bacteria. A high-throughput multilayer microfluidics platform for studying and maintaining bacterial communities will be developed to analyze temporal signaling at single-cell resolution. This platform will be used to develop a database of parameters and models to predict the signaling dynamics of these distributed transcriptional regulatory networks.

By contrast, animal eggs are exceptionally large cells; bird eggs are single enormous cells. All animals produce eggs with an elaborate cell (the germline) that has many inter-connected compartments that become eggs. In some animals, such as the one the investigators use, the germline cell operates as a conveyor belt; compartments and their contents are displaced from one end of the germline to the other as they grow. It is not known how the compartments maintain connection with each other, and how these connections change as compartments enlarge and mature. This project will uncover the mechanisms of this process. The Broader Impacts of the project include the intrinsic merit of the work itself as all animal eggs (including those of humans) utilize some form of this process. Additionally, the work will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers along with high school teachers. Additional outreach work will bring science into local gradeschools.<br/><br/>The investigators use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The project will make use of the extensive genetics available in this system and employ state of the art live microscopic imaging approaches to observe and measure germline compartment dynamics. For compartments at different positions along the germline, and as compartments are born, die, or enlarge, the investigators will compare the size of the compartment and its associated ?doorway? to the shared central core. They also compare the amount of various cellular components on compartment walls and doorways, focusing on players that convey biochemical information or that rearrange to generate force. Not all compartments ultimately become oocytes; some undergo programmed cell death. The investigators will study the role of this process in germline architecture and oogenesis. Computer modeling will generate testable predictions that they will test with simulations and biological experiments. Execution of the research and the outreach activities will define mechanisms of cell structure and egg production, strengthen scientific research potential, and increase research diversity during the funding period and for generations to come.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an increased demand for fast, continuous environmental surveillance in city sewers. These confined spaces occupy a large portion of a city's infrastructure. However, today's conventional robots, including ground and aerial systems, cannot operate in a vast majority of sewers. Sewer networks present a veritable maze of pipes, chambers, and utility holes that pose tremendous challenges for robot locomotion control and navigation. Therefore, human operators still inspect these dangerous spaces. In addition to carrying many risks for humans, manned operations in these environments are costly and slow. This grant?s research will contribute to the design of aerial, bat-inspired robots that can operate in sewers, by mimicking bat aerial locomotion principles in caves. The results from this research will greatly benefit the society. Especially during a pandemic, the continuous and automated monitoring of a city?s aging sewer systems using these bat-inspired drones can play a vital role in saving human lives. For instance, SARS-CoVs can be present in wastewater for several days, and its early detection in sewers in 2019 could have allowed for increased preparedness in combating the current pandemic. This project trains new generation scientists, engineers, and technologists with interdisciplinary skills, providing future professionals with vertically integrated, use-inspired experiential learning activities.<br/><br/>Today's rotary-wing drones are better solutions for inspection and monitoring city infrastructure than ground robots because they are scalable, inexpensive, easy to deploy, and possess fast mobility. However, these systems cannot fly inside tight areas such as tunnels with small cross-sections because they rely on powerful and continuous air jets. So far, the confined space applications of these drones include only flying inside buildings or very spacious confined environments, which are not comparable to the application of aerial robots in sewers. This research will allow drones to complete fully autonomous flights inside tight spaces such as sewer galleries. The research team will (i) use an integrated mechanical intelligence and control framework to design drones with dynamically versatile body conformations and significant computational complexity to prevent creation of powerful air jets, (ii) design an integrated model-based and data-driven flight control framework that captures not only the model uncertainty but also the environmental aerodynamic effects that arise due to flight in tunnels, and (iii) develop a novel navigation framework that relies on high-level abstract guidance extracted from sewer schematic diagrams, enabling robust navigation in unmapped environments.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effective removal and destruction of organohologen pollutants by water treatment will require novel and targeted approaches as these compounds are often present at very dilute concentrations in drinking water sources. Treatment technologies which generate reactive solvated electrons (SE) are promising approaches to degrade organohalogens in aqueous solutions via chemical reduction. However, the efficacy of a SE-based water treatment process is hindered by competing reactions with co-occurring contaminants and interfering reactions between solvated electrons and dissolved organic/inorganic species present in drinking water sources. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to design, synthesize, characterize, and evaluate new composite media capable of targeted separation and catalytic reductive dehalogenation to address the limitations of current SE-based water treatment processes. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new water treatment media and fundamental knowledge to advance the development and deployment of more efficient and cost-effective technologies to remove and destroy organohalogen pollutants from drinking water sources. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of a graduate student and five undergraduate students at the University of Washington.<br/><br/>Organohalogens such as PCBs and PFAS are extremely stable in natural and engineered aquatic systems. They are also resistant to degradation using conventional biological and chemical water treatment processes. The generation of solvated electrons in aqueous solutions is a promising approach to cleave carbon-halide bonds and facilitate organohalogen degradation/destruction in contaminated drinking water sources. However, solvated electrons (SE) are easily scavenged and may not react with the targeted organohalogen pollutants as they may be consumed by other co-contaminants and dissolved organic/inorganic species which often exist in drinking water sources. This CAREER project will address the critical limitations of current SE-based water treatment processes for organohalogen removal. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator (PI) will explore the development of new composite media consisting of 1) molecularly imprinted polymer shells that can selectively extract organohalogens and 2) vanadium carbide catalytic cores with demonstrated potential to generate solvated electrons and degrade organohalogens. The specific objectives of the research include: (1) media design, synthesis, and characterization, (2) measurements of media sorption capacity and selectivity, (3) experimental investigations of media catalytic activity, (4) evaluation of media performance in complex water matrices in the presence of competing dissolved organic/inorganic species; and (5) evaluation of media reusability. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of fundamental knowledge to advance the development and deployment of more efficient and cost-effective media to remove organohalogen contaminants from drinking water sources. To implement the educational and training goals of this CAREER project, the PI will lead a newly developed seminar course for senior-level undergraduate and graduate students about organohalogen properties, exposure, toxicity, and remediation. Additionally, the PI and her students plan to partner with the Duwamish Valley Youth Corps to design a culturally appropriate workshop outlining unique organohalogen exposure pathways and risks closely associated with indigenous lifestyles including subsistence and dietary practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines the question by tracing the ways that wartime experiences shape ordinary Ukrainians? attitudes toward different peace settlement scenarios. It focuses specifically on how people?s experiences and characteristics shape their dispositions toward potential territorial concessions. Such concessions are presently recognized by all sides as part of the road toward peace. Yet, in light of great resistance and suffering, witnessing the death of friends and family members, and extraordinary destruction and displacement, the question can be raised whether ordinary Ukrainians accept the loss of further state territory as a necessary price for peace. Deeper understanding of how general populations assess the cost of peace can greatly inform preparation, negotiation and implementation of peace agreements by both national governments and international third parties. <br/><br/>To advance understanding of how people?s wartime experiences influence their positions toward peace agreements requiring territorial concessions, this project seeks to uncover the social psychological processes and wartime experiences informing the dispositions of ordinary Ukrainians toward peace. The scholarly literature suggests divergent impacts of war experience on attitude towards the costs of peace. One line of evidence suggests that direct exposure to violence and destruction may increase Ukrainians? perception of immediate threat, which may in turn increase their willingness to support territorial concessions as a means to end violent hostilities. Other lines of evidence suggest that anger, threats to Ukrainian identity and values, and desire to honor the sacrifice of those who died defending Ukrainian land, may harden attitudes toward territorial compromises. In this context, war may have made all Ukrainian territory a ?sacred value? (absolute and non-negotiable) to ordinary Ukrainians. This would reduce the possibility of territorial compromise, and make any settlement potentially unstable. This study uses multiple methods to explore the complex factors that come into play as people work to resolve these dilemmas. The project includes collection and quantitative analysis of survey data from a large sample of Ukrainians, including locals and internally displaced people, across three towns close to the regions where active fighting is taking place. The survey is used to identify small groups of citizens across the same three towns to participate in focus groups. These discussions provide further opportunity to learn about how citizens make sense of and assess tradeoffs associated with a potential peace agreement. Integrated analysis of the survey and group discussions inform the development of theoretical and practical implications for scholars, policymakers and practitioners focused on peace agreements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, natural processes driven by plate tectonics mean that this sedimentary record is inherently incomplete. At different times during Earth?s history, some regions experienced sediment deposition, which buries and therefore heats up rocks, while other regions experienced erosion, which both removes portions of the rock record and cools off the rocks that persist by bringing them closer to Earth?s surface. This study will use the geochemical signatures of rock heating and cooling that occurs during deposition and erosion to understand the geologic histories of areas where no sedimentary rocks remain. Specifically, the study will investigate the ancient record of supercontinent breakup, a process that drives changes in sea level, global climate, and topography. This project will provide support for three early-career researchers at different universities, including two women, and build new relationships among the collaborating research groups. Three graduate and nine undergraduate students from different universities will be engaged in collaborative, hypothesis-driven research and learn a range of field, laboratory, and science communication methods. The researchers will also collaborate with the Idaho Museum of Natural History to create a mobile museum exhibit that will highlight the ancient history of the charismatic mountain ranges in the study area and visit museums that serve rural communities in the Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Unconformities, which are abundant in the rock record, are traditionally viewed as unfillable gaps in the rock record of Earth?s history. However, the thermal imprint of sedimentary cover on the basement rocks that underlie many unconformities provides a rich archive of the otherwise inaccessible parts of a continent?s tectonic history. This record is now accessible due to recent conceptual and analytical advances in low-temperature thermochronology. The primary objective of this study is to contribute to these advances by targeting a critical gap in knowledge about Laurentian tectonics, the breakup of supercontinent Rodinia, while establishing an approach to deep-time thermochronology that can document Precambrian tectonic activity in regions that also experienced significant Phanerozoic mountain building. This study will sample along a 700-kilometer-long segment of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, targeting basement rocks directly below the Great Unconformity and using four chronometers to produce holistic tectonothermal histories to fill a billion-year gap in the rock record. This study will demonstrate how deep time thermochronology can provide a new perspective on the geometry and tectonic evolution of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, where much or all of the sedimentary record of Neoproterozoic tectonism is missing. This capability will be tested by (1) establishing a clear link between extant Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks and Neoproterozoic tectonothermal events in the Uinta Mountains, (2) documenting the Proterozoic thermal histories of basement blocks with no overlying Neoproterozoic strata in the Teton Range and southwestern Montana, and (3) quantifying intra-mountain range variability of Proterozoic thermal histories to evaluate the sampling spatial resolution necessary for extracting meaningful tectonic information from the deep-time thermochronologic record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research focuses on a class of proteins which are expressed in strikingly cell-type specific patterns, the intermediate filament (IF) proteins. The project focuses on neurons in the brain which are known to switch IF subtype as they develop their mature shape, including extending long axons to the correct location in the brain. The research aims to determine why neurons switch from one IF subtype to another as they grow. The project will also broaden the impact by contributing to desired societal outcomes: 1) broadening education in STEM fields to support a better informed and more scientifically literate public, and 2) increasing the diversity and inclusivity of the STEM workforce. Especially, the lab aims for full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM at all levels. The project funds research experiences for undergraduates (REU) for one underrepresented minority student during each summer. The REU funded by this project provides hands-on experience in laboratory research by investigating the roles of diverse intermediate filaments in growing axons. In addition, the selected REU student will participate in the institutionally established SRIP (summer research internship program) at the University of Virginia which provides professional skill training and guidance for pursuing a career in STEM in individual and group settings. SRIP has a history of successfully placing participating undergraduate researchers into STEM careers.<br/><br/>This project seeks to discover how developmental IF subtype switching from nestin to neurofilaments in neurons affects signaling to the microtubule cytoskeleton to regulate growth cone structure and motility.

It does so by binding the kinase Cdk5 and its substrate, the microtubule associated protein DCX, thereby increasing DCX phosphorylation. As neurons mature, they switch IF subtype from nestin to neurofilaments, which bind DCX but not Cdk5. The project will test the novel hypothesis that neuronal IFs regulate microtubule dynamics and bundling in axonal growth cones via DCX downstream of Sema3a signaling. Aim 1 will discover how experimental IF switching affects axonal microtubules and growth cone behavior. Aim 2 will discover how experimental IF switching affects Sema3a responses in cortical neurons. The project will use state-of-the-art imaging approaches in cultured cortical neurons in combination with downregulation and overexpression of different IF subtypes to uncover the mechanisms by which different IF subtypes modulate microtubule dynamics in growth cones during axon outgrowth.  Responsiveness to extracellular cues by growth cones during development is influenced not only by the cue available, the receptors expressed on the surface, the intracellular substrates present, but also by the IF subtypes expressed. The PI proposes that neuronal IF subtypes can act as either amplifiers or dampeners of ubiquitous kinase cascades to provide local and cell-type specific regulation of effector responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While migration as a livelihood diversification strategy can be an effective response to economic precarity, labor migration and remittance is usually a temporary measure. Upon returning home, they not only have to find alternative sources of livelihood but assimilate to new local realities and cultural patterns. This project builds a framework to understand the types of livelihood capital available to migrants once they return home, and how this capital interacts with community standards of success circulating in their respective social networks. It responds to community needs and was initiated at the local level, by community stakeholders. However, as return migration is a global issue, this project incorporates a research approach to make its findings generalizable and can be expanded to examine return migration and reintegration in other contexts for cross-cultural comparisons. Findings have the potential to inform policy, along with the design and implementation of reintegration support programs for returnees. <br/><br/>The project aims to obtain an understanding of success as defined by the local community and assess how non-migrants and migrant returnees align with these local definitions, through successive free-listing, semi-structured interviews, and cultural consonance. It will then identify livelihood outcomes among non-migrants and migrant returnees and collect information on sustainable livelihood capitals that individuals have acquired through their respective networks using a life history calendar and semi-structured interviews to guide network data collection. Combining qualitative methods and data with quantitative network measures will contribute to methodological discussions of network analysis, specifically ego networks, within anthropology. The project brings new insights into the discipline by adding a layered and interdisciplinary approach to anthropological theories at the intersection of culture, migration, and network studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The acquisition of specific algorithmic skills such as counting, small number addition, and fractional reasoning have been intensely studied as cognitive achievements in their own right. However, despite the key role that algorithms play in early mathematics, very little is known about algorithmic cognition itself. It is not known, for example, how children generally discover, remember, and reason about algorithms. This project aims to advance our understanding of algorithmic cognition, particularly with respect to early mathematics. That said, algorithmic abilities are not limited to mathematics; algorithmic thinking is ubiquitous in other domains like music, language, motor development, and reasoning. Algorithmic abilities are thus likely to be part of humans' most general learning repertoire. In creating a formal account of children's algorithmic capacities, the research will advance understanding of cognitive development generally, while illuminating cognitive mechanisms at play in much of STEM learning more specifically. A formalized understanding of children's algorithmic cognition will provide a theoretical foundation for learning interventions targeting these systems. It will directly reveal specific representations and algorithmic learning mechanisms as key targets for intervention in early mathematical development. Experimental data and modeling toolkits will be packaged for public use to encourage additional analysis and minimize duplicated effort within the field.<br/><br/>The project will combine computational methods and behavioral experiments with two- to-eight-year-olds to understand the development of algorithmic thinking and its relation to mathematical thinking. It will specifically focus on the long-standing question about how young children come to master counting and understand cardinality. These early numerical skills are foundational for later success in early math, yet the field has not reliably been able to identify the core cognitive precursors of such skills. The researchers hypothesize bidirectional influences between algorithmic and counting skills; that improvement in children's algorithmic skills will immediately precede and thus support learning to count, but that counting leads to revisions of those algorithms. The experiments will target how children reason about the behavior and outcome of algorithms they observe and infer, and how they spontaneously improve algorithms during use. Algorithms interface with memory systems, core cognition, and representations of physical and conceptual objects; they are also executed by human beings whose goals, motivational states, and social contexts vary and must therefore be taken into account. The project will thus be firmly in the spirit of integrative accounts of STEM learning that emphasize the multiple, complex pathways leading to successful acquisition. Recent advances in computational modeling techniques in AI have developed formal models of how algorithms may be acquired in specific domains. This work shows how humans may understand the world by inferring the computational processes that generated the data they observe. Building on these advances, the project will implement a formal theory of early algorithmic cognition which will provide an extensible theoretical foundation for future experimental work. This work will inform theories of the conceptual resources children use to learn mathematics, with implications for the design of targeted interventions.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving similar goals in microscopic environments, such as inside the human vascular system, requires robots with dimensions that are comparable to those of living cells.  However, so-called ?micro-robots? are not autonomous.  Instead, they require on external sensor and controllers to direct their motion and other actions.  The goal of this project is to create autonomous micro-robots that can navigate local variations in their environment with external supervision.  The micro-robots are based on small particles that can be energized by placing them in time-varying magnetic fields.  Once the dynamics of the particles in the magnetic field are understood, the project will design fields that direct particle motion along gradients in surface topography (topotaxis) and fluid velocity (rheotaxis). In addition to providing research training for graduate and undergraduate students, the project will include educational outreach to young women in high school interested in pursuing STEM fields. In partnership with the 'Girls in STEM' summer program at the Courant Institute, summer research projects on micro-robotics will train students on the integration of data, models, and design to advance engineering goals.<br/><br/>Existing micro-robots based on field-driven particles rely on knowledge of the current position and the target destination to control particle motion through fluid environments. These external control strategies often are challenged by limited information (i.e., particle positions are unknown) and global actuation (i.e., particles move in a common field).  This project will use time-varying magnetic fields in three-dimensions to encode the autonomous navigation of multiple particles in response to gradients in the particle environment?particularly, those in topography (topotaxis) and velocity (rheotaxis). Importantly, the field does not instruct particles on where to move but rather on how to respond to local variations in the environment. As a result, the same field can drive multiple particles to move simultaneously in different directions. Building on model predictions, the project aims (1) to demonstrate experimentally the autonomous navigation of magnetic micro-particles across complex topographic landscapes, (2) to design improved driving protocols informed by automated experiments and dynamical models, and (3) to develop rheotactic particles capable of navigating velocity gradients within microfluidic channels. These aims will be achieved through a combination of experiments on magnetic micro-spheres and ellipsoids driven by time-periodic fields and dynamical models based on low Reynolds number hydrodynamics informed and augmented by particle tracking data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The description of plasma physics phenomena, whether observed in a laboratory or in space, must consider the complex interactions between the orbits of charged plasma particles and the electromagnetic fields that control their dynamics. In realistic plasma conditions, however, the underlying plasma equations are often too complex to be solved, even with the help of the most powerful computers available. The complexity of the plasma physics description can be simplified by the adoption of reduced plasma models, which are faithful to the exact plasma dynamics only if their exact conservation properties are preserved from the original plasma equations. A major outcome of this project is the derivation of new theoretical structures for a variety of reduced plasma models with exact conservation properties that allow for the simultaneous treatment of particles and fields under general plasma conditions. The simultaneous treatment of particles and fields within a reduced plasma model can yield significant increases in the power and speed of new numerical algorithms developed for these reduced plasma models. These new numerical algorithms, in turn, will enable the study of the complex dynamics of laboratory and space magnetized plasmas over longer time scales and under more realistic conditions. <br/><br/>The existence of Hamiltonian and dissipative bracket structures for plasma kinetic models have led to the emergence of novel structure-preserving computational algorithms in the past ten years. An important new application of these structure-preserving algorithms carried out in this project is concerned with the development of Hamiltonian and dissipative bracket structures for reduced plasma gyrokinetic models. The derivation of a Hamiltonian bracket structure for a given set of gyrokinetic plasma equations, which presents unique challenges in theoretical physics, is a major outcome of this project. The formulation of gyrokinetic plasma models in terms of fields, instead of potentials, will open new frontiers of research in space and astrophysical plasma physics. The gyrokinetic Hamiltonian bracket structure will also allow for the derivation of the dissipative bracket structure of the gyrokinetic Landau collision operator under general magnetic geometries. By construction, the dissipative gyrokinetic bracket structure will have exact conservation properties, which is a crucial requirement to investigate the synergy between collisionless (Hamiltonian) and collisional (dissipative) plasma evolutions over long time scales. The development of advanced Hamiltonian and dissipative structure-preserving algorithms associated with reduced plasma gyrokinetic models will thus provide a set of powerful theoretical and computational tools for investigations of a wider range of research problems associated with the nonlinear turbulent evolution of laboratory, space, and astrophysical magnetized plasmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such outsourcing and benefits lead to complex verification of the fabricated ICs. Additionally, the security threats in terms of reverse engineering the design have surfaced. To address such reverse engineering of ICs, this project proposes insertion of noise in the IC layout that minimizes the probability of success in IC reverse engineering. The insertion of noise must also meet the standard IC design flow requirements and pass the verification and validation.  <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this project integrates the adversarial machine learning with the IC design flow to enable efficient IC design protection despite attacker obtaining the scanning electron microscope (SEM)/layout images of a given IC. In the first phase, the project develops a surrogate machine learning model to detect the gates in SEM images, followed by incubation of novel adversarial perturbations under spatial constraints on the SEM images. The perturbations obtained through the adversarial learning will be evaluated and embedded in some of the available open-source standard cell libraries, guaranteeing compatibility with existing IC design flow tools. <br/><br/>Successful completion of the project will result in a suite of secure IC cell libraries that are compatible with IC design flows. Specifically, this project (i) develops novel IC cell layouts that cannot be identified by an adversary despite obtaining the images through reverse engineering; (ii) introduces novel adversarial perturbation generation under spatial constraints. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, the outcome of the project impacts a broad variety of researchers in the domains of IC design and adversarial machine learning. The development of library cells from this project will be outsourced with relevant licenses to academia and industry. <br/><br/>The project is expected to generated multiple types of data including IC layouts, SEM images, and cell models.

Collagen is organized into fibers of approximately 1 micron in diameter and and in the range of 10-200 microns in length. In normal tissues, the collagen organization is highly regulated with a balance of degradation and synthesis of old and new collagen. However, in many diseases, including all fibroses, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and connective tissue disorders, this regulation fails, and for the purposes of improved diagnostic/prognostic abilities, it is important to visualize and understand these underlying processes. The sizescales are too small for conventional clinical imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), and approaches using microscopes are thus needed to visualize the collagen fibers. This project will develop new and enhanced tools based on the physical process of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), where this method can selectively image collagen fibers with high sensitivity and specificity. While SHG microscopy has been known for some time, the tools developed in this project will greatly enhance the capabilities over state of the art. Validation will be performed by using these new tools to image human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as this disease is characterized by extensive collagen changes and moreover, has a poor prognosis. Despite increased collagen deposition being the clinical hallmark of the disease, the resulting fiber organization changes have not been well explored. These new enhanced SHG microscopic probes could enable better diagnostic and prognostic purposes as well as provide new insight into IPF disease origin and progression and also inform optimal treatment strategies. The new imaging tools can readily be extended for analogous studies in a wide range of diseases characterized by abnormal collagen organization. The trainees on the project will be immersed in a highly interdisciplinary research environment that involves aspects of fibrosis biology, physics, optical engineering, and image analysis engineering. Additionally, the research will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education. <br/><br/>The native extracellular matrix (ECM) in many tissues has complex 3D collagen architecture, where both the structure and composition are altered in many diseases, including all fibroses, epithelial cancers, cardiovascular disease, and connective tissue disorders. Current microscopy and clinical imaging techniques lack either sufficient resolution, specificity, or sensitivity for effective differentiation between normal and these diseased states.  In this project, new Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) instrumentation and imaging tools will be developed in the form of both excitation and emission tomographies to afford better characterization of 3D collagen structure in tissues.  The excitation tomographic approach is critical as it is necessary to acquire the true 3D collagen fiber architecture which is not possible by other means due to constraints of the electric dipole interaction. Here, the acquisition speed will be improved through the implementation of multifocal excitation through the use of a diffractive optical element. Additionally, by drawing upon principles of Fourier Ptychography Microscopy, 3D super-resolution SHG will be attainable for the first time. This implementation will be coupled with SHG polarization analysis to determine collagen macro/supramolecular structural aspects. The SHG emission tomographic instrument combined with the accompanying theoretical phase-matching treatment will be the first microscope approach that can provide quantitative sub-resolution fibril size and packing structural information. In contrast, this has historically has been only afforded by electron microscopy. The SHG emission tomographic approach has higher throughput (numbers and volume) than TEM and does not require the complicated sample preparation needed by TEM. Validation will be performed by using these new tomographic tools to image human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a serious lung disease that is characterized by extensive collagen remodeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While at least ten plant families produce methyl anthranilate, all plants synthesize the precursor, anthranilate, as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp), which is essential for plant growth and development. The goal of this research is to understand how plants regulate anthranilate metabolism at the interface between amino acid synthesis and defense metabolism. Since methyl anthranilate is used commercially as a grape flavoring agent in the food and beverage industry and as an anti-avian spray for fields and crops, knowledge gained from these experiments may have implications in biotechnology and agriculture. In addition to training diverse undergraduates in protein biochemistry, structural biology, systems biology, and plant genetics at a primarily undergraduate institution, this project will be used to develop a laboratory kit for elementary and middle school students in rural counties in Massachusetts and Vermont to investigate the importance of plant chemicals in defense against herbivores.<br/><br/><br/>Plant chemical defenses are typically specialized metabolites that are synthesized from primary metabolites, like amino acids, or intermediates in primary metabolic pathways. Despite the fundamental role of amino acid biosynthesis in plant defense, the early steps of the Trp biosynthetic pathway remain to be biochemically characterized outside of microorganisms. The Trp pathway starts by forming anthranilate, which is then conjugated to a phosphoribosyl sugar using a transferase (PAT1). Some plants siphon anthranilate away from the Trp pathway by methylating it, forming the volatile O-methyl anthranilate, while the Citrus family generates N-methyl anthranilate as a precursor to toxic acridone alkaloids. The goals of this research are to identify the molecular mechanisms governing anthranilate allocation to Trp versus methyl anthranilate biosynthesis and to trace the evolution of pathway regulation. This project will take advantage of the wealth of available plant genome sequence data and use integrative approaches to investigate anthranilate-using enzymes. Aim 1 will identify the molecular determinants and evolution of PAT1 regulation using mutagenesis, activity assays, and X-ray crystallography. Aim 2 will trace the convergent evolution of anthranilate O- and N-methyltransferases using a structure-guided phylogenetic approach coupled with ex vivo metabolomics assays. Aim 3 will further our understanding of anthranilate modulation using a systems-level approach to investigate phenotypic, metabolic, and gene expression changes in planta. This study will shine new light on the regulatory mechanisms of a fundamental amino acid biosynthetic pathway, as well as aid in our understanding of the evolution of convergent specialized metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many industries discharge increasing amounts of toxic heavy and valuable metals into different complex water sources. These metals of interest tend to be at trace amounts in water mixtures containing high concentrations of inorganic and organic interferents. It is extremely difficult to extract and concentrate such species in these conditions. This project employs novel hybrid materials to selectively and rapidly extract different toxic, rare and/or valuable metal species at trace concentrations from water in a high-capacity, rapid, cost-effective process. These new materials could impact mining of valuable metals like gold, generating new sustainable supply sources. <br/><br/>The proposed project is to implement a hybrid nano-porous material into filter devices and evaluate its gold extracting performance under a continuous flow operation typically seen in industry. Although batch adsorption experiments can provide information to initially assess adsorbents, continuous fixed-bed adsorption experiments must be conducted to obtain other crucial information such as breakthrough time, length of mass transfer zone and maximum capacity of the column under those continuous dynamic conditions. Currently, the hybrid materials are synthesized as nanoparticles (between 250 nm and 500 nm), too small to be implemented in a traditional filter device so that the materials must be optimally shaped and structured first to prevent pressure drops and loss of materials in the continuous flow operation. Next, continuous flow experiments will be conducted to study parameters such as column bed length, column bed diameter, adsorbent mass, flow rate and analyte concentration.

Insects, in particular, have repeatedly formed symbioses with microbes for metabolism, nutrition, and protection. Insect immune systems are tasked with the challenge of controlling and regulating beneficial microbes while combating often closely-related pathogenic microbes. A critical unanswered question is whether the insect immune system is a key mediator of both symbionts and pathogens across different host species. This project will combine cutting edge genomics with experimental manipulations that will link immune responses with symbiont associations across diverse host species. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how immune systems interact with symbionts is not only critical for understanding the evolution of host-associated microbiomes, it also has relevance to the invertebrate pests that vector devastating diseases of crops, livestock, and humans. In addition, there are research opportunities available for undergraduate students to train the next generation of STEM researchers.<br/><br/>This project will use aphids as a model system and involves research at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the Queen Mary University of London. Aphids are uniquely suited for this work because they have strong non-random associations with microbial symbionts: a symbiont species may be common in one aphid species, yet rarely found in a close relative. This suggests a dynamic interplay between host and microbe that can drive symbiont spread or loss over relatively short evolutionary timescales. Preliminary data has shown that hosting certain symbionts leads to a sharp decrease in the expression of key immune genes in aphids. This suggests host immunity is of central importance to the evolution of symbiotic relationships. The primary objective of this project is to use transcriptome sequencing and immune assays to test the hypothesis that host immune suppression is a key mechanism explaining the distribution of symbiotic microbes across aphid species. A secondary objective is to determine whether there is a trade-off in the ability to harbor symbionts and resist pathogens across species. Genomes of virulent and non-virulent symbiont strains will also be compared using a novel symbiont culturing technology to identify genetic features that underlie pathogenicity in symbiotic microbes. Together, this cross-species approach will transform our understanding of how host immunity moderates relationships with symbiotic microbes. This project will thus provide key insight into how invertebrates form and maintain relationships with microbes that can drive rapid adaptive evolution in species of central importance to food security and health.

The polymer chain fragments produced by this thermal decomposition process will be used to synthesize recyclable polyesters, which in turn are expected to contribute to a circular economy, an economic system that reduces waste and avoids excessive use of resources. Polymer synthesis, materials fabrication, and multiscale modeling will be integrated in this project. The project is expected to establish guidelines for efficient design of thermoplastic materials; the ability to manufacture these materials could potentially open a novel direction in large-scale applications of recyclable components employed in the household, construction, automotive, and other sectors of the U.S. economy. The project will offer ample research and educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and local high school students. Students working on this project will gain knowledge of fundamental concepts and an understanding of current challenges in materials science and sustainability. This multidisciplinary project is expected to stimulate the undergraduate and K-12 students? interest and increase public awareness in STEM fields via gaining knowledge of the state-of-the-art polymer recycling/upcycling technologies. A strong emphasis will be placed on actively recruiting students with underrepresented backgrounds. Some of the outcomes of the research and relevant educational materials will be made available to the broad scientific community via a science and engineering gateway, nanoHUB, which is a part of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The objective of this research program is to develop a manufacturing strategy that enables microwave-triggered chemical upcycling of polyolefinic materials after their end-of-life. The design of polyolefinic materials (POMs) with properties of conventional polyolefins but capable of controlled deconstruction into macromolecular chain fragments with well-defined molecular weight distribution will be targeted. Functionalized nanosheets dispersed within the POMs will localize heating and trigger fragmentation upon application of short microwave pulses. Macromolecular chain fragments will be further used to synthesize recyclable semicrystalline polyesters (RPEs). Furthermore, cyclic depolymerization and repolymerization of these semicrystalline polyesters will be demonstrated. Experimental studies and computational modeling will be iteratively integrated. A multiscale model integrating coarse-grained (energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics) and continuum approaches will be developed. Model parameters will be based on the experimental data, and model predictions will be validated with experiments. Modeling predictions will be used to understand and optimize the fragmentation process and RPE synthesis and depolymerization to achieve a targeted molecular weight distribution of chain fragments and to optimize depolymerization and repolymerization yield for the recyclable semicrystalline polyesters. The designed polyolefinic microwave-triggered fragmentation functionality will be built-in during fabrication without compromising the mechanical properties of the materials. The proposed research directly addresses current challenges by focusing on developing efficient chemical processes, improving environmental sustainability, designing tailor-made materials, and developing computer simulation approaches aiding composite material synthesis and processing. The multiscale modeling framework developed herein will account for the reactions, heat transfer, and diffusion of all the species including chain fragments, macroradicals, and low molecular weight reagents. This model, in conjunction with experimental validation, will allow one to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamic processes taking place during controlled fragmentation and subsequent depolymerization/repolymerization cycles. The realization of the proposed program is anticipated to have a transformative impact on development of deconstructable-on-demand thermoplastics, with properties and processability of currently employed materials. Polyolefinic materials produced from plastic waste are envisioned to become an essential part of the circular economy. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in model and code development and in materials synthesis, fabrication, and characterization. Importantly, the students focusing on materials modeling and the students conducting experiments will interact closely within this project, so that all the students involved will gain a valuable collaborative experience and a broader perspective on their projects.

Speeding up this charge transport is critical for biological performance and efficiency. How proteins achieve sufficiently fast electron transport is still puzzling. Matyushov and his research group will perform high performance computer simulations and modeling to develop understanding of high efficiency of charge transport in proteins. A new and surprising development in this field is the realization that proteins are also high-efficiency conductors, despite long-held view of these materials as insulators.

A new theory recently developed in his group predicts high sensitivity of proteins in solution to electric field gradients, which offers new technologies for protein separation in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. The results of this work will be available to the community in the form of predictive computational algorithms to calculate conductivity of proteins and their sensitivity to the electric field in microfluidic devices.

Chronic heart failure is characterized by cardiac muscle weakening, which reduces the heart?s ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. To compensate, the nervous system diverts blood volume from the abdominal vasculature to help restore blood flow. While this mechanism is safely activated during normal periods of exercise in patients with heart failure, this mechanism over-stresses both the heart and lungs, causing fluid accumulation in the lungs. This fluid makes it difficult to breathe or carry out basic activities of daily living, forcing patients to the hospital multiple times each year. Current medications afford some clinical benefit but, in many cases, are ineffective at relieving symptoms or reducing hospital admissions. Heart failure remains a major clinical and economic burden with limited treatment options. The proposed technology leverages this neuro-cardiac mechanism, removing the fluid from the heart and lungs, and restoring it to a safer place ? the abdominal capacitance vessels. This procedure may enable improved patient symptoms, reduced hospitalizations, and potentially alter the course of heart disease. By performing targeted ablation, the aim is to break the cycle of rehospitalizations for patients with heart failure.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to perform an endovascular ablation that directs energy to tissues previously accessible only by invasive surgery for the interventionalist physician. Radiofrequency ablation has been employed to treat disease by coagulating tissues, but there remain concerns surrounding accuracy, procedure success, and collateral damage to surrounding tissues. The proposed technology relies on two components: 1) an electro-stimulation feature that locates a target nerve and confirms procedure completion and 2) a vein-puncture ablation probe that improves accuracy, reduces collateral damage, and reduces procedure times compared to conventional ablation catheters.  The proposed device offers a solution for neuromodulation and nerve ablation that specifically targets nerves and avoids collateral damage.  In addition, this minimally invasive device targets a nerve located in the thoracic cavity that is not near the heart. Therefore, cardiologists may consider this a low-risk procedure that may be performed in an outpatient setting.  By targeting the highest risk heart disease patients, it may be possible to directly address the societal needs of patients and the healthcare system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a large group of bacteria, the Gram-negatives, the cell envelope is composed of two membranes with a rigid cell wall sandwiched between. The envelope is a selectively permeable barrier allowing the uptake of important nutrients from the outside, expulsion of toxic wastes from the inside, and is a first line of defense against environmental stress. Nearly 30% of the cell's proteins are embedded in the envelope where they perform critical and diverse functions including in construction of the envelope and maintenance of its integrity. Among these, lipoproteins are an important and abundant class of proteins that bear characteristic fatty acid chains which anchor them to the cell's membranes. The fatty acid addition takes place on the membrane itself, and this necessitates the tight coordination of lipoprotein modification with membrane homeostasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate this coupling. This project characterizes the means by which bacteria control lipoprotein modification when the cell envelope is subject to environmental or mutational stresses. The work will likely be applicable to other Gram-negative bacteria which play important pathological and non-pathological roles in virtually all environments on the planet.   To achieve its goals, this project will use a combination of genetics, biochemical and cell biological methodologies thereby providing multidisciplinary and multidimensional training for undergraduate and graduate students at the City College of New York (CCNY). An inquiry-based laboratory module that is closely aligned with the research goals of this proposal will be incorporated into an undergraduate microbiology course. <br/><br/>In Gram-negative bacteria, the post-translation modification of lipoproteins with fatty acyl chains derived from membrane phospholipids occurs at the inner membrane. Some of these mature lipoproteins are retained at the inner membrane while most are localized to the outer membrane. Their processing and functions are not fully understood. Further, if and how cells regulate lipoprotein modification, particularly when membrane homeostasis is altered under envelope stress, is unclear. This project aims to address this question by investigating specific molecular mechanisms that serve to maintain the fidelity of lipoprotein maturation in response to physicochemical alterations in membrane properties resulting from environmental or mutational stress. Specific experiments will probe the synthetic relationship between a set of conserved bacterial genes in whose absence lipoprotein maturation is defective. Mutations within this set leads to altered lipoprotein localization, formation of aberrant links of the inner membrane with the cell wall, cytoplasmic shrinkage, culminating in cell death. The proposed experiments are based on initial findings that support the presence of an essential molecular safety mechanism to maintain the fitness of this process in response to alterations in membrane lipid composition/balance. Overall, it is expected that this project will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of bacterial cell envelope integrity under stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such outsourcing and benefits lead to complex verification of the fabricated ICs. Additionally, the security threats in terms of reverse engineering the design have surfaced. To address such reverse engineering of ICs, this project proposes insertion of noise in the IC layout that minimizes the probability of success in IC reverse engineering. The insertion of noise must also meet the standard IC design flow requirements and pass the verification and validation.  <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this project integrates the adversarial machine learning with the IC design flow to enable efficient IC design protection despite attacker obtaining the scanning electron microscope (SEM)/layout images of a given IC. In the first phase, the project develops a surrogate machine learning model to detect the gates in SEM images, followed by incubation of novel adversarial perturbations under spatial constraints on the SEM images. The perturbations obtained through the adversarial learning will be evaluated and embedded in some of the available open-source standard cell libraries, guaranteeing compatibility with existing IC design flow tools. <br/><br/>Successful completion of the project will result in a suite of secure IC cell libraries that are compatible with IC design flows. Specifically, this project (i) develops novel IC cell layouts that cannot be identified by an adversary despite obtaining the images through reverse engineering; (ii) introduces novel adversarial perturbation generation under spatial constraints. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, the outcome of the project impacts a broad variety of researchers in the domains of IC design and adversarial machine learning. The development of library cells from this project will be outsourced with relevant licenses to academia and industry. <br/><br/>The project is expected to generated multiple types of data including IC layouts, SEM images, and cell models.

There is an increased demand for fast, continuous environmental surveillance in city sewers. These confined spaces occupy a large portion of a city's infrastructure. However, today's conventional robots, including ground and aerial systems, cannot operate in a vast majority of sewers. Sewer networks present a veritable maze of pipes, chambers, and utility holes that pose tremendous challenges for robot locomotion control and navigation. Therefore, human operators still inspect these dangerous spaces. In addition to carrying many risks for humans, manned operations in these environments are costly and slow. This grant?s research will contribute to the design of aerial, bat-inspired robots that can operate in sewers, by mimicking bat aerial locomotion principles in caves. The results from this research will greatly benefit the society. Especially during a pandemic, the continuous and automated monitoring of a city?s aging sewer systems using these bat-inspired drones can play a vital role in saving human lives. For instance, SARS-CoVs can be present in wastewater for several days, and its early detection in sewers in 2019 could have allowed for increased preparedness in combating the current pandemic. This project trains new generation scientists, engineers, and technologists with interdisciplinary skills, providing future professionals with vertically integrated, use-inspired experiential learning activities.<br/><br/>Today's rotary-wing drones are better solutions for inspection and monitoring city infrastructure than ground robots because they are scalable, inexpensive, easy to deploy, and possess fast mobility. However, these systems cannot fly inside tight areas such as tunnels with small cross-sections because they rely on powerful and continuous air jets. So far, the confined space applications of these drones include only flying inside buildings or very spacious confined environments, which are not comparable to the application of aerial robots in sewers. This research will allow drones to complete fully autonomous flights inside tight spaces such as sewer galleries. The research team will (i) use an integrated mechanical intelligence and control framework to design drones with dynamically versatile body conformations and significant computational complexity to prevent creation of powerful air jets, (ii) design an integrated model-based and data-driven flight control framework that captures not only the model uncertainty but also the environmental aerodynamic effects that arise due to flight in tunnels, and (iii) develop a novel navigation framework that relies on high-level abstract guidance extracted from sewer schematic diagrams, enabling robust navigation in unmapped environments.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid advances in molecular techniques have facilitated widespread taxonomic characterization of microbial communities. Current research is quickly moving beyond just characterizing diversity (who is there?), towards a focus on linking individual species with their functional properties (what do they do?). However, the study of some microbial communities remain relatively unexplored with respect to diversity or function. This is particularly true for benthic biofilms (i.e., assemblage of algae, bacteria, and fungi) in freshwater ecosystems. The overarching goal of this research is to use molecular techniques to bridge the gap between microbial community composition and functioning within natural environments. Findings from this research will make significant contributions to an understanding of, and ability to, link microbial diversity with ecosystem function. By providing data from natural microbial communities to publically available repositories, this project will facilitate improved taxonomic resolution and genomic library construction. These data may also be useful beyond their ecological application given that identification of novel microbial associations in natural environments could facilitate the design of synthetic microbial communities as a tool for industrial cultivation and biotechnology. In addition to charting new conceptual ground in molecular ecology, this project will provide research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups. <br/><br/>Many ecosystem processes (e.g., carbon cycling) are mediated by microorganisms and understanding how microbial functions scale up to the ecosystem level is an important goal in ecology. Boreal peatlands provide a model ecosystem to examine relationships between microbial structure and function owing to their role in global carbon storage. In this project, researchers will use molecular techniques to examine both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic diversity of the biofilm microbiome and identify functional traits along a hydrologic gradient and relate changes in microbiome structure and function to peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Biofilm composition and metabolism are strongly influenced by differences in hydrologically mediated environmental conditions with consequences for net CO2 emissions. Conditions that promote a higher proportion of autotrophic (algae) biofilm results in greater CO2 uptake from the atmosphere, whereas a biofilm dominated by heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) promotes greater CO2 emissions. The composition of autotrophic and heterotrophic components of the biofilm are intricately linked and perturbations to one portion of the biofilm community can cascade through the rest. Therefore, it is anticipated that changes in gene expression that control metabolic functions within the autotrophic component of the biofilm will be reflected in the make-up and functioning of the heterotrophic component of the biofilm and vice versa. This project is expected to reveal the influence of environmental conditions on gene expression within the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of the biofilm. Further, this research is likely to facilitate the discovery of correlated patterns of abundance between certain eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes, and link trait-mediated metabolic functions at the community level. Using metagenomic approaches to evaluate how abiotic and biotic interactions shape microbial communities and microbial-mediated biogeochemical processes addresses a critical knowledge gap in the field of aquatic microbiology and will provide a better understanding of how aquatic microbes participate in biogeochemical cycling within peatlands. Methodological procedures will be integrated into college curriculum, providing opportunities for a diversity of students to gain exposure to ecological molecular techniques and applications that will prepare them for the increasing use of applied microbiology in industry, environmental monitoring, and management careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of GR has made tremendous progress in understanding the fundamental aspects of space and time. The theory has been successful in making predictions for the evolution of the universe and various astrophysical phenomena. However it is well-known that GR is incomplete. It loses its capability of making predictions in an extremely strong gravitational field, e.g. inside a black hole, or at the very early stage of universe near the big bang. One of the most fundamental open questions in physics is how to complete GR in order to predict physics in an extremely strong gravitational field. The complete theory of gravity that we are searching for is called ""Quantum Gravity"". The theory of Quantum Gravity should play a crucial role in describing the physics inside a black hole and helping us to understand the early universe near the big bang. Eventually Quantum Gravity will lead us to a revolutionary understanding of space and time, and advance our research of fundamental physics and applications in all aspects. This award supports the development of a candidate Quantum Gravity theory known as ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" (LQG). This project contains an education plan as part of the broader impact and supports education in physics at both levels of the university and the general public.<br/><br/>LQG is a theory featured with the background independence and non-perturbative quantization of spacetime structure. This project focuses on developing the theory of LQG with cosmological constant in four dimensions, in particular the spinfoam formulation of theory.

Specifically, this project will track the formation of an imperial heartland in a region inhabited by politically fragmented agropastoral groups. Throughout history, state societies have transformed landscapes to naturalize their authority and discredit indigenous inhabitants by alleging mismanagement of natural resources and land. Although modern nation-states have established borders, disputed land claims still trigger conflict in many world regions and marginalized populations fight for sovereignty and territorial integrity by contesting state authority. This project looks at how states claim occupied territories and support expansion by transforming existing built environments and evaluates the efficacy of such endeavors over the long term. Archaeology is an excellent tool to track the successes and failures of political projects across expansive temporal and spatial scales. Using archaeological methods, this research will evaluate strategies of political sovereignty and identify contradictions that threaten the longevity of state societies, as manifested in the built environment. This project will be conducted in close collaboration with early-career researchers in Peru, providing training and capacity-building opportunities. In addition to forming the basis of dissertation research, two local archaeology students will conduct their thesis research in tandem with the project for the completion of their degrees.<br/><br/>The research team will analyze construction and landscape modification practices to understand how the Inkas established and managed their imperial heartland. Taking a long-term view over roughly half a millennium sheds light on the changing geopolitical conditions that shaped this region and the legacies of non-state political units. Ethnically diverse agropastoral groups settled in the Sacred Valley and began to build hilltop villages, agricultural terraces, and above-ground tombs across this mountainous landscape. Centuries later the Inka ethnic group had expanded political influence into the valley; their increasing presence was materialized in irrigated agricultural lands along the valley floor and administrative outposts in local (non-Inka) territories. By the Spanish invasion the valley had become foundational in supporting the Inkas? sovereign ideology and political economy, which operated through estate systems and intensive landscape engineering projects. How did the Inkas? strategies of expansion respond to the existing built environment? And how did the Inkas? interventions impact local inhabitants and landscapes? This research will respond to these questions by defining the practices that shaped this landscape during the late pre-Hispanic period, including the standardization of architecture, centralization of agricultural systems, and diversity in mortuary practices. The contributions of this project include the development of an innovative research methodology that quantitatively measures variation in construction techniques to compare the sociopolitical context of production at local and regional scales. The data produced by this study can be compared with global cases to better understand human behavior including landscape modification practices and territoriality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team is collaborating closely with the Qawalangin Tribe of Unalaska and City of Unalaska through a participatory research approach to understand the risks of human exposure to POPs on Unalaska Island. The community-driven co-production approach enables the continuation of culturally important subsistence lifestyles, trains residents for research and management techniques, and fosters proactive and sustainable public health risk management.

This research aims to understand the critical mechanisms that determine the location, strength, evolution, and characteristics of Arctic cyclones (ACs) and tropopause polar vortices (TPVs), and their potential for influencing sea ice break-up and decline. TPVs are an important precursor to the development and evolution of ACs and are also one of the longest-lived features in the Earth?s lower atmosphere. Yet their locations in data-sparse regions of the Arctic and their relatively small spatial scale make it difficult to observe and understand their detailed structure and resulting impacts on the Earth?s climate. Fundamental differences exist between the dynamics of cyclones in middle latitudes and the Arctic. For example, atmospheric vortices rather than waves play a more significant role in cyclone lifecycles and radiative processes have increased importance in maintaining and strengthening TPVs. Thus, the correct treatment of cloud and radiative processes in models is likely critical to accurately defining the structure and intensity of TPVs and ACs. The data needed to expand knowledge of these Arctic processes is currently limited due to the relatively sparse Arctic conventional observing network and the difficulties in obtaining high-quality measurements of Arctic clouds and moisture from satellite-based remote sensing. This project will also assess where new data are needed.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the coupling of TPVs and ACs with the underlying sea surface and sea ice during the summer and advance our knowledge of how this coupling can lead to rapid sea ice loss. Researchers will test the hypothesis that an accurate representation of the vertical distribution of water vapor is necessary to represent the radiative heating required to evolve and intensify TPVs and ACs. The researchers will combine observations with state-of-the-art high-resolution numerical weather models and fully-coupled Earth-System models through coupled ensemble data assimilation for multi-scale studies. The team will perform observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) as well as observing system experiments (OSEs) using atmospheric data from an aircraft field campaign and routinely available satellite and atmospheric data to estimate the observation impacts in a variety of well-defined scenarios. Knowledge gained from detailed simulations and observations of the processes that cause error growth will lead to improvements in weather and climate prediction by improving the representation of these processes in Earth-system numerical models across a wide range of scales, which is a main priority in the 2022-2026 Arctic Research Plan by The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC).

Unfortunately, such composition is insecure and the source of countless attacks in the wild. Software sandboxing promises to confine third-party code and ensure that bugs in third-party code cannot compromise the whole system. However, existing sandboxing frameworks only reason about code running in the sandbox and thus their security guarantees don't extend to most real programs, which ultimately need to exit the sandbox to communicate with the outside world. This project will develop foundations, techniques, and frameworks for building end-to-end secure sandboxing systems that provide formal security guarantees even across the sandbox boundary. If successful, this project will let developers safely use and benefit from open source and third-party code, without needing to absorb all the risk. This will, in turn, address many of the security problems that arise when building large software systems and the ensuing financial and social costs associated with cyberattacks.<br/><br/><br/>The investigators will: (1) design novel type systems that will allow developers to explicitly encode sandbox boundary invariants and automatically generate boundary code that is secure by construction; (2) develop formal foundations for sandbox context-switching to characterize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements of secure context-switching; and (3) develop a formal semantics for the interface between the sandbox runtime and the key operating system abstractions that are expose to sandboxed programs to communicate and perform I/O. Together, these formal foundations will be used to synthesize a verified-secure runtime system and portable system interface, which will allow sandboxed modules to safely interact with each other, the application, and operating system services. The project will yield new innovations in the design, implementation, and verification of secure sandboxing frameworks, and lead to new techniques and tools that will empower developers to build large-scale systems that are secure by construction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Heat tolerance varies among species, but little is understood about the genetic differences that make some animals and plants more heat tolerant than others.  This research will use the small marine crustacean, Tigriopus californicus, as an experimental model to investigate the genetic changes lead to increased heat tolerance.  The researchers will conduct a series of evolution experiments, where they will artificially select for increased heat tolerance in Tigriopus in the laboratory.  At the end of the experiments they will sequence the genomes of the experimental populations to examine which genetic changes led to greater heat tolerance. Then they will compare these genetic changes to differences among northern and southern populations of Tigriopus, which naturally differ in their heat tolerance, to test whether the same changes are responsible for increased heat tolerance in the lab and in nature.  This research will contribute a greater understanding of why some species are more heat tolerant than others, leading to an improved ability to predict which species will be more vulnerable to climate change.  An understanding of the genetic changes that lead to greater heat tolerance could also be used in aquaculture and in conservation breeding programs, to identify which strains of a given species are the most likely to be resilient to warming.<br/><br/>Thermal tolerance traits govern the abundance and distribution of organisms across environments and shape organismal responses to climate change. However, mechanisms determining variation in thermal tolerance are poorly understood for most species. The splash pool copepod Tigriopus californicus exhibits divergent thermal tolerance traits across populations, and is easily crossed and reared in the lab. As a result, it is an excellent model for examining mechanisms of temperature adaptation.  The researchers will perform three selection experiments, each targeting a different aspect of thermal performance that differs among Tigriopus populations: (A) upper lethal limits, (B) plasticity of thermal limits, and (C) thermal optima.  They will combine these experiments with physiological measurements, transcriptome profiling, and whole-genome resequencing to identify mechanisms underlying each aspect of thermal adaptation. Finally, they will compare results of laboratory experiments to population resequencing data for two Tigriopus species distributed over parallel temperature gradients in North and South America.   Results of this project  will provide a comprehensive map of the genetic and physiological bases of temperature adaptation in this species, and shed light on key questions, including the role of gene regulation vs. protein coding changes in physiological divergence among populations, the proportion of the genome involved in temperature adaptation, the costs and trade-offs imposed by the evolution of increased thermal breadth, and the repeatability of adaptation across parallel environmental gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by improving the academic preparation of entering engineering students and ultimately increasing the number and diversity of engineering graduates. Students enter community college with varied levels of preparation, particularly in science and mathematics.  The COVID-19 pandemic has likely increased this variability, due to academic interruptions and social isolation. To overcome these challenges, this project intends to develop a two-quarter, integrated learning community to help prepare students to study engineering and to transfer to four-year institutions.  Plans include developing a place-based curriculum that embraces a holistic model for academic preparation. The project will feature cross-disciplinary collaboration of faculty in engineering, math, physics, English and history working together to design, implement, and assess the new curriculum. Once the curriculum is developed, a 24-student cohort will be recruited to complete a two-quarter sequence of three tightly integrated and team-taught courses. Quarter one will combine courses in engineering, pre-calculus, and Pacific Northwest history and culture. Quarter two will combine introductory design and computing, additional pre-calculus, and English composition. The integrated two-quarter experience will blur traditional disciplinary boundaries and incorporate multiple high-impact practices including contextualized mathematics and English, service-learning, and a course-based undergraduate research experience. This approach should improve learning outcomes for participating students compared to the current a la carte model of course offerings, and advance student progress along factors such as intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging that are vital to student success as engineering majors. <br/><br/>The project is intended to: (1) address disparities in community college students? academic, social, and emotional preparation for an engineering major using a holistic approach; (2) accelerate engagement of participating students within existing curriculum, community, and support systems; and (3) increase course success rates, improve program retention, and reduce equity gaps in engineering transfer preparation and associate degree completion. Program outcomes will be assessed using a mixed methods approach consisting of student surveys, focus group interviews, and comparison of outcomes data to demographically matched samples of students simultaneously progressing through the existing early engineering curriculum. In addition, disseminating project results through the engineering education community at regional and national conferences, the project aims to produce modular curriculum products that could be implemented in individual courses.

Plant cells mobilize their highly dynamic subcellular compartments, known as organelles, to fulfill physiological functions in growth and development.  This project will uncover the poorly understood mechanisms by which organelles move and distribute along molecular tracks called actin filaments within plant cells in response to internal and external signals.  The focus will be on peroxisomes and mitochondria, two organelles that are physically and biochemically connected and essential for energy metabolism and survival of plants.  The molecular machinery responsible for the motility and distribution of these two types of organelles will be dissected, using the small mustard plant Arabidopsis.  Knowledge gained will provide fundamental insights into the principles associated with the motility of plant organelles, thereby giving perspectives on how these molecular machineries evolved.  In addition, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in modern biological skills.  Hands-on research experience will be provided to first-year undergraduate students in the classroom with the goal of retaining them in science majors.  Discovery-based summer trainings will be provided to undergraduates in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, physiology and computational biology in order to prepare them for a scientific career or advanced training after graduation.  <br/><br/>Cytoskeleton-dependent active movement and distribution of organelles are fundamentally significant for cell growth, division, and signaling.  However, how organelles recruit cytoskeletal motor proteins for their directional transport along the cytoskeletal tracks is complex and often under debate.  This project focuses on molecular mechanisms underlying the motility and distribution of plant peroxisomes and mitochondria, multifunctional and metabolically linked organelles essential for energy metabolism and plant viability.  An exploratory effort detected directional transport of peroxisomes along actin filaments and discovered candidate proteins functioning at the interface between peroxisomes/mitochondria and the cytoskeleton for organellar motility and distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana.  It is hypothesized that the active long-distance movement of peroxisomes/mitochondria along actin filaments is regulated by organelle-specific receptor/adaptor proteins and GTPases, which recruit the actin-associated Myosin XI motors that energize the motility.  The project includes three aims:  (1) Determining the role of the actin-binding protein Peroxisomal and Mitochondrial Division 1 (PMD1) in mediating the tethering of peroxisomes/mitochondria to the actin filaments; (2) Dissecting the adaptor complex that recruits Myosin XI to the peroxisome by testing the roles of TONSOKU-associated protein 1 (TSA1), the RABE1c GTPase, and the peroxin PEX5; and (3) Dissecting the adaptor complex that recruits Myosin XI to mitochondria by testing the functions of Cardiomyopathy-Associated Protein (CMYA) and the MIRO1 GTPase.  Protein immuno-affinity purification, proteomics, live-cell imaging, genetics and physiological phenotyping will be employed to untangle interactions between peroxisomes/mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton that regulate organelle motility and advance the understanding of the impact of organelle motility on plant fitness.

Hundreds of years later, gravity is still considered to be the most poorly understood force. It cannot be consistently described across different theories in physics, and even its strength is poorly known. The Newtonian constant of gravitation, which quantifies the strength of gravity, is perhaps the most poorly measured fundamental property of the universe. This project seeks to greatly improve our knowledge of this constant with the most significant change in technique since the experiments of Henry Cavendish in 1798, who used a torsion balance for his measurements. The measurement funded by this award may be of value across many areas of physics and astronomy, and the new experimental tools being developed may lead to new instruments for measuring extremely small forces and accelerations for use in studying the earth and for inertial navigation. Further, the attention to detail required in these experiments makes them an exceptional training ground for tomorrow's STEM workers.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a new system for measuring the Newtonian constant of gravitation G, and to make a measurement of G to unprecedented accuracy (10 parts per million or better). The approach leverages a recently-developed optomechanical system: a silica microsphere suspended in a magneto-gravitational trap under ultra-high vacuum. The mechanical oscillation of the microsphere will be used in the time-of-swing method to determine G from the change in oscillation frequency when field masses are brought near the trapped particle. The system has multiple features that make it nearly ideal for precision measurements, including an oscillation frequency that can be made less than 1 Hz, isolation from the surrounding environment, and other degrees of freedom to act as a built-in probe to correct for drifts. The proposed measurement strategy was chosen for its transparency to the scientific community. First, the simplicity of the system makes it simple to understand and analyze. Second, most of the data will be contained in sequences of images which are recorded; there are almost no hidden feedback loops or other difficulties in reanalyzing components. To ensure confidence in the new measurement, all data and analysis code will be stored and made freely available to other researchers in their entirety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet their locations in data-sparse regions of the Arctic and their relatively small spatial scale make it difficult to observe and understand their detailed structure and resulting impacts on the Earth?s climate. Fundamental differences exist between the dynamics of cyclones in middle latitudes and the Arctic. For example, atmospheric vortices rather than waves play a more significant role in cyclone lifecycles and radiative processes have increased importance in maintaining and strengthening TPVs. Thus, the correct treatment of cloud and radiative processes in models is likely critical to accurately defining the structure and intensity of TPVs and ACs. The data needed to expand knowledge of these Arctic processes is currently limited due to the relatively sparse Arctic conventional observing network and the difficulties in obtaining high-quality measurements of Arctic clouds and moisture from satellite-based remote sensing. This project will also assess where new data are needed.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the coupling of TPVs and ACs with the underlying sea surface and sea ice during the summer and advance our knowledge of how this coupling can lead to rapid sea ice loss. Researchers will test the hypothesis that an accurate representation of the vertical distribution of water vapor is necessary to represent the radiative heating required to evolve and intensify TPVs and ACs. The researchers will combine observations with state-of-the-art high-resolution numerical weather models and fully-coupled Earth-System models through coupled ensemble data assimilation for multi-scale studies. The team will perform observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) as well as observing system experiments (OSEs) using atmospheric data from an aircraft field campaign and routinely available satellite and atmospheric data to estimate the observation impacts in a variety of well-defined scenarios. Knowledge gained from detailed simulations and observations of the processes that cause error growth will lead to improvements in weather and climate prediction by improving the representation of these processes in Earth-system numerical models across a wide range of scales, which is a main priority in the 2022-2026 Arctic Research Plan by The Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC). Students at all levels will have an opportunity to work with the data produced in this project, with a focus towards broadening participation from chronically underrepresented groups in STEM fields and in Oklahoma, including students identifying as Native Americans, members of First Nations, Indigenous people, and American Indians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second, the conference furthers geographic science through robust exchanges among scholars, along with presentations and workshops that highlight key contributions to geography and discuss different methodological practices. These objectives are integrated into several conference format innovations that generate new kinds of collaborations and participation. These innovations include holding a hybrid-virtual conference in multiple sites, hosting a flipped conference model with archives, hosting virtual keynote panel discussions, and developing value-added in-person conference activities. These formats enhance accessibility for early-career researchers, graduate students, international scientists, and members of historically excluded groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Society benefits from the inclusion of multiple, even conflicting, perspectives. The knowledge generated from different perspectives has the capacity to enhance geographic science, which in turn enhances and improves research and outreach work with the public. The conference provides a vital space for mentoring and networking across national boundaries and allow international students and scholars the opportunity to benefit from a professional space that has been inaccessible due to financial or travel restrictions, building capacity for geographic research through the support and retention of graduate students and early-career scholars from underrepresented backgrounds. The sharing of pedagogical innovation expands beyond the conference to classrooms throughout the United States and internationally.

How adaptive radiations generate spectacular numbers of species over short time periods is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology.  Adaptive radiations in remote islands are especially fascinating, given that such radiations originate from founder populations with limited genetic variation, which is the raw material for evolution.  Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive radiations on remote islands allows insight into not only the origin of species (and, hence, biodiversity), but also how species will respond to rapid climate change.  This project will uncover the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme water availability (drought and flooding) in Metrosideros, an adaptive radiation of woody species that dominate Hawaii?s forests.  The results will reveal how often recurring adaptation to very wet and very dry environments relies on the recycling of ancient genes present in the founder population versus new genes arising through mutation.  Repeated adaptation through the recycling of ancient genes would help to explain how adaptive radiations occur and would suggest that species are able to adapt to rapid climate change.  In particular, this project will reveal insights into how trees will cope with the increased drought and flooding expected with climate change.  The project will also train one technician, 2 Ph.D. students, and several undergraduates in cutting-edge technologies and analyses, provide bioinformatics training to federal and state agency staff and students, faculty, and staff at two Minority-Serving Institutions, and develop G6-12 curriculum related to plant adaptation and response to climate change.<br/><br/>The proposed research will apply an evolutionary systems biology approach to Hawaii?s landscape-dominant woody genus, Metrosideros, to characterize the genetic basis of local adaptation to water availability across an island adaptive radiation. The project will take advantage of the relatively small genome size and high-quality chromosome-level reference genome; parental, F1, and F2 lines; and population-level resequencing data available for Metrosideros to accomplish 3 aims: Aim 1) contrast seedling physiology and patterns of gene expression between replicate dry- and wet-adapted taxa in response to drought and water-logging, Aim 2) identify phenotypic traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to drought or water-logging and identify QTL that colocalize with differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Aim 3) examine the evolution of the colocalized DEG-QTL regions (and non-intersecting, but significant QTL) across the Hawaiian Metrosideros adaptive radiation to test the prediction that recurring adaptation to parallel environments involves recurring selection on shared genomic regions of predominantly ancestral origin. By investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation across an island adaptive radiation, this project will help to solve the long-standing evolutionary problem of how spectacular phenotypic and ecological diversity can arise from founder populations with limited genetic variation. Specifically, results will reveal the degree to which recurring adaptation to parallel environments draws on the same genomic regions in different taxa and the relative importance of shared ancestral variation, introgression, and de novo mutations for parallel evolution within an isolated radiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Eli will address the GPU and storage needs of computing for research, research training, and education. The proposed hardware is 6 GPU Compute Nodes with 2 Intel 32-Core Xeon Gold CPUs having 16 x 32G DRAM, 4 NVIDIA Tesla A30 GPUs, 1 SATA SSD boot drive (960GB) and 2 NVMe Solid State Drives (4TB each). It also includes a meta data Server, storage server, and NFS node.<br/><br/>This project addresses two areas of improvement in the Oral Roberts University (ORU) Research Computing and Analytics (ORCA) facility, providing GPU resources and adding much needed parallel file system (PFS) resources. These new resources are deployed as a third cluster partition, named Eli, in ORCA?s existing Titan cluster.  Along with Eli?s 100/200Gb HDR InfiniBand fabric, the Eli PFS supports native communication from each of Titan?s other partitions with 100GbE OmniPath and 40GbE QDR InfiniBand. Eli?s GPU nodes has potential to address a local and regional void of GPU capacity for traditional HPC codes (especially VASP and GAMESS) as well as emerging Data Science codes. VASP and GAMESS consume many core hours. The GPUs will accelerate these efforts while freeing previously used resources to other applications. With ORU?s Data Science degree concentrations, nearly half of the new ORU research efforts are Data Science related, driving demand for tools such as TensorFlow and Natural Language Processing tools. Eli?s PFS provides the much-needed capacity and performance to support the existing and emerging science drivers. While serving ORCA?s current users, Eli?s augmentation of Titan provides new researchers additional motivation to embrace HPC/AI methods.

The proposed technology advances techniques in data engineering, machine learning, and visualization, and may enable colleges and universities to leverage their massive student academic and financial records to support students? success in more sophisticated, targeted capacities. The proposed technology may help higher education institutions achieve strategic goals for increasing graduation rates, improving time-to-degree completion, and eliminating equity gaps in graduation outcomes for low-income students. Students using the proposed technology may benefit from insights gained into the runway of eligibility for federal financial aid, allowing students to make more informed and efficient degree planning choices, graduate before exhausting lifetime aid eligibility, and limit their educational expenses and debt by reducing their overall time to degree. More individuals may earn baccalaureate degrees in less time and with less overall expense and student debt, and be ready to contribute better to society.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an intelligent system that incorporates financial, academic, and demographic data to accurately predict whether undergraduates are likely to graduate from 4-year institutions and if they will graduate within four years or more. The proposed technology has been designed to identify students who are at increased risk in terms of their financial health, including students on a trajectory to exhaust lifetime-limited federal financial aid resources before graduating. In addition, the developed scripts for data cleaning and feature engineering may be easily changed to fit a given university?s data models. Undergraduates may be able to use the proposed advanced web and mobile technologies to wisely plan their academic coursework in order to graduate before their financial aid runs out, resulting in improved academic outcomes.

This rapid growth has created a need for trained automotive technicians in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) and Electric Vehicle (EV) platform technologies.  Minnesota State Community and Technical College will meet this need by creating Open Educational Resources (OER) and two new stackable certificates that will enable current students, past graduates, and current industry technicians to advance their knowledge and capabilities to diagnose, service, repair, replace, and maintain these technologies.  The college will create two new academic certificates and recruit current students and recent graduates from the Automotive Technology program. These certificates represent the kind of specialized training that regional employers have been seeking for their technicians.<br/><br/>Minnesota State Community and Technical College will align their current program offerings to address trends in regional training and make them more accessible by creating Open Education Resources.  In partnership with the Midwest Teachers of Technical and Industrial Areas (MTTIA), the team will provide training to secondary and post-secondary instructors in Hybrid and Electric Plug-In Technologies.  The classes that support these new certificates will be developed at Minnesota State Community and Technical College and will be expanded to include Riverland College as a model for widespread dissemination.

Hunt and her research group will analyze the probability for a time-dependent electromagnetic field to induce transitions from the initial quantum state of a molecule to excited states.  The results are expected to have important applications in analyzing energy uptake and energy conversion devices.  The work, heat, power, and efficiency of quantum Otto engines will be analyzed within the new theory developed by the Hunt research group.  This analysis is expected to show that quantum engines can exceed traditional Carnot limits on the conversion of heat into useful work.  The analysis may also suggest means of improving the performance of quantum refrigerators, which are needed due to the push to reduce the size of electronic components and the associated problems of heat dissipation.  Novel tests of the theory will be carried out in collaborations by the Hunt research group with experimental research groups.  The theory will be applied in the context of quantum computing, to suggest new algorithms that may minimize error and to probe effects of quantum entanglement.  In addition to the potential broader impacts in engineering and computer science mentioned above, the project will have broader impact in integrating STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) research with education, through the inclusion of undergraduates and high school students in the research team and the preparation of pedagogical articles.  The full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities will be encouraged throughout the project.<br/><br/>The Hunt group has explored a theory that goes beyond Dirac?s theory of transitions, to separate the actual excitations of quantum systems from the adiabatic response to a perturbation.  The group will develop methods to take full account of decoherence and decay of excited states, leading to predictions for the occupancy of excited states that are expected to differ from Dirac theory, after a perturbation has ended.  Vibrational spectroscopy of polyaromatic compounds, ultrafast spectroscopy of small molecules, and nonadiabatic electronic transitions in larger molecules will be used as test cases.  In addition, the production of molecules in selected excited rovibrational states via Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage will be investigated, with the potential effects of non-zero phase damping added to the existing theory.  As applied to the operation of quantum Otto engines, the Hunt-group theory is known to produce differences from previous theories in the quantum-state occupancies at the end of the power stroke; it is expected to predict differences in the overall engine efficiency, surpassing the Carnot limits.  A new algorithm for adiabatic quantum computing will be investigated, based on step-wise separation of nonadiabatic and adiabatic response, to reduce errors.

The ability to predictably design multicellular responses in diverse bacterial communities would have a wide range of applications including efficient biomanufacturing, bioenergy conversion, novel therapeutic strategies, sustainable agriculture, and bioremediation. To date, numerous naturally occurring interactions and modes of communication within bacterial communities have been identified, yet there is not the ability to engineer synthetic bacterial communities that have these complex interactions and dynamic responses among diverse bacteria. This collaborative project aims to improve understanding of interspecies biochemical cell-cell communication that can occur in natural microbial communities and allow us to leverage the highly complex functions afforded by these systems within synthetic diverse bacterial communities as programmable living devices. This project will create synthetic bacterial consortia for biosensing and bioremediation of many hazardous water contaminants, including some of the most dangerous drinking water and aquatic ecosystem contaminants. This project will provide education and research training for numerous K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Hands-on workshops will be run at UMass Amherst and Boston University each year for high school students to learn about studying and engineering bacterial communities.

This research focuses on one of the most successful pathogens of vertebrates - a skin fungus that is lethal to hundreds of amphibian species - to resolve how generalist pathogens cross habitat and host species boundaries, at times impacting entire ecosystems and watersheds. The project is global in scope, with field sites in three megadiverse tropical frog communities in Brazil, Peru, and Cameroon. By advancing disease transmission theory for diverse wildlife communities, this research will provide novel insights into impacts of emerging diseases and increase our capacity to forecast and respond to disease outbreaks. The researchers will work with the multimedia magazine bioGraphic to produce a video story detailing the motivation and progress of the team?s research in Brazil, with an expected reach of > 1 million views. The researchers will also work with the education department at the California Academy of Sciences to develop and disseminate an introductory video, lesson plan, and interactive game for K-12 audiences that teach the concepts of host-pathogen dynamics and showcase the tools scientists use to study and model these systems. The projected reach is 35,000 K-12 teachers per year.<br/><br/>Our three-tiered research approach includes 1) field surveys spanning the old world and new world tropics to assess infection patterns in diverse amphibian communities across space and time, 2) a field experiment to isolate the effects of climatic variability on amphibian community structure and disease risk, and 3) novel methods of disease modelling that integrate observational and experimental data to forecast disease dynamics and population demographics at the community scale. A cornerstone of our integrative approach is to examine the disease dynamics of fully terrestrial amphibians. This guild of tropical frogs has been experiencing cryptic population declines and extinctions ostensibly linked to disease, droughts, shifts in host behavior, spatial aggregation, and pathogen spillover. The field survey component will compare spatiotemporal disease dynamics among co-occurring terrestrial-breeding and aquatic-breeding amphibian species, focusing on divergent host movement patterns and responses to climatic variability. The experiment in Brazil will manipulate rainfall variability in large-scale field enclosures to test hypotheses on host movement patterns and infection dynamics of terrestrial- and aquatic-breeding leaf litter frogs. Field surveys and experimental data will be integrated within a multi-host disease modeling framework. This framework will apply recently developed N-mixture models accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection, together with a Bayesian population viability analysis, to predict long-term host population stability exposed to pathogens under future climate scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 70% of the 16 million Americans diagnosed with cancer will undergo ineffective chemotherapy cycles through trial-and-error methods. On average, a cycle of chemotherapy costs $30 k and takes 12 weeks to complete; cancer patients undergo 5-6 cycles at a cost of an estimated $180 k. This project advances a method to pre-screen response to chemotherapy drugs so that clinicians can select the most effective treatment, consequently shortening the duration, reducing complications, improving outcomes, and reducing the financial burden. The technology uses a quick, single-step, scalable, inexpensive, and automated process that tests a wide range of drugs in less than a week. With this technology, the oncologist will be able to select the most effective chemotherapy drug for a cancer patient, on an individualized basis and prior to initiating treatment. The proposed personalized approach would reduce the number of chemotherapy cycles to 1-2, and save up to $120 k per treatment, generating annual national savings of $18.2 B.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development, proof-of-concept validation, and preclinical evaluation of an automated biochip platform that grows patients? cancer cells outside the body to screen them against chemotherapeutic drugs. In the research described herein, tumor specimens from patient biopsies will be grown and maintained as microtumors in the biochips to recapitulate clinical tumor behavior. The biochips and process will be optimized to create microtumors that can be used toward evaluating the performance of cancer treatment. Research objectives are to I) evaluate, refine, and optimize the design of the biochips through simulation studies to ensure compatibility with native tumor microstructure and mass transfer behavior; II) evaluate the formation, growth, and behavior of patient-derived microtumors in the biochips; and III) investigate the response of patient-derived microtumors to anti-cancer drugs in comparison to longitudinal clinical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, natural processes driven by plate tectonics mean that this sedimentary record is inherently incomplete. At different times during Earth?s history, some regions experienced sediment deposition, which buries and therefore heats up rocks, while other regions experienced erosion, which both removes portions of the rock record and cools off the rocks that persist by bringing them closer to Earth?s surface. This study will use the geochemical signatures of rock heating and cooling that occurs during deposition and erosion to understand the geologic histories of areas where no sedimentary rocks remain. Specifically, the study will investigate the ancient record of supercontinent breakup, a process that drives changes in sea level, global climate, and topography. This project will provide support for three early-career researchers at different universities, including two women, and build new relationships among the collaborating research groups. Three graduate and nine undergraduate students from different universities will be engaged in collaborative, hypothesis-driven research and learn a range of field, laboratory, and science communication methods. The researchers will also collaborate with the Idaho Museum of Natural History to create a mobile museum exhibit that will highlight the ancient history of the charismatic mountain ranges in the study area and visit museums that serve rural communities in the Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Unconformities, which are abundant in the rock record, are traditionally viewed as unfillable gaps in the rock record of Earth?s history. However, the thermal imprint of sedimentary cover on the basement rocks that underlie many unconformities provides a rich archive of the otherwise inaccessible parts of a continent?s tectonic history. This record is now accessible due to recent conceptual and analytical advances in low-temperature thermochronology. The primary objective of this study is to contribute to these advances by targeting a critical gap in knowledge about Laurentian tectonics, the breakup of supercontinent Rodinia, while establishing an approach to deep-time thermochronology that can document Precambrian tectonic activity in regions that also experienced significant Phanerozoic mountain building. This study will sample along a 700-kilometer-long segment of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, targeting basement rocks directly below the Great Unconformity and using four chronometers to produce holistic tectonothermal histories to fill a billion-year gap in the rock record. This study will demonstrate how deep time thermochronology can provide a new perspective on the geometry and tectonic evolution of western Laurentia?s rifted margin, where much or all of the sedimentary record of Neoproterozoic tectonism is missing. This capability will be tested by (1) establishing a clear link between extant Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks and Neoproterozoic tectonothermal events in the Uinta Mountains, (2) documenting the Proterozoic thermal histories of basement blocks with no overlying Neoproterozoic strata in the Teton Range and southwestern Montana, and (3) quantifying intra-mountain range variability of Proterozoic thermal histories to evaluate the sampling spatial resolution necessary for extracting meaningful tectonic information from the deep-time thermochronologic record.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the EAR Tectonics Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such outsourcing and benefits lead to complex verification of the fabricated ICs. Additionally, the security threats in terms of reverse engineering the design have surfaced. To address such reverse engineering of ICs, this project proposes insertion of noise in the IC layout that minimizes the probability of success in IC reverse engineering. The insertion of noise must also meet the standard IC design flow requirements and pass the verification and validation.  <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this project integrates the adversarial machine learning with the IC design flow to enable efficient IC design protection despite attacker obtaining the scanning electron microscope (SEM)/layout images of a given IC. In the first phase, the project develops a surrogate machine learning model to detect the gates in SEM images, followed by incubation of novel adversarial perturbations under spatial constraints on the SEM images. The perturbations obtained through the adversarial learning will be evaluated and embedded in some of the available open-source standard cell libraries, guaranteeing compatibility with existing IC design flow tools. <br/><br/>Successful completion of the project will result in a suite of secure IC cell libraries that are compatible with IC design flows. Specifically, this project (i) develops novel IC cell layouts that cannot be identified by an adversary despite obtaining the images through reverse engineering; (ii) introduces novel adversarial perturbation generation under spatial constraints. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, the outcome of the project impacts a broad variety of researchers in the domains of IC design and adversarial machine learning. The development of library cells from this project will be outsourced with relevant licenses to academia and industry. <br/><br/>The project is expected to generated multiple types of data including IC layouts, SEM images, and cell models. All the codes will be written using Python, and SystemC/Verilog (If required). Fully functional and tested codes will be documented and will be made available through GitHub. The website of PIs (http://mymason.gmu.edu/~spudukot) will add a new page for downloading the source codes.

Two key concerns are that errors in healthcare claims result in frequent payment denials, and failure to obtain prior authorization can make those services non-reimbursable. These issues can lead to inappropriate direct billing to patients and/or a write-off by the healthcare provider and cost-shifting to cover losses. In addition, complexity within the rules for payment and prior authorization require considerable administrative overhead for claim submission, reconciliation, and rework, inflating administrative costs. The proposed project addresses these inefficiencies in the health care reimbursement system. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use advanced analytics, machine learning, and blockchain technologies to address the following research objectives: (1) analyze and predict healthcare claim risk for denial of payment; (2) predict the likelihood of a prior authorization requirement before a clinical intervention is undertaken; and (3) incentivize accuracy in the claim submission process and decrease associated administrative burden and cost. The research will conduct advanced claims parsing, data extraction, modeling, and machine learning to define specific patterns of risk, and build reproducible, efficient, and accurate predictive algorithms. These approaches will be applied to both claim denials and to clinical data predictive of prior authorization. Blockchain technology will be utilized to incentivize demographic and clinical data collection and claims processing workflows for improvements in data accuracy, efficiency of collection, and predictive quality. The technical result will be an accurate, predictive, continually learning, highly efficient machine learning toolset integrated with a productivity engine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the regulatory pathways that control stress responses in bacteria. The results will shed new light into how bacteria survive stresses, and could lead to new technological advances in synthetic biology and to sorely-needed antimicrobial drugs.

Using light to interrogate matter is the basis of spectroscopy, which provides the most powerful set of tools for unraveling mechanisms of chemical reactions, structures and intrinsic properties of materials and biological objects. Using high-energy (X-rays) and high-intensity radiation opens new exciting opportunities, which motivate the worldwide development of multi-billion facilities for advanced light sources. Recent advances in beam quality in these facilities greatly expanded possible applications of X-rays, giving rise to a proliferation of techniques including those operating in time-resolved and non-linear regimes. These novel techniques promise to greatly expand our ability to interrogate molecular structure and dynamics, but their full potential can only be realized when experiment is augmented by accurate theoretical tools for modeling these phenomena. Despite significant efforts, the theory is still lagging behind the experimental capabilities, creating a bottleneck for maximizing the scientific impact of multi-billion advanced light source facilities. Krylov will bridge this gap by developing novel electronic structure methods for modeling linear and non-linear core-level spectroscopies in the gas and condensed phases. The research plans include training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs for careers in academia and industry as well as contributions to the research infrastructure.<br/><br/>Capitalizing on her previous work, Krylov will further extend highly reliable coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion CC (EOM-CC) methods to the domain of core-level ionized and excited states by exploiting core-valence separation (CVS) and damped response theory (or complex polarization propagator, CPP) approaches.

Montemore of Tulane University is jointly funded by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of  Chemistry, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to develop a new, more efficient machine learning framework for chemistry and materials science. While machine-learning has been very useful for efficient screening of molecules and materials, previous approaches generally require a new machine learning model for each application. For example, a machine learning model that is used to design one type of battery can usually not be used for other types of batteries. Creating a new model from scratch for each battery type requires significant time and effort to generate data and perform fitting. In the work supported here, Dr. Montemore and his research group will develop the capability to generate machine learning models that can be reused for many applications; for example, a single model could be used for designing many types of batteries. Broadly, this will be useful in many areas of chemistry and materials science, and the Montemore group will release user-friendly code and models to allow other research groups to effectively leverage the framework. Dr. Montemore is also advising the local chapter of the Society for Hispanic Engineers, and working with Louisiana Dow Chemical to provide workshops and mentorship for the membership. Additionally, Dr. Montemore is advising a number of undergraduate researchers, including several from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The new machine learning architecture that Dr. Montemore and his group will develop here is designed based on chemical principles, such as the existence of elements as discrete entities (and not as part of a continuous space). Briefly, the architecture uses latent (i.e., intermediate) variables to partially decouple different guests and different host elements, which greatly simplifies the learning task for each submodel. This is a significant departure from most screening approaches, which use off-the-shelf ML models to map continuous features onto a target variable and must learn chemical principles during fitting. The architecture is well-suited to handling heterogenous data sets, such as a mixture of computational and experimental data. It also does not require very large data sets, in contrast to deep-learning approaches. The models are often interpretable, as predictions can be explained in terms of latent variables or host features. Finally, the architecture is well-suited to transfer learning, which uses a pre-trained model to accelerate the creation of new models. In summary, this architecture harnesses fundamental chemical principles, especially those present in applications involving guest-host chemical bonding, to significantly increase the efficiency of materials screening. Overall, the primary benefits of this approach are significantly increased speedup in materials screening by allowing reusability, and the possibility of more sophisticated, effective screening by predicting multiple quantities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop will be an opportunity for participants from a wide variety of institutions and backgrounds to learn advanced topics in algebraic topology, an area of mathematics that uses tools from algebra to study certain invariant properties of geometric objects. The advantage of the workshop is that the questions and problems in this field are easy to state and motivate, yet their study naturally leads one to consider modern developments in the field of algebraic topology. The active-learning format, and emphasis on co-creating mathematics in community with one another, will allow for significant collaboration between participants and for interactions with the scientific committee. The approachability of the topic and the format of the workshop will attract participants coming from institutions with smaller topology research groups, as well as those with marginalized or underrepresented aspects of their identity. The scientific committee itself is made up of early-career researchers, and more than half of the organizing and scientific committee are women. This representation and the diverse perspectives it offers for the design of the summer school will have a positive impact on attendees.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the summer school is to introduce participants to tools and ideas from algebraic topology and homotopy theory through the lens of fixed point theory. The workshop will be structured around mini-courses taught in an active-learning style and course topics will range from classical fixed point theory to modern tools such as duality, spectra, and trace methods in algebraic K-theory. This range reflects recent and superficially unrelated advances in homotopy theory and higher category theory that have provided new approaches to topological fixed point theory. These approaches have refined classical invariants defined using simplicial structures that were often difficult to generalize. This shift in perspective also illuminated the centrality of additivity for useful fixed point invariants. Since algebraic K-theory is the universal home for additive invariants, it is natural to look for connections between fixed point theory and algebraic K-theory. This connection is further supported by the recent important developments in computations of K-groups. Work of some members of the scientific committee has established that these computational approaches can be effectively modeled using the new forms of fixed point invariants.

Many of the fluids (e.g., mucous) in which these organisms ?swim? contain large macromolecules such as proteins that limit successful swimming. It is more difficult to swim through these ?sticky? fluids. It has recently been suggested theoretically that a type of microbial swimming called ?swirl? can create propulsion in complex liquids that would not be possible in ?simple,? less sticky fluids. Swirl is characterized by parts of the body spinning around the axis of an axisymmetric body. Swirl is a key feature of the swim stroke of many micro-organisms. This award will develop a novel micro-robot that demonstrates the characteristics of swirl propulsion in complex fluids and uses that propulsion to measure the properties of the surrounding fluid. Thus, it is a dynamic sensor of complex fluid properties or a ?swimming rheometer?. <br/><br/>Standard rheometers are desktop devices where fluid is brought to the device and the native environment of the fluid application is reproduced in the device. The state of stress in the shear flow of complex fluids requires the measurement of at least three material properties as a function of the shear rate in the fluid. The goal in the present award is that through design, miniaturization, and optimization of a newly developed ?swirling? robot, rheometry will be transformed to a remote, in situ sensing science. Thus, one will bring the ?rheometer to the fluid application? rather than bringing a fluid sample to a fixed rheometer. A tennis ball-size prototype has already been created and the primary concepts are successfully demonstrated. The robot was designed and will continue to be optimized via large scale computer simulation. The miniaturized robot will have immediate medical and biological applications including measuring the complex rheological properties of synovial fluid as a direct mapping to several disease conditions. Moreover, multiple miniaturized robots will be used to examine the collective dynamics of these micro-swirlers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ceremonial centers with impressive monuments and extensive domestic zones have often been interpreted as early villages, making them among the first permanent settlements in their respective regions. Characteristics of early villages such as year-round occupation, integrative social institutions, and incipient forms of complex social organization usually developed in contexts of regional population pressure and circumscription, which limited the ability of people to move freely across the landscape. Limitations on mobility are thought to be a necessary part of this process to counteract the pressure to disperse due to social conflict that accompanies daily life in densely populated, permanent settlements. However, Eastern North America seems to be an exception, as hunter-gatherer populations in this region came together to form large, monumental centers resembling villages in the absence of strong external constraints on mobility. Does the emergence of hunter-gatherer ceremonial centers in Eastern North America represent an alternative trajectory for the development of sedentism and social complexity? Contemporary American society is subject to some of the same tensions that characterized the beginnings of sedentary village life, such as that between autonomy and communalism, making the topic of how and why people in the past voluntarily aggregated into large, dense, and permanent social groups an important area of inquiry. Research conducted as part of this study will provide archaeological education and training opportunities for local volunteers and students.<br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate hunter-gatherer ceremonial centers in Eastern North America to outline how the process of settlement aggregation occurred and how it may have differed from other world regions. The researchers will focus on one large ceremonial center. This site witnessed the development of several large mound centers that have been characterized as early villages. Despite its exceptional size, the site has received comparatively little attention from archaeologists and the nature of its settlement is still largely unknown. Integrating data from excavation, radiocarbon dating, botanical analysis, and ceramic provenance will permit the evaluation of differing models of settlement, mobility, and social organization. These data will then be compared with other ceremonial centers and early villages from North America and other parts of the world to better understand the various trajectories that led hunter-gatherer populations to develop large, permanent settlements and complex societies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dubbed a ?global destroyer of crops?, the soilborne fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina infects the roots of more than 500 plant species including many economically significant crops. Global warming promotes the spread of M. phaseolina. Losses in US field crop production caused by this fungus are increasing due to restrictions on toxic fumigation methods. Thus, alternative, innovative methods to reduce damage caused by M. phaseolina are urgently needed. Plant defense processes against M. phaseolina are poorly understood and immunity in roots is an understudied area. Taking advantage of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, which allows for rapid progress in experimental studies, the genetic basis of natural disease resistance in plant roots against M. phaseolina will be examined. This study is expected to identify genes and biological processes which mediate protection of plants against this detrimental fungus. Results from this study will accelerate the development of crop cultivars with enhanced disease resistance against M. phaseolina. Its ultimate goal is to reduce the negative impact of M. phaseolina on the U.S. economy. This study will be performed at UC Riverside, a Hispanic Serving Institution, and one of the most ethnically diverse research universities in the USA. The investigators are deeply committed to the scientific training of members of historically underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>The diploid model plant Arabidopsis thaliana offers substantial advantages over crop systems to study the molecular genetic basis of host resistance against M. phaseolina. Arabidopsis is easily transformed, has genome-wide collections of mutants and transgenics, has a very short generation time, and large populations grow in minimal space. A particularly useful resource is a collection of >1000 natural A. thaliana accessions for which genome sequences have been determined. In this collection, a substantial degree of variation in M. phaseolina resistance is observed, allowing defense loci and biological processes contributing to root immunity against this detrimental pathogen to be uncovered. The central hypothesis of this project is: Natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana will allow the discovery of fundamental mechanisms of root defenses against M. phaseolina. The specific aims being pursued are:(1) Use natural variation within A. thaliana to uncover defense mechanisms against M. phaseolina.(2) Study root cell type-specific immune responses against M. phaseolina.(3) Identify key loci mediating protection against M. phaseolina. By profiling transcriptional patterns associated with M. phaseolina resistance among A. thaliana accessions a description of transcriptionally-controlled regulatory, physiological, and biochemical processes involved in host immunity against M. phaseolina will be delivered. Using root cell type-specific fluorescent marker lines, information on how distinct root tissues operate to mediate protection against M. phaseolina will be provided. Reverse genetics and gene mapping will identify plant genes that contribute to immunity against M. phaseolina, which can be used to inform molecular genetic breeding approaches in crops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microscopic wear traces present on the earliest (stone) tools excavated by archaeologists, offer key insights into how ancient people worked a variety of materials, like wood, skins, ivory, etc. Despite the enormous interpretive potential, archaeologists have experienced problems related to the difficulty and efficiency of securely identifying worked materials from wear traces, as well as reproducing each other?s results. This project will harness the power of tribology and artificial intelligence (AI) to advance understanding how wear patterns form and, at the same time, facilitate and democratize the identification process. Beside scientific publications, the investigators will produce an open-source tool for helping other researchers use their algorithms in their own work. The produced results will thus be useful to both the bio-engineering community as well as to archaeologists. To address pipeline issues in archaeological science, the project will increase diversity and the representation of minority groups by engaging high school students from New York City in the lab experiments.<br/><br/>The project seeks to solve a 70-year standing problem in archaeology: how does wear form on the surface of stone tools as a result of working different materials? Answering this question will generate predictions that will enable large-scale studies of archaeological wear to be carried out in the future. To tackle this problem, an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, together with mechanical and bio-materials engineers will first catalogue the mechanical properties of natural worked materials, such as wood, ivory, skins, etc. The researchers will then build surrogate biomaterials isolating the role of these properties (such as hardness, elasticity, fracture toughness, etc.), so that their effect on wear formation can be tested individually in experiments. Each surrogate material will be rubbed against experimentally produced stone bits using a tribometer. The result will be a large collection of recorded wear patterns that can be causally correlated with worked material properties. In a second experiment, stone bits will be used in more realistic tasks using a force-controlled robot and organic target materials to generate a large collection of wear patterns that approximate archaeological wear. Information from both experiments will be used to train computers to classify archaeologically occurring wear patterns according to the materials they most likely came into contact with. Moreover, classification algorithms with and without expert input for identifying worked materials will be compared, which addresses the application of artificial intelligence in archaeology, a topic which is currently of great interest to archaeologists in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the possibility of using the quantum properties of the light field to overcome diffraction has become one of the main goals of quantum imaging. The interest in quantum optical superresolution resides in its potential for improving the performance of existing schemes for remote imaging and microscopy. Interestingly, seminal work that established the foundations of classical superresolution imaging was awarded with the Nobel Prize of Chemistry in 2014. These fundamental contributions demonstrated the possibility of performing imaging beyond the Abbe-Rayleigh resolution criterion. Recently, researchers from the quantum optics community have conducted experiments that aim to boost spatial resolution of classical schemes for imaging by projecting target objects onto spatial modes. These conventional protocols rely on a series of spatial projective measurements to pick up phase information that is then used to boost the spatial resolution of optical systems. Unfortunately, these schemes require a priori information regarding the coherence properties of the light beams, a well as stringent alignment conditions. The purpose of this research program is to demonstrate that the limited spatial resolution of optical instruments can be overcome through measurements of the quantum statistical properties of photons, which are insensitive to diffraction. The identification of the quantum properties of light will be performed using artificial neural networks. The successful completion of the program will enable transformative technology for remote imaging and superresolving microscopy. The educational objectives of this project are to contribute to the inclusive and fair diffusion of science by engaging students to perform research on superresolving imaging, and by developing a series of lectures and demonstrations for general audiences in the Ascension Parish Library from Louisiana.<br/><br/>This program includes a series of theoretical and experimental milestones.  The theoretical component of this research program aims to develop new formalisms to model the evolution of the properties of quantum coherence of multiparticle systems. These physical systems lead to computationally hard problems scaling on the order of O(2nn!), where n represents the number of photons in the imaging system. The experimental part of the program will be carried out in table-top optical setups. The investigators will prepare multiple light sources with tunable coherence properties and degrees of indistinguishability, these beams will be characterized through photon-number-resolving detection. These capabilities will enable the team to 1) develop a general theory of quantum coherence to describe the photon statistics produced by the combination of an arbitrary number of light sources, 2) design artificial neural networks to demonstrate single-pixel cameras with photon-number resolution, and 3) experimentally demonstrate single-pixel superresolution imaging of an arbitrary number of photon emitters and scatterers. The completion of these milestones will lead to the first family of superresolving single-pixel cameras that exploit the self-learning features of artificial intelligence to identify the statistical fluctuations of truly unknown mixtures of light sources. The potential of these novel photonic devices will be explored in the context of remote imaging and microscopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The warming and cooling have a variety of climatic effects, including changes in the number of hurricanes each summer, the abundance of rainfall in the southeast US and North Africa, and winter temperatures in Europe.  A particularly severe example is the prolonged Sahel drought that occurred during the cooling period after 1960.<br/><br/>The causes of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations are not clear and there is considerable debate as to whether they are the result of natural climate variability or are externally forced.  On the natural variability side SST could change due to the speeding up and slowing down of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), in which cold water sinks in the high northern latitudes, circulates around the world at depth, and returns after upwelling to the surface south of the equator.  On the external forcing side there is considerable interest in the effects of anthropogenic aerosols, which cool the sea surface by reflecting sunlight back to space.  Aerosol emission from North America became more intensive throughout the midcentury but diminished starting in the 1960s, thus modulation of Atlantic SSTs by upstream aerosol sources is a credible theory.  The debate between proponents of internal variability and external forcing has not yet been resolved, for reasons including the short observational record (only two full cycles), the lack of AMOC observations, and the lack of long-term measurement of aerosol concentrations over the oceans.<br/><br/>Research under this award addresses the question of internal variability versus external forcing using climate model simulations and observational datasets.  The work takes advantage of large ensembles of simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), in which the difference between individual simulations is due purely to natural climate system variability.  In particular the project uses simulation ensembles of 20th century climate in which one type of external forcing is removed, for instance one ensemble excludes greenhouse gas increases but retains aerosols, land cover change, volcanic eruptions, etc..  The all-but-one simulation suite includes an ensemble which omits only the aerosols from biomass burning while retaining industrial aerosols, and another which omits only industrial aerosols.  The project uses these simulations to look at possible differences in the effects of the two aerosol types. In addition, the project generates new simulations using a configuration in which AMOC influence is ruled out by replacing the ocean with a motionless ""slab"".  The project also goes beyond the common assumption that the SST variability is either due to internal variability or external forcing and explores the possibility that the AMOC is itself affected by anthropogenic aerosols.<br/><br/>The work has societal value due to the wide-ranging effects of changes in North Atlantic SSTs.  In particular it informs efforts to predict climate variations in the North Atlantic sector including some which use climate models to predict the future evolution of the AMOC.  The project conducts community outreach in various ways including participation in Riverside community events, partnership with local organizations including the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, and engagement with K-12 students through the Geoscience Education Outreach Program (GEOP).  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students and two undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They form the basic ingredients of our visual perception and inspire the development of far-reaching mathematical tools. Yet there are still many fundamental open questions in this area that are strikingly intuitive and elementary to state.  Studying these questions may stimulate useful developments in pure mathematics and lead to wider applications in science and technology. For instance, the isoperimetric inequality has numerous applications due to its connections with a host of other important inequalities, including the Sobolev inequality in mathematical analysis and the Faber-Krahn inequality in spectral analysis. Furthermore, the rigidity of surfaces may have applications for stability of complicated domes in modern architecture, while the medial axis, or cut locus of distance functions, is an important tool in shape recognition, which is of interest in computer graphics and mathematical biology. These questions are ideal for introducing the public to the exciting world of modern mathematics and arousing the interest of beginning students in geometry. This project will engage in a range of activities, including accessible public lectures and articles, to promote these topics.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with curves and surfaces, and more broadly Riemannian submanifolds, spanning a wide range of topics and tools including isoperimetric problems, isometric embeddings, geometric knot theory, polyhedral approximations, h-principle theory, and curvature flows. Some recurring themes throughout these investigations, which the PI conducts in joint work with his students and collaborators, are various notions of convexity or optimization and the interaction between geometric and topological concepts, or local versus global properties of submanifolds. More specifically, a typical question is how restrictions on curvature, intrinsic metric, or various boundary conditions influence the global shape of a curve or a hypersurface or allow an isometric embedding of that object in a space of low codimension. For instance, the PI recently established Zalgaller?s conjecture on the length and shape of the shortest closed curve that contains the unit sphere in its convex hull. Other projects include rigidity of isometric embeddings, unfoldability of convex polyhedra or Durer?s conjecture, optimization problems for space curves, and the study of the cut locus of distance functions, or medial axis, of contractible regions in Riemannian manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plant cells mobilize their highly dynamic subcellular compartments, known as organelles, to fulfill physiological functions in growth and development.  This project will uncover the poorly understood mechanisms by which organelles move and distribute along molecular tracks called actin filaments within plant cells in response to internal and external signals.  The focus will be on peroxisomes and mitochondria, two organelles that are physically and biochemically connected and essential for energy metabolism and survival of plants.  The molecular machinery responsible for the motility and distribution of these two types of organelles will be dissected, using the small mustard plant Arabidopsis.  Knowledge gained will provide fundamental insights into the principles associated with the motility of plant organelles, thereby giving perspectives on how these molecular machineries evolved.  In addition, the project will train graduate and undergraduate students in modern biological skills.  Hands-on research experience will be provided to first-year undergraduate students in the classroom with the goal of retaining them in science majors.  Discovery-based summer trainings will be provided to undergraduates in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, physiology and computational biology in order to prepare them for a scientific career or advanced training after graduation.  <br/><br/>Cytoskeleton-dependent active movement and distribution of organelles are fundamentally significant for cell growth, division, and signaling.  However, how organelles recruit cytoskeletal motor proteins for their directional transport along the cytoskeletal tracks is complex and often under debate.  This project focuses on molecular mechanisms underlying the motility and distribution of plant peroxisomes and mitochondria, multifunctional and metabolically linked organelles essential for energy metabolism and plant viability.  An exploratory effort detected directional transport of peroxisomes along actin filaments and discovered candidate proteins functioning at the interface between peroxisomes/mitochondria and the cytoskeleton for organellar motility and distribution in Arabidopsis thaliana.  It is hypothesized that the active long-distance movement of peroxisomes/mitochondria along actin filaments is regulated by organelle-specific receptor/adaptor proteins and GTPases, which recruit the actin-associated Myosin XI motors that energize the motility.  The project includes three aims:  (1) Determining the role of the actin-binding protein Peroxisomal and Mitochondrial Division 1 (PMD1) in mediating the tethering of peroxisomes/mitochondria to the actin filaments; (2) Dissecting the adaptor complex that recruits Myosin XI to the peroxisome by testing the roles of TONSOKU-associated protein 1 (TSA1), the RABE1c GTPase, and the peroxin PEX5; and (3) Dissecting the adaptor complex that recruits Myosin XI to mitochondria by testing the functions of Cardiomyopathy-Associated Protein (CMYA) and the MIRO1 GTPase.  Protein immuno-affinity purification, proteomics, live-cell imaging, genetics and physiological phenotyping will be employed to untangle interactions between peroxisomes/mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton that regulate organelle motility and advance the understanding of the impact of organelle motility on plant fitness.  In addition, the project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in modern biological and computational techniques at both universities.

This project will open up new educational applications for online delivery of field trips that heavily rely on dangerous, or financially prohibitive locations. In this project, multi-user 360-degree panoramic collaborative spaces (360PICS) will be used to create digital field trip experiences that illustrate the real sites where geographically-dispersed students can connect and interact with each other. This project will advance the understanding of the site visit experiences for STEM students and investigate the conditions under which improved student learning occurs through online, easy-to-access, digital site visits. Students will be able to engage with other students within the 360PICS environment while staying focused on practicing the skills required on those site visit experiences.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to present civil, architectural and construction engineering students with opportunities to enable online location-independent site visits, using real-world occasions where situated learning is dangerous, unsafe, or difficult to achieve. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) characterize student communication and collaboration during digital site visits, (2) capture, develop, and define 360PICS affordances that are most conducive to enhance student communication and collaboration during digital site visits, and (3) assess the influence of 360PICS on student communication and collaboration during digital site visits. Web-based virtual reality techniques will be employed to develop 360PICS and create the required communication and collaboration affordances. The uses and effects of 360PICS will be assessed using a mixed-method approach, collecting qualitative and quantitative measurements to specifically understand the influence of 360PICS on student communication and collaboration during digital site visits. In connection with this project, educational and outreach efforts will be integrated into several online courses, workshops, webinars, and outreach activities. This project will also provide the opportunity for online project-based learning for undergraduate students as a part of a 360PICS-based course module. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their divergent characteristics, including structure, stability, function and activity, can be attributed to various degrees to the presence of the 2'-OH in RNA and its absence in DNA. The 2'-OH affects the sugar conformational equilibrium and thereby the geometry of paired RNA strands, and ultimately the much-expanded 3D fold-space of RNA compared to DNA. The 2'-OH is the only hydrogen bond donor in the nucleic acid backbone and results in increased RNA hydration and thermodynamic stability relative to DNA. Moreover, the 2'-OH acts as nucleophile in RNA splicing reactions and ribozyme-catalyzed phosphodiester cleavage. Structural biology has ignored the 2'-OH hydrogen/orientation, owing to technical limitations of X-ray crystallography (XC) and challenges to solution studies such as rapid exchange. Neutron crystallography (NC) reveals the locations of hydrogen atoms (2H, deuterium or D) in biomacromolecules. In the project joint cryo-NC/XC will be used on several RNA targets to assess: (i) The importance of the 2'-OH in RNA?s expansive fold space, (ii) How binding proteins might influence 2'-OH orientation to sculpt the RNA backbone, and (iii) Differences in 2'- and 3'-OH orientations in 5'-3' and 5'-2' linked RNAs, respectively, that might explain the latter?s demise in nature. The rigorous, combined NC/XC approach will produce improved models of water structure and a better understanding of nucleic acid structure, function and interactions with binding proteins. The project work will ultimately enable refined theoretical treatments of macromolecules and hydration, e.g., by molecular dynamics simulations. Structural refinements and data science aspects of this research, including PDB searches and large-scale analysis of pucker modes provide ideal projects for high-school students/undergraduates as part of Vanderbilt?s Aspirnaut program.<br/><br/>Neutron crystallography (NC) reveals the locations of hydrogen atoms (2H, deuterium or D) in biomacromolecules. Conversely, X-ray crystallography (XC) cannot pinpoint H atoms even at high resolution. Cryo NC also establishes the orientations of first- and higher-shell D2O. However, NC research has remained high-risk/-impact, owing to the need for large crystals, perdeuterated samples and limited access to beamlines. Recently the PI applied cryo NC for the first time to an RNA structure using state-of the-art instrumentation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Cryo NC uncovered roles of ribose hydroxyls (2'-OHs) in stabilizing non-canonical backbone geometries, a structural correlation between 2'-OH orientation and sugar pucker, and a 6:1 preference of the 2'-OH to act as H-bond donor rather than acceptor. These insights lead to hypotheses in regard to: (i) The importance of the 2'-OH moiety in RNA?s expanded fold space relative to DNA (ii) How binding proteins might influence 2'-OH orientation and flip the ribose pucker to sculpt the RNA backbone geometry, and (iii) Differences in 2'- and 3'-OH orientations in 5'-3' and 5'-2' linked RNAs, respectively, that may explain the latter?s demise in nature. Water in living systems is omnipresent and is involved in governing folding, geometry, stability, dynamics, function and interactions of proteins and nucleic acids. The rigorous cryo NC/XC approach will produce improved models of water structure, with implications for our understanding of nucleic acid structure, function and interactions with binding proteins. The project work will ultimately enable refined theoretical treatments of macromolecules and hydration by QM-MM and MD simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main topics in low-dimensional topology is to study the topological and geometric properties of the link, the three-dimensional space, and some four-dimensional spaces bounded by the three-space. This project aims to deepen understanding of these mathematical structures. The first part of the research concentrates on the study of three-manifolds obtained from links via the so-called ""Dehn surgery"" operation and the family of links appearing in algebraic geometry. Results are anticipated to advance the understanding of the complexity of three-manifolds and algebraic singularities in algebraic geometry. It will also provide topics that are suitable for undergraduate students' research. The second part of the research focuses on the topology, geometry, and dynamics of hyperbolic manifolds, which are important examples of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, negatively curved Hadamard manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-compact type.<br/><br/>The research consists of four specific projects about links and hyperbolic manifolds. The first aims to understand the possible obstructions for surgeries on 2-component links in the three-sphere. It focuses on the possibility of finding an infinite family of integer homology spheres that cannot be obtained by surgeries on 2-component links in the three-sphere. The second project is to understand the link Floer chain complex of algebraic links coming from the singularities of algebraic curves in the complex plane and provide potential applications in low dimensional topology. The third project is to study discrete isometry subgroups acting on hyperbolic spaces with small critical exponents and generalize the structure theorem for hyperbolic manifolds to negatively curved Hadamard manifolds. The fourth project concerns a counting question in hyperbolic manifolds, with the goal of determining whether the classical Bowen-Margulis measure and the spectral gap converge for a strongly convergent sequence of hyperbolic manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this approach is limited by available materials that can withstand these extreme environments.  In this Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future  (DMREF) project, the discovery of new materials that enable higher temperature turbine operation will be accelerated through computational methods that are validated with experimental results. Materials to be studied include mixed rare earth silicates for potential high temperature coatings of turbine engine components. Coatings currently under development use a single rare earth element in the silicate. Mixing various combinations of the fifteen rare earth elements in the silicates provides opportunities to discover and optimize desirable coating properties, including low thermal conductivity and high stability in the reactive turbine engine environments.  High throughput computational approaches will be used to understand trends in material properties as the composition is varied. The concept of accelerated material discovery will be taught to the university students involved in the project and the application and importance of materials in engines will be demonstrated to elementary students through outreach activities.<br/><br/>Technical Description: This research will accelerate new understanding of the interplay of cation complexity on phase stability of high entropy rare earth silicates in extreme environments. The computation-experiment-feedback loop coupled with machine learning and high throughput computation will result in heretofore unrealized linkages of entropy-induced material stability, thermal properties, and corrosion resistance. The project will result in advances in fundamental understanding and discovery of novel materials that can be designed for specific extreme environment applications. The computational approach to materials discovery will utilize AFLOW: high throughput property prediction. These predictions will be tested by characterizing rare earth silicates synthesized via solid state sintering, chemical techniques for improved cation mixing, and gas phase pulsed laser deposition of thin films.  Phase stability and chemical disorder will be characterized through use of techniques including X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Resulting stability of rare earth silicate mixtures will inform improvements in the computational approach for materials discovery. Additionally, computational approaches will be used to predict phonon transport and thermal properties. These predicted thermal properties will be compared against thermal conductivity measurements as a function of temperature through use of time domain and steady state thermoreflectance, and hot disk techniques. Environmental stability will be experimentally characterized using ""steam-jet"" testing, an extreme environment laboratory test creating high-temperature, high-velocity, reactive steam representative of the combustion environment. Results from both the thermal and environmental testing will be used to validate and advance the computational approaches and property-based materials discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a transition area between electronics and optics as well as a transition area between classical mechanics and quantum physics. The specific location of THz waves in the electromagnetic spectrum also gives them a plethora of unique properties. For an example, THz waves can pass through a variety of substances, including synthetics, textiles, paper, and cardboard. Also, many biomolecules, proteins, explosives or narcotics feature characteristic absorption signatures at the frequencies between 1 and 5 THz. Therefore, two major applications of THz radiation are imaging, sensing and spectroscopy. Besides, unlike X-rays, THz waves do not have any ionizing effects and are generally considered biologically innocuous. This makes THz waves much safer and healthier than X-rays when used for security checks and medical diagnosis. In addition, as the THz frequency is orders of magnitude higher than tht used for traditional wireless internet, there is the potential to apply THz technology for the next-generation of high-speed wireless communications. Unfortunately, current commercial sources of THz radiation are either extremely large or require cryogenic cooling, neither of which are desirable traits for widespread use. By integrating quantum device engineering, nonlinear optics, optical phased arrays, and photonic integrated circuit technology, it may now be possible to realize a compact, mass-producible, and room temperature THz source with high output power in continuous operation.  This source will represent an enabling technology for all of the applications mentioned above.<br/>The proposed THz frequency source is based on difference frequency generation (DFG) in a dual-wavelength quantum cascade laser (QCL) that has been configured as an optical phased array (OPA) for coherent, high power operation.  The utility of the OPA is to both manage waste heat and provide near diffraction limited beam quality for THz emission.  With proper heat management and packaging, this will be the first room chip-based semiconductor laser with > 1 mW CW THz output power at room temperature.  This type of THz source inherits all of the advantages of the mid-infrared QCLs, such as room temperature operation, electrical pumping, compact size, stable emission, and the potential for mass production. This multidisciplinary project is a combination of both theory and experiment covering diverse fields, including semiconductor physics, material science, quantum mechanics, optoelectronics, nonlinear optics, thermal management, and micro/nanotechnology. In additional to the practical use of the technology that will be developed, project details also make an excellent case study for integrated device development, which will be explored as part of the Solid State Engineering curriculum at Northwestern University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most plants and animals are composed of very large numbers of small cells, each serving a specific function in the organism as a whole. Caulerpa is as large as ordinary plants, and has the equivalents of leaves, stems and roots ? but it is, exceptionally, one giant cell that can be up to a meter across.  The single algal cell partitions into organs, rather than, as in other plants, the organs forming from the division and differentiation of many cells.  To understand how organs develop without cell division and cellular specialization, experiments are planned to characterize the expression of genes in different organs when mature and as they develop, and to study the structure of the functionally different parts of this giant cell using electron microscopy.  Additional experiments are planned to localize different gene transcripts to different locations within the cell; and to develop methods for introducing new genetic material to the alga to test mechanisms of gene expression control.  The planned work will fill in knowledge of a little-known part of the ocean ecosystem, and will also inform about the growth and development, and potentially control, of Caulerpa, some species of which are invasive pests.  Algae are also sustainable sources of industrial products. The knowledge gained has the potential to lead to novel products from a currently unused source.  Undergraduate and graduate students, along with postdoctoral reasearchers, will be trained in state-of-the-art genomics methods while learning to address questions that span disciplines of development, cell biology and genomics.<br/><br/>The chlorophyte alga Caulerpa prolifera poses a challenge to the cell theory, which considers organisms with differentiated parts to be social organizations of specialized cells.  Caulerpa  has fronds, stolons and rhizoids as differentiated organs, but consists of a single, giant, multinucleate cell.  Preliminary work shows it to have a 35Mb genome containing around 11,000 genes.  The goal of the proposed work is to learn how organs differentiate without cell division or cellular differentiation.  There are five specific sets of experiments, whose aims are: complete the analysis of the genome with determination of long contigs; test differential RNA expression and differential presence of proteins in mature and developing organs; develop methods for in situ hybridization and FISH-seq for RNA localization in early developing organs; describe the internal structure and development of the different parts of the giant cell using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy; and attempt genetic transformation of the alga by biolistic delivery of fluorescent reporter constructs composed of promoter, gene and 3? untranslated regions derived from endogenous genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important facet of this problem is that of anatomical novelty: how do new structures come into existence? This project will study how a newly evolved structure in the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) first arose. Work in the developmental biology field has traced how most anatomical structures are genetically encoded in the genome by genetic networks that control which subset of genes are expressed in a tissue as it develops. The problem of morphological novelty can be expressed in terms of these networks ? how do the networks that underlie novelties originate? This has been an exceedingly difficult problem for the field to tackle in a satisfying way. Because these networks are complex, we will employ cutting edge genomic approaches to holistically inventory likely participants and pinpoint their relevant gene function-altering mutations. Combining such genomic descriptions with empirical follow-up using the powerful genetic toolkit of Drosophila will permit a deep examination of the molecular changes that occur as new structures evolve. Doing so will inform a wide variety of similar developmental and evolutionary processes in other organisms in which the tools for manipulation and rigorous validation are lacking. This project will have numerous additional broader impacts, including training of scientists, outreach activities for middle school and high school students from backgrounds underrepresented in science, and development of software tools and databases. <br/><br/>The posterior lobe is a morphological novelty specific to Drosophila melanogaster clade. We have previously discovered that the posterior lobe emerged by co-option of a gene regulatory network from another organ system, the posterior spiracle which first forms during embryonic development. However, it is not known which genes upstream of this co-option event were modified and how they were modified. In addition, it is unclear how a similar gene regulatory network generates two completely different structures. These issues will be addressed by identifying altered changes in the network?s regulatory hierarchy and differences in its downstream cellular processes. This will be done by cell sorting with posterior-lobe and spiracle-specific cellular markers, followed by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses. Follow-up studies will identify regulatory sequences responsible for species and context-specific gene expression. These will be validated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, as well as comparative studies of transcriptional regulatory activity with reporter genes in both lobed and non-lobed species.   Resources will also be established to test regulatory elements in the comparison species D. ananassae. Together, this research will establish a premiere system in which the genetic changes underlying a morphological novelty will have been traced and tested in vivo, a problem that has been difficult to unravel in any system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RFIC'22 will be held at the Colorado Convention Center, June 19-21. The Symposium is part of Microwave Week 2022, the world's largest RF and microwave technical convention. Participation at RFIC'22 will expose US-based students to this critical research field of US national interests (e.g., 5G/6G wireless), enhance the research experiences for students, and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations to advance knowledge. However, attending RFIC'22 is getting more expensive each year (transportation, lodging, and registration fees all more costly), and not every researcher has the funds to allow their students to travel to RFIC'22. Moreover, undergraduate students are rarely getting the opportunity for funding as they are typically not engaging in research in their early career. Yet, young students' attendance is important because they represent the future of RFIC'22. Students also benefit tremendously by attending presentations on the latest research, making new connections, and participating in the various conference events. Thus, the NSF RFIC'22 travel grant can help increase student attendance in a significant manner. It is particularly useful to encourage student participation in RFIC'22 workshops, dedicated students forums, panels, demos, tutorials, exhibition, and attending papers presentations. The proposed activity may noticeably improve the participation of US-based students who are female, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields to RFIC'22. It will help enhance the STEM education proficiencies for US-based students. It can also help the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce in the US, and increase partnerships between academia, industry, and government to increase economic competitiveness of the United States.<br/><br/>RFIC'22 offers a number of events specifically beneficial to student researchers, which include technical talks, focused student forums (1st time in the RFIC Symposium history), interactive demo session, workshops, tutorials, technical lecture, exhibition, the three-minute thesis (3MT) competition program, and other targeted student activities. As IEEE RFIC Symposium is one of the world's premier events to learn about RF IC design, technology and research, students are able to obtain feedbacks on their work, talk with senior researchers from government, industry, and academia, and get exposed to the latest research. These activities provide the students the latest updates and direct interactions with world experts from government, industry, and academia, and provide unique training that is not possible from a typical university program. Over the last three years before the COVID-19 pandemic, RFIC Symposium has been a three-day event with over 900 registered attendees, including about 300 students annually and keep growing. We will use this NSF travel fund to fully fund the participation of 12 US-based students (i.e., covering the total cost). The NSF student travel grant program will be publicized on the RFIC'22 website and through special email blasts that will focus on students' activities; it will also be posted on social media (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.). We will also reach out to faculty in US universities and ask them to publicize the grant and encourage their past and current class students to apply for it. The funding will be for full-time students from any U.S. university. RFIC'22 organizers seek to increase student participants by targeting women, undergraduates, and under-represented groups. The aim is to support young researchers who might not otherwise be able to attend RFIC'22 due to financial difficulty, as well as to encourage the diversity of the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, such composition is insecure and the source of countless attacks in the wild. Software sandboxing promises to confine third-party code and ensure that bugs in third-party code cannot compromise the whole system. However, existing sandboxing frameworks only reason about code running in the sandbox and thus their security guarantees don't extend to most real programs, which ultimately need to exit the sandbox to communicate with the outside world. This project will develop foundations, techniques, and frameworks for building end-to-end secure sandboxing systems that provide formal security guarantees even across the sandbox boundary. If successful, this project will let developers safely use and benefit from open source and third-party code, without needing to absorb all the risk. This will, in turn, address many of the security problems that arise when building large software systems and the ensuing financial and social costs associated with cyberattacks.<br/><br/><br/>The investigators will: (1) design novel type systems that will allow developers to explicitly encode sandbox boundary invariants and automatically generate boundary code that is secure by construction; (2) develop formal foundations for sandbox context-switching to characterize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements of secure context-switching; and (3) develop a formal semantics for the interface between the sandbox runtime and the key operating system abstractions that are expose to sandboxed programs to communicate and perform I/O. Together, these formal foundations will be used to synthesize a verified-secure runtime system and portable system interface, which will allow sandboxed modules to safely interact with each other, the application, and operating system services. The project will yield new innovations in the design, implementation, and verification of secure sandboxing frameworks, and lead to new techniques and tools that will empower developers to build large-scale systems that are secure by construction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When freed from the confines of a stable atomic nucleus the neutron is unstable; it decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino with an average lifetime of about fifteen minutes. Neutron decay played an important role in the early universe; it determined the relative abundances of light elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium, and beryllium) and their isotopes that were formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang. Due to its simplicity, neutron decay is an ideal system for studying details of the most basic forces of subatomic physics, in particular the weak nuclear force. Such studies improve our understanding of nature and may provide hints of new fundamental physical phenomena yet to be discovered. The neutron lifetime has been measured with an uncertainty of less than one second by individual experiments, but results from the two main experimental methods, the beam method and the ultracold neutron storage method, currently disagree by more than eight seconds. Resolving this discrepancy is a matter of great importance for nuclear physics. This award supports the design, construction, and testing of a next-generation beam neutron lifetime experiment called BL3. It will employ new, powerful technical features to enable its goals of resolving the discrepancy and providing a reliable measurement of the neutron lifetime to well below one second of uncertainty.<br/><br/>The scope of this project is to design, construct, and test the BL3 apparatus, a new experiment to measure the neutron lifetime using the beam method. It is similar in concept and improves upon previous beam neutron lifetime experiments. It will employ a significantly larger superconducting magnet to accommodate a large area neutron beam and will incorporate many technical improvements, such as much higher counting statistics, a more uniform magnetic field in the trapping region; a large, segmented, ultrathin window silicon proton detector; and a sophisticated neutron time of flight spectrometer. BL3 has two scientific goals: 1) to investigate and test systematic effects in the beam method that may contribute to the 8.4 s (4 sigma) discrepancy between the beam and ultracold neutron storage experiments; and 2) reduce the total uncertainty of the neutron lifetime beam method to less than 0.3 s. The value of the neutron lifetime has important consequences in nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This project provides an excellent opportunity to train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in the methods and theory of neutron science which are applicable to diverse scientific studies in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology at existing and emerging neutron sources around the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to Tennessee State University (TSU) facilitates the development of a revolutionary simulation model for some of the most challenging fluid transport problems that are ubiquitous in many scientific and engineering fields, and, therefore, has tremendous potential impacts on technology, the environment, health, and economy. This project is also dedicated to the involvement of undergraduate students in the research in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields with a unique mentoring plan. In addition, this project promotes the education on scientific computing for undergraduate students at TSU and other HBCUs by merging math, coding, and engineering, in order to improve their math and coding literacy which is essential for them to pursue a STEM career.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a challenging research problem, which is a special type of fluid transport phenomena, characterized by three unique features: multi-scale, porous media, and multi-physics/multi-chemistry. A representative problem is the transport of electrolytes in the porous electrodes of redox flow batteries, which is utilized as a case study to benchmark the developed simulation model as well as to demonstrate its potential. The goal of this project is to develop a specialized simulation model with the high-performance computing capability based on a new methodology that solves the Boltzmann equation with the finite volume method, which allows a convenient adoption of fully unstructured grids to precisely reconstruct the complex three-dimensional boundaries rendered by porous media. The novelty of this project is that it provides a specifically tailored simulation model that demonstrates a superiority in computational performance (defined as accuracy normalized by associated computational cost) over existing methodologies for the multi-scale and multi-physics/multi-chemistry fluid transport phenomena in porous media. This new model can accelerate the understanding of the selected research problem.

The creation of cell diversity is tasked to stem cells, whose divisions can produce distinct, non-identical daughter cells capable of assuming different fates. This so-called asymmetric cell division (ACD) process is essential to proper development and viability. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ACD, therefore, has broad and significant biological importance, particularly considering the conservation of this process across all multicellular life. The goal of this project is to understand how conserved protein complexes that control specific aspects of asymmetric stem cell divisions are regulated to ensure proper development. Although many of the specific components that will be investigated are known, important knowledge gaps remain with respect to how they function at the molecular level. The project will focus particularly on how specific protein complexes assemble and ultimately achieve a cooperative function within the cell. Disruption of these events can lead to defects in tissue development that impact the viability and function of adult organisms. These studies will utilize the common fruit fly as a model genetic organism, whose genes important for ACD are highly conserved to humans. The Broader Impact activities include the intrinsic merit of the research as all multicellular life involves ACD.  The work will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students, with opportunities provided to underrepresented groups to inspire their involvement in a more diverse scientific community.<br/><br/>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is an evolutionarily conserved process that allows progenitor stem cells to produce non-identical daughter cells that ultimately diversify cell fates during development. Proper ACD requires coordinated function between cortical polarity and spindle positioning complexes, and defects that uncouple these disrupt tissue development and homeostasis. The goal of this project is to understand how the conserved Pins/Mud spindle orientation complex organizes at the cell cortex and functions despite competing interactions with cell polarity factors. We provide preliminary data demonstrating that the Pins/Mud complex phase separates into dense liquid droplets in vitro. This is facilitated through a newly-identified interaction between Mud and the actin-binding protein Hts, which we also show to be polarized in Drosophila neural stem cells in vivo. We hypothesize that Hts/Pins/Mud complexes form clustered biological condensates shielded from competing interactions to ensure spindle orientation precision in asymmetrically dividing stem cells. To test this hypothesis, we will use loss-of-function genetic approaches to first determine how Hts polarity is established in neural stem cells and how it impacts localization of core polarity and spindle orientation components. Next, we will use quantitative fluorescence imaging approaches to determine the physical properties of phase separated Pins/Mud droplets in the absence and presence of Hts. Finally, we will use genome editing and high-resolution microscopy to directly ascertain the role of phase separation in the assembly and function of Pins/Mud complexes in vivo. Results from this project will provide insights into the biophysical properties and cellular function of an evolutionarily conserved spindle positioning complex and resolve long-standing knowledge gaps in the molecular underpinnings of ACD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how tendons develop mechanical function is important because tendon injuries are common, treatment options are limited, and damaged tendons rarely regain their full strength. Collagen is a major contributor to tendon strength. However, much is unknown about the conditions that influence collagen formation during normal tendon development. For example, several types of enzymes crosslink and stabilize collagen in tendons, but how cells coordinate the production of these collagen crosslinking enzymes during tendon development is unknown. This project addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the signals that control enzyme production by cells. This research will generate new knowledge on how collagen crosslinking is regulated. Findings from this research will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of tendon formation and may lead to advanced therapies to treat the altered mechanical function and disability found with tendon injuries. Integral to the project are activities to improve retention in STEM and the diversity of graduates in engineering. The project creates hands-on research experiences and the writing exercises for students enrolled in a multidisciplinary engineering course. It also funds undergraduates to conduct faculty-mentored research, develop and submit NSF graduate research fellowship applications, and present their research at scientific conferences. Finally, the project includes K-12 outreach activities and laboratory tours.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this research is to define the mechanisms that control collagen crosslinking enzyme production by cells. Adult stem cells and tendon cells isolated from developing rat tendons associated with high forces, the Achilles tendon, and low forces, the tail tendon, will be evaluated in culture as model systems to determine if these cell populations have unique control mechanisms. To test mechanically responsive pathways that regulate collagen crosslinking enzyme production, cells will be exposed to a range of mechanical stimuli using a bioreactor and treated with targeted cell signaling pathway inhibitors. The role of biological signaling in enzyme production will be evaluated using different biochemical growth factors that are known to impact tendon growth and injury, while conducting cell signaling pathway inhibition and analysis.

The resulting tools will apply to a wide range of molecules and materials and Van Voorhis will specifically use these tools to study fuel cell catalysts. Computational tools have revolutionized chemistry in recent decades and the work in this proposal will train part of the next generation of computer-savvy chemists. As part of the proposal, Van Voorhis will engage in activities aimed at improving women and under-represented minorities pursuing careers in science. <br/><br/>In this project, we will develop new quantum mechanical fragment embedding tools that are specifically designed to be able to accurately treat both complex molecules and solids. The starting point for the work is Bootstrap Embedding (BE), a method that fundamentally solves the issue of embedding overlapping fragments. In this project, we will extend BE by while improving its accuracy and efficiency in treating large basis sets and intermolecular interactions. In a parallel effort, we will implement BE for extended systems (e.g. surfaces and solids) by incorporating periodic boundary conditions. The bootstrap conditions also naturally lead to a new form of boundary conditions (which we call ?impurity boundary conditions?) that approximate the situation in which a single substrate reacts at a semi-infinite surface. As a signature application of these tools, we will study the energetics of O2 binding and subsequent proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps in a set of potential ORR catalysts. As the ORR half-reaction is the rate- and potential- determining step in all modern fuel cells, advances in this area have the potential for significant impacts in future fuel cell technologies.

It will promote the advancement of science and strengthen our national capabilities for manufacturing of advanced optical systems. Ultra-precision machines utilize single crystal diamond tools to manufacture optics with dimensional accuracies that are on the order of a small fraction of the diameter of a human hair, approximately one ten-millionth of one meter.  New ultra-precision machine technology enables the manufacture of optics of nearly arbitrary shape, known as freeform optics.  This freedom allows optics designers to think in entirely new ways.  As one of the enabling technologies for freeform optics, ultra-precision machining is poised to play a major role in an optical revolution.  A prime application area of this technology is the manufacture of optics for thermal imaging and night vision systems. This award supports fundamental research needed for the cost-effective manufacture of freeform optics.  While the immediate impact area is thermal imaging, the research has broader application to many industry sectors critical to the U.S. economic sectors including solar energy, healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, defense and automotive.  This research crosses the disciplines of manufacturing, mechanical engineering, materials science and optical science and the multi-disciplinary approach is used to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/><br/>The research objective of this researched study is to test the hypothesis that there is a shift in material removal mechanism at increased cutting velocities when single point diamond machining brittle single crystal materials such as germanium or silicon. Ultra-precision diamond machining experiments will be performed at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that are designed to explore the effect of increased cutting velocities on the governing cutting mechanics. The study will focus on 1) high speed diamond flycutting, 2) high speed orthogonal cutting using a fast tool servo to allow rapid tool withdrawal from the cut, and 3) ohmic contact cutting to explore the possibility of a material phase change. High bandwidth dynamic forces, chip morphology and changes in material phase, if any, will be quantified. The surface and subsurface of the machined specimens will be characterized by atomic force microscopy, channeling Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy to be performed at Oklahoma State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been used to identify regions of the genome associated with common diseases and disorders.  However, genetic variants identified through these approaches usually explain only a small fraction of their known heritability and have yielded a poor record of finding disease-causing variants. This project will develop tools to combine GWAS with other sources of data, such as family-based genetic studies that identify important rare variants and transcriptomic or proteomic studies that capture gene expression signatures in disease, to find genetic modifiers that would be entirely missed using GWAS alone.<br/><br/>This project will identify genes involved in disease progression by combining information across different experimental types. The fundamental building block of the family of statistical models that will be employed is a hierarchical three-group mixture of distributions. Each gene is modeled probabilistically as belonging to either a null group that is unassociated with disease progression, a deleterious group that is associated with negative disease outcomes, or a beneficial group that is associated with positive disease outcomes. This three-group formalism has two key features. First, by apportioning prior probability of group assignments with a Dirichlet distribution, the resultant posterior group probabilities automatically account for the multiplicity inherent in analyzing many genes simultaneously. Second, by building models for experimental outcomes conditionally on the group labels, any number of data modalities may be combined in a single coherent probability model, allowing information sharing across experiment types. These two features result in parsimonious inference with few false positives, while simultaneously enhancing power to detect signals.  The model disease for applying the combined analysis approach will be Parkinson?s Disease (PD). Genomic sequences from PD and control patients will be jointly analyzed along with transcriptomic data from public sources and targeted single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data.  In addition, a powerful imaging approach called robotic microscopy (RM) will be used to functionally evaluate the predictions of the statistical model thereby providing experimental feedback to the model. Using human neurons derived from PD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (i-neurons) and RM, levels of genes predicted to be beneficial or deleterious will be modulated in the PD i-neurons, and mitigation or exacerbation of disease phenotypes will be quantified to validate or invalidate predictions of the statistical model.  The strategy of combining genomic, transcriptomic, phenotypic, and potentially other sources of information using the three-groups framework can be applied to any heritable disease with multiple data types available.  The analytical approach in this project will help identify which genes are likely to play a role in pathogenesis, resulting in therapeutic targets and potentially individualized ""precision medicine"".  This could lead directly to treatments for PD, and in addition could provide a useful set of tools for other researchers to pursue therapies for other heritable diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deployable underground structures are ones that change size or shape after being installed under the ground. This allows for larger foundation capacities to be achieved with less installation effort and cost. Using deployable mechanisms to increase foundation capacity is a novel concept for geostructures since these mechanisms have only been utilized in aerospace and over-ground applications. More specifically, this research focuses on deployable underground structures with awns that increase their size underground once they are installed. The idea can be applied to foundation piles for offshore wave and wind energy converters, land-based wind turbines, and tall buildings. Future advances from this research will enable increased sustainability of geostructures to create systems that uses less material and have better packing for transportation while maintaining the required load carrying capacity. Furthermore, in this project advanced visualization techniques such as virtual reality will be used to develop outreach tools that introduce students to concepts of structural deployment and advanced soil-structure interaction.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to unlock this fundamental concept of underground awn deployment by gaining the fundamental physical insight required to mechanistically describe the soil-structure interactions occurring during the deployment process. The grand challenges addressed are to 1) understand soil-structure interaction of deployable, compliant structures and 2) demonstrate underground structural system deployment using an awn arrangement that enhances system foundation capacity. Development of form-finding methods with load-transfer informed soil-structure hybrid models in combination with statistical uncertainty analysis for health diagnostics will be used to advance the knowledge base on nonlinear soil-structure interaction. This work will also advance scientific knowledge on structural analysis for deployable structures and computational modeling for soil-structure interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference will serve as a forum for uniting communities of investigators to discuss, compare, and contrast various aspects of amphibian and reptile diseases. To this end, this meeting will include, but will not be limited to virologists, mycologists, parasitologists, veterinarians, immunologists, ecologists, and pathologists. Dealing with the impacts of infectious diseases plaguing amphibians and reptiles requires a more comprehensive understanding of the replication, transmission, and epidemiology of these pathogens, the molecular bases underlying pathogenicity, and the roles of host immune systems during such infections. Concurrently, greater insight into these diseases and their resulting outcomes require in-depth knowledge of pathogen ecology, specifically addressing issues of host range, host-pathogen interactions, and the myriad environmental factors, such as climate, altitude, ultraviolet exposure, agrochemicals, and anthropomorphic changes, that impact host susceptibility and resistance. As such, the 2022 GARD meeting will provide an opportunity for scientists studying the many different facets of herpetological diseases to combine their respective areas of expertise and thus raise the level of global awareness and understanding of infectious disease impacting amphibians and reptiles.<br/><br/>The overarching goal unifying the participants of the first Global Amphibian and Reptile Disease Conference is to diminish the loss of amphibian and reptile diversity by advancing our understanding of the principal agents contributing to diseases of these animals and developing mitigation strategies to control them. To accomplish that goal, this conference will improve scientific communication among investigators whose diverse interests often find them attending different meetings. The 2022 GARD meeting will also engage junior researchers through comprehensive workshops and presentations that prominently feature research from students, postdoctoral fellows, and research associates. Through outreach programs offered by the universities whose faculty are in attendance, we will facilitate participation by students from under-represented minorities, thereby integrating them into our scientific communities. Moreover, the hands-on training that students, postdoctoral fellows, and principal investigators will acquire through workshops and field trips offered at GARD 2022, will enhance their respective research endeavors, advance their studies of amphibian and reptile diseases, and strengthen STEM research in general.

Additionally, perovskites are deposited from solution, meaning that they can be deposited on virtually any substrate, including silicon. However, the slow operation speed of PeLEDs limits their potential for a wider scope of applications, such as interchip and intrachip optical communications, which are dominated by more expensive technologies using III-V semiconductors. In this project, the PI proposes to study transient charge-carrier dynamics of PeLEDs under ultrashort electrical excitation. If successful, the proposed investigation will advance the understanding of the intrinsic speed limitations in these materials, and can begin in earnest for less well developed aspects of halide perovskite optoelectronic applications, such as in optical communications integrated on-chip. Currently, such applications are restricted due to unknowns regarding perovskite LED switching speeds, and this proposed project will fill these knowledge gaps. The research will strengthen technological leadership of the U.S. and prepare the next generation of STEM graduates, including women and underrepresented groups, to follow a STEM career. The PI will continue to engage with the public and students, and is particularly involved in active learning activities to establish role models across generational gaps. At the undergraduate and graduate level, the PI will, via lectures, practical labs, research and courses, stress applications and the benefits of science on society and include guest lectures in order to inspire a new generation of STEM students and allow students to see the rewards of a STEM career.<br/><br/>Probing transient charge-carrier dynamics in real devices is important to understand their operation mechanisms. However, reported studies on charge-carrier dynamics so far, as far as can be understood, have been constrained by optical pumping. No studies have ever been conducted to probe the transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, which is closer to the real device operation conditions. On the other hand, electrical excitation is considerably distinct from optical pumping, and this likely is due to interface or bulk electrochemical processes that couple transport equations with chemical processes. The proposed study will investigate transient charge-carrier dynamics of PeLEDs under ultrashort electrical excitation and investigate how additional electrochemical processes will cause the differences between optical and electrical pumping with respect to recombination processes. Then, the PI will investigate and understand how the various perovskite compositions will influence the transient charge-carrier dynamics under electrical pumping, and disclose dominant factors governing the transient device response and make faster PeLEDs possible. Two scientific goals that will allow for future applications are: 1) advancing the understanding of the intrinsic speed limitations in PeLEDs; 2) a better appreciation for differences between optical and electrical pumping with respect to recombination processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By comparison to land ice, sea ice surface biogeochemistry has been largely ignored. One reason is due to the relative inaccessibility of impurity-laden sea ice. The presence of these particles, such as black carbon and dust, lowers the surface albedo, resulting in increased solar absorption that quickly thins the impurity-laden ice. Deposition of black carbon onto Arctic sea ice is likely growing due to the increasing frequency and severity of fires in the Arctic. Additionally, thawing permafrost may be increasing dust deposition onto nearby sea ice. The increased absorption of solar radiation by the light absorbing particles also increases meltwater generation and melt-pond formation. As a result, physical access to sampling impurities on sea ice is limited due to unsafe physical ice conditions. This award supports development of an integrated unmanned aerial system (UAS) capable of taking off from a ship-based platform, imaging the surface of the sea ice to locate ideal sampling locations, and autonomously retrieving snow samples that would otherwise be unreachable. Students are engaged throughout this project via the Colorado Space Grant Consortium.  <br/><br/>The scale of impurity-laden sea ice is currently unknown and is not accounted for in global climate models. Sediment-laden ice and other impurities have a profound impact on sea ice biota and can delay or inhibit the timing of the spring phytoplankton and ice algae bloom, thereby impacting the entire marine ecosystem. Given that these localized albedo responses and feedbacks lead to regional impacts on the Arctic surface energy balance, climate, and ocean primary productivity, it will have repercussions for the global climate as well. The impurity-ice albedo feedbacks also thin the sea ice, limiting physical sampling due to unsafe ice conditions. Therefore, field sampling of snow and ice surface biogeochemistry will be transformed by developing a robotic sampling device affixed to an UAS, together with a hyperspectral remote sensing imager. The rapid collection of useful spectral information will help document the impact impurity-laden ice has on sea ice albedo and the robotic arm will increase the spatial and temporal frequency of ground-based observations from normally inaccessible floes. This new integrated UAS will be tested in the Pacific Northwest and on sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and will have broad applications for use in other regions of the cryosphere, such as heavily crevassed glaciers and ice sheets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, particulate fouling significantly reduces the efficiency and prevents optimization and full utilization of such systems. Several studies have shown that particulate fouling significantly contributes to global CO2 anthropogenic emissions. To date, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of this phenomenon. Therefore, the overriding aim of this project is to identify and understand major underlying mechanisms of the deposition process using high-fidelity numerical simulations using state-of-the-art techniques for turbulent wall-bounded dispersed flows at moderate/high Reynolds numbers, as detailed experimental measurements are not currently possible. The project also includes relevant educational activities that help increase the readiness of K-12 students for college education by addressing the shortage of adequately trained high school teachers. <br/><br/>The research aims to take a foundational step to address the existing lack of fundamental knowledge on characteristics of turbulent dispersed flows of small particles at high Reynolds numbers. The proposed research leverages an advanced and accurate Euler-Lagrangian approach, i.e., Point-Particle Direct Numerical Simulation (PP-DNS) via one-way coupling, to gain fundamental insights into the complex dynamics of small particles dispersion and deposition inside highly turbulent wall-bounded flows and to use this knowledge to guide the development and validation of first generation of reliable and computationally affordable modelling framework. Particular focus will be on a Point-Particle based Euler-Lagrangian framework that uses an advanced turbulence modeling strategy i.e., hybrid Unsteady Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation methodology to capture complex dynamics of the fluid phase. The resulting framework provides a unique tool to study and understand small particle transport and deposition dynamics in high Reynolds number turbulent flows that otherwise would not be possible and yet, essential for an optimized design of Thermo-Fluid systems. Further, the current study will cover particles in a size range that encompasses typical size range most responsible for particulate fouling in majority of emerging technologies. Finally, the knowledge on dispersion and deposition of small particles is expected to serve as a bridge to combine fluid dynamics and virology to help understand transmission of deadly viruses such as COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deployable underground structures are ones that change size or shape after being installed under the ground. This allows for larger foundation capacities to be achieved with less installation effort and cost. Using deployable mechanisms to increase foundation capacity is a novel concept for geostructures since these mechanisms have only been utilized in aerospace and over-ground applications. More specifically, this research focuses on deployable underground structures with awns that increase their size underground once they are installed. The idea can be applied to foundation piles for offshore wave and wind energy converters, land-based wind turbines, and tall buildings. Future advances from this research will enable increased sustainability of geostructures to create systems that uses less material and have better packing for transportation while maintaining the required load carrying capacity. Furthermore, in this project advanced visualization techniques such as virtual reality will be used to develop outreach tools that introduce students to concepts of structural deployment and advanced soil-structure interaction.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to unlock this fundamental concept of underground awn deployment by gaining the fundamental physical insight required to mechanistically describe the soil-structure interactions occurring during the deployment process. The grand challenges addressed are to 1) understand soil-structure interaction of deployable, compliant structures and 2) demonstrate underground structural system deployment using an awn arrangement that enhances system foundation capacity. Development form-finding methods with load-transfer informed soil-structure hybrid models in combination with statistical uncertainty analysis for health diagnostics will be used to advance the knowledge base on nonlinear soil-structure interaction. This work will also advance scientific knowledge on structural analysis for deployable structures and computational modeling for soil-structure interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FA tools are designed to discover meaningful latent information from data (e.g., prominent topics in a collection of documents) in an unsupervised manner. However, classic FA models do not consider unknown nonlinear distortions that often happen in data acquisition/generation, and thus frequently fail to produce sensible results in critical scenarios. This project will develop a suite of nonlinear factor analysis (NFA) tools that will transform existing FA paradigms by effectively and provably handling unknown nonlinearities. Results from this project will significantly advance the understanding of fundamental properties and computational aspects of various NFA models, including model identifiability, sample complexity, noise robustness and algorithm convergence---which are largely uncharted research territories. The products will boost the performance of a broad spectrum of sensing and learning tasks in science and engineering where unknown nonlinear distortions often arise, e.g., remote sensing, brain-computer interface, vision/image/text data analytics, bioinformatics, geoscience, biology, and ecology. The integrated education plan of developing visually appealing FA and NFA-based course modules and software will alleviate ?math anxiety? in K-12 and college. The precollege outreach programs and undergraduate research plans will effectively foster early interest in mathematics and enhance students? participation in STEM disciplines. These education activities will lead to a mathematically competitive future workforce for signal and machine intelligence.<br/><br/>This project will develop a unified analytical and computational framework for learning various challenging and realistic NFA models. Specifically, Thrust I will develop a unified functional equation-based framework for provable unsupervised nonlinear model identification under various NFA settings. Thrust II will make important advances towards understanding NFA under realistic conditions (e.g., finite sample and noisy cases), and will offer effective NFA optimization algorithms with performance guarantees. Thrust III will carefully evaluate the proposed approaches over timely and important sensing and learning tasks including hyperspectral imaging, biosensor signal processing, and unsupervised machine learning. These thrusts will produce fundamental results in both theory and algorithms addressing critical challenges in NFA. The new functional equation-based analytical framework offers a theoretical underpinning for various NFA model identification problems that are beyond the reach of existing tools. The new NFA performance characterization tools under realistic settings (e.g., finite data) will be a substantial leap forward from existing works that all use overly ideal assumptions (e.g., unlimited data). The computational framework through an integration of statistical analysis, neural network learning, and nonlinear programming will offer provable and flexible algorithms for NFA problems, which all currently lack guaranteed solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three main sources of net primary production (NPP) have been identified in the Arctic Ocean that differ primarily in their timing and location within the water column. These include (1) single-celled microalgae growing within the sea ice, (2) phytoplankton that bloom in water under the sea ice (UIB), and (3) phytoplankton that bloom in open water, including in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and at the depth of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). Increasing our knowledge of the relative rates of NPP and particle export efficiency from these three systems is critical if we are to understand how continued sea ice loss, and the associated shifts in ice algal and phytoplankton bloom dynamics, will differentially impact benthic and pelagic food webs in shallow seas throughout the Arctic Ocean, including many organisms on which Indigenous human populations rely. The particle flux aspects of this proposal could be truly transformative. We know very little about the relative carbon fluxes from sea ice, UIBs, and open water phytoplankton blooms and virtually nothing about the processes that control those fluxes. Our ability to characterize, for the first time, buoyancy regulation by individual members of each of these three critical microalgal communities will shed new light on how these organic matter fluxes vary as a function of algal cell size, taxonomy, and physiological state, as well as environmental conditions. This information will contribute greatly to the foundation of knowledge needed to understand potentially significant ecosystem changes, both now and in the future. Furthermore, the project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups through participation in Stanford University?s Summer Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) program. The Arrigo lab also takes part in Stanford?s School of Earth Sciences high school internship program. Results of this work will be integrated into lecture and laboratory classes at Stanford exploring the effect of UIBs on the biology and biogeochemistry of the Arctic Ocean. Finally, this project will contribute to the education and training of two Ph.D. students (one female African American) and one post-doc. Training of undergraduates will be an integral part of this project, and we expect 4-6 to participate in this cruise.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Detailed observations of microalgal blooms in the Chukchi Sea have been largely made at a time of year when most of the Chukchi shelf is already in open water. As such, the relative rates of daily net primary production (NPP) by sea ice microalgae, under-ice phytoplankton blooms (UIBs), and open water phytoplankton blooms are not well known. Additionally, the fate of the organic matter associated with these three NPP sources is poorly known. Hence, there is a strong need for comprehensive measurements beginning in late spring that capture all three blooms, with particular emphasis on particle export events. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to utilize data obtained from a ship-based field program to the Chukchi Sea to 1) measure rates of NPP associated with the sea ice, UIBs, and open water phytoplankton in both the MIZ and SCM, 2) use sediment traps to characterize and quantify the vertical sinking fluxes of bulk particulate matter from the sea ice, UIBs, and open water phytoplankton blooms, and 3) use our newly developed Hydrodynamic treadmill to determine how sinking speeds of microalgae from all three NPP sources vary by community composition, physiological state, and environmental condition. The centerpiece of our proposed program is a 45-day process study cruise that will take place in June 2023. The cruise will consist of a series of hydrographic surveys/sections that will repeatedly transition between the deep ice pack and the marginal ice zone. 150 hydrographic survey (HS) stations will include vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, currents, light, nutrients, and Chl a concentration. At 90 of these (referred to as biological sampling (BS) stations), we will also collect samples to measure algal and zooplankton abundance/species/size (the latter using the underwater vision profiler, UVP), algal physiology, NPP, POC, particle sinking speeds (Hydrodynamic treadmill), deploy a Haps corer to measure sediment Chl a, and deploy sediment traps to measure vertical fluxes of ice algae, phytoplankton, detritus, and fecal pellets (at 1/3 of the BS stations). During transits, we will continuously measure atmospheric conditions as well as sea surface temperature, salinity, and Chl a fluorescence from the various ship?s systems to provide detailed maps of these parameters above and below the ice. About every second day, we will conduct a 6-hour sea ice (SI) station near solar noon where we will measure the physical, chemical, and biological properties (see above) of the ice pack and underlying surface water, as well as deploy sediment traps to measure sinking fluxes of algae, detritus, and fecal pellets from the sea ice and from the UIB. The ship will also be used as a platform for characterizing buoyancy regulation and measuring sinking speeds of microalgal cells and aggregates under various manipulated environmental conditions using the Hydrodynamic treadmill. This instrument provides unlimited scope for active vertical tracking of particles (scale-free), while concurrently providing micron and millisecond-scale spatiotemporal resolution. The Hydrodynamic treadmill also directly measures the flow field around the diatom to measure any bound matrix materials (not visible optically) associated with a single cell and can provide estimates of particle porosity and density. At each BS and SI station, measurements of sinking speed will be combined with detailed analyses of algal taxonomic composition, physiology, and size structure, as well as environmental characteristics (e.g., light, temperature, nutrients) to determine functional relationships and assess the relative importance of each of the three primary bloom communities to sinking particle fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By comparison to land ice, sea ice surface biogeochemistry has been largely ignored. One reason is due to the relative inaccessibility of impurity-laden sea ice. The presence of these particles, such as black carbon and dust, lowers the surface albedo, resulting in increased solar absorption that quickly thins the impurity-laden ice. Deposition of black carbon onto Arctic sea ice is likely growing due to the increasing frequency and severity of fires in the Arctic. Additionally, thawing permafrost may be increasing dust deposition onto nearby sea ice. The increased absorption of solar radiation by the light absorbing particles also increases meltwater generation and melt-pond formation. As a result, physical access to sampling impurities on sea ice is limited due to unsafe physical ice conditions. This award supports development of an integrated unmanned aerial system (UAS) capable of taking off from a ship-based platform, imaging the surface of the sea ice to locate ideal sampling locations, and autonomously retrieving snow samples that would otherwise be unreachable. Students are engaged throughout this project via the Colorado Space Grant Consortium.  <br/><br/>The scale of impurity-laden sea ice is currently unknown and is not accounted for in global climate models. Sediment-laden ice and other impurities have a profound impact on sea ice biota and can delay or inhibit the timing of the spring phytoplankton and ice algae bloom, thereby impacting the entire marine ecosystem. Given that these localized albedo responses and feedbacks lead to regional impacts on the Arctic surface energy balance, climate, and ocean primary productivity, it will have repercussions for the global climate as well. The impurity-ice albedo feedbacks also thin the sea ice, limiting physical sampling due to unsafe ice conditions. Therefore, field sampling of snow and ice surface biogeochemistry will be transformed by developing a robotic sampling device affixed to an UAS, together with a hyperspectral remote sensing imager. The rapid collection of useful spectral information will help document the impact impurity-laden ice has on sea ice albedo and the robotic arm will increase the spatial and temporal frequency of ground-based observations from normally inaccessible floes. This new integrated UAS will be tested in the Pacific Northwest and on sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and will have broad applications for use in other regions of the cryosphere, such as heavily crevassed glaciers and ice sheets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These methods are expected to provide highly accurate data for this important electronic property of chiral materials, with a twofold goal: to understand the elusive effect of intermolecular interactions on this property, and to benchmark and improve approximate but computationally efficient methods. Caricato will also develop interpretative tools for structure-property relations that may help define design principles for materials with desired features. These tools will be used to develop reduced-scaling strategies to increase computational efficiency. The broader impact of this proposal hinges on the use of computational chemistry to benefit society both in terms of technological advances and educational opportunities. A deeper understanding of the chiral response of a material may lead to design principles for the rational design of materials with desired properties for targeted applications in growing research fields such as chiral sensing and electronics. Caricato will also develop an outreach initiative to exploit the enormous potential of quantum chemistry simulations for high school education. In collaboration with local high school teachers, Caricato will develop educational modules where the students actively run the simulations and analyze the results. This initiative will hopefully stimulate the enthusiasm for science of high school students in rural and economically disadvantaged areas of the state of Kansas,  and inspire them to pursue further training in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines. <br/><br/>Under this award, the Caricato team will develop linear response-periodic coupled cluster (LR-PCC) methods for crystalline solids, and a tensor decomposition analysis useful for data interpretation as well as computational cost reduction. Although density functional theory (DFT) methods still represent a great compromise between cost and accuracy for solid state calculations, they still suffer from the same drawbacks as for molecules: the quality of the results is system-dependent and individual functionals are not systematically improvable. Particularly problematic is the description of intermolecular interactions, which are fundamental for the overall optical response of a chiral system in the condensed phase. The proposed LR-PCC methods will provide accurate data on the role of intermolecular interactions on the optical activity of solids as well as benchmarking data for the development of functionals and basis sets tailored for this property. At the same time, new approaches for qualitative analysis of the relevant tensors will be developed that may help unravel the elusive structure-property relations in optically active materials. These approaches will be also used to devise reduced-scaling techniques to increase the computational efficiency of the algorithms.

One of the reasons that dust is so abundant is that it has increased substantially, perhaps even doubled, since the Industrial Revolution. This large increase is probably because of human actions like clearing land for agriculture. Surprisingly, the impact of the increasing desert dust on the climate system has remained mysterious. In fact, it is still an open question whether this historical increase in dust has contributed to or counteracted greenhouse gas warming of the climate system. This project will answer this question by (i) determining the change in Earth?s energy budget produced by the scattering and absorbing of solar and terrestrial radiation by dust, (ii) determining the amount by which dust has increased since the Industrial Revolution, and (iii) determining the resultant change in Earth?s energy budget from the increase in dust. These goals will be achieved by combining satellite observations, aircraft measurements, numerous records of how deposition of desert dust has changed across the world, and numerical simulations of how dust affects Earth?s radiation budget. The research will be performed by a team of scientists that include undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>Determining the climate impact of the historical increase in desert dust is important because calculations of how sensitive the climate system is to greenhouse warming depend on the extent to which greenhouse warming has been counteracted by cooling produced by particulate matter like dust. This project will thus result in more accurate predictions of the climate changes produced by future increases in greenhouse gases, which is critical to an effective societal response to those changes.

As such, biological rhythms are a core component on life on Earth, and run the gamut from oscillations occurring on the scale of seconds, and those on the scale of the seasons. The study of biological rhythms over the past century has led to the discovery of an exquisite cellular and molecular timekeeping system, which impacts everything from physiology to behavior. Indeed, in 2017 a group of pioneers in our field were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their groundbreaking work unravelling this molecular puzzle. While biological clocks are a fundamental aspect of life, their effects on a wide range of biological processes are finally being appreciated. Our growing understanding of how biological rhythms impact many areas of the life sciences is starting to inform how we think about public health, labor and education systems, and the consequences of the built environment. The objective of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR) 2022 meeting is to foster discussion from ?molecule to policy?, and highlight the groundbreaking work of both senior and junior scientists. The activity includes expansion of the mentoring and training efforts that SRBR has worked hard to establish. Emphasis is placed on recruitment and retention of members from underrepresented minority populations and increasing the diversity of our community. <br/><br/>Collaboration between experts in biological timing and other scientists, engineers, and policy makers is critical to increase awareness of the global impact of biological rhythms. The theme for the 2022 SRBR meeting, ?From Molecule to Policy?, will directly embrace this challenge. Comparative approaches are a critical component of this meeting, with inclusion of both model and non-model organisms, as well as both laboratory and field studies, in microbes, plants, humans and in non-human animals. The program includes topics such as the neural networks of timekeeping, rhythms in bacteria and microbes, mathematical models of oscillatory systems, analysis strategies for rhythms in ?Big Data?, chronotherapeutics, effects of rhythms on metabolism, and even the intersection of biological rhythms and the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific program is inclusive, diverse, and timely. SRBR 2022 fosters and strives to maintain a diverse and inclusive scientific community. A key component of this proposal is the support of the day-long Trainee and Professional Development event, which includes dozens of formal workshops and training events targeted at trainees and junior faculty. In addition to formal and informal mentoring and training events during the conference, this day-long event sets the stage for trainees? active participation in the meeting. SRBR 2022 promotes increased attendance of underrepresented groups and researchers from low-income countries through a variety of awards and fellowships, with the goal of increasing participation as well as improving retention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, ""switchable"" multiferroics are materials that have distinct elastic, electric, and/or magnetic properties that can be reversibly ""switched on or off"" by inducing martensitic phase transformations. Switchable multiferroics have inspired novel energy conversion, energy harvesting, and actuator technologies, but hysteresis (loss of work capacity) and functional fatigue or failure remain major barriers for the cycle lifetime demands of these technologies. The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of mechanical hysteresis and functional fatigue in these materials through multiscale, multimodal in-situ experimentation. The award will also launch a comprehensive education and outreach platform with two main thrusts: (1) interactive extended reality (XR) learning tools for undergraduate and graduate courses as well as dissemination of research, and (2) hands-on demos on concepts of physics/mechanics for public outreach. These demos will also be used in workshops for underrepresented K?12 students through a Detroit-based summer camp.<br/><br/>Martensitic phase transformations are the enabling mechanism behind the advanced performances of many diverse materials including ""switchable"" multiferroics, steels, elastomers, high entropy alloys, superconductors, and many materials at high strain rates. Due to the complexities of martensitic phase transformations, understanding these behaviors is a significant scientific challenge, and the hysteresis and functional fatigue associated with reversible martensitic transformations remain major technological barriers. The objective of this work is to understand mechanical hysteresis and functional fatigue by investigating the cyclic activation and propagation of martensitic microstructures. The approach is to resolve the hierarchical nature of the underlying micromechanics in situ, in 3D, and across five orders of magnitude in length scale, from the motion of the individual interfaces to the aggregate behavior of hundreds of grains. This multiscale approach will be achieved using multimodal 3D/4D in-situ characterization with dark-field X-ray microscopy, X-ray topo-tomography, and high-energy diffraction microscopy on magnesium-scandium shape memory alloys. The expected outcome is a new framework for understanding the mechanics of martensitic phase transforming materials that emerges from a multiscale understanding of stress-activated habit plane variant selection, incorporates the important role of defects, interfacial stress fields, and microstructural repeatability, and has broad implications for imperative cross¬cutting micromechanics challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During organ formation, cells on a flat sheet change their shapes and positions to form a three-dimensional tube.  The cellular forces driving such cell shape changes and rearrangement are generated by cytoskeletal proteins that act like motors moving along protein-based filaments. Therefore, determining the regulatory mechanisms of the cytoskeletal protein networks is essential to understanding how organs form a proper shape.  Using the developing salivary glands of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, this research will fill the gap in our knowledge of the signaling pathway that controls dynamic cytoskeletal networks during tube formation.  A postdoctoral researcher and graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will be trained in techniques of genetic manipulations, advanced microscopy, and biochemical and cellular assays.  Scientific outreach programs, such as the Student Research Mentorship Program, will encourage local middle school students to learn about organ formation during development and promote critical thinking and testing hypotheses. Presentations to the public will be given on organ formation and human diseases linked to defects in malformed tubular organs.<br/><br/>Contractile actomyosin structures are created or polarized in response to cell-cell signaling and regulated by localized activation of RhoA GTPase.  The overall goal of this research is to define better how signaling at the cell surface by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) directs RhoA function to precisely control epithelial tube formation.  Conceptually, this project will 1) fill out the gap in our knowledge of the signaling pathway by identifying and characterizing unidentified salivary gland GPCRs that reorganize actomyosin networks; 2) reveal the role of new key components in activation of Rho signaling during epithelial tube formation; 3) discover the mechanisms of how GPCR-Rho signaling organizes cortical actin during tissue invagination.  By combining genetics, immunohistochemistry, confocal and super-resolution imaging, timelapse live imaging, computational image analysis, and biochemical approaches, this research will help us understand how dynamic cellular behaviors result in precise changes in tubular organ formation.  The resulting data, methods, and findings will be broadly distributed.

Relational organizing involves enlisting motivated volunteers to share information about and encourage others they know to engage in a desired behavior. It is effective because it harnesses the power of people?s social connections, which people are generally motivated to maintain, to help spread new information and create new social norms. Although a growing number of studies have documented the effectiveness of relational organizing, a key challenge to implementing this approach is scaling it up, or encouraging a larger number of individuals to reach out to others they know. Studies find that most people who are committed to participating in a conservation behavior in their personal lives are reluctant to reach out to others about this behavior. Preliminary research suggests this may be a result of specific social-psychological barriers that prevent people from reaching out to others, such as their fear of being judged negatively. This project examines these barriers through public surveys, and develops and experimentally tests messaging approaches for reducing these barriers to encourage greater participation in relational organizing. To do so, the researchers partner with an international NGO, local government, and private industry to focus on a context with immense environmental, health, and animal welfare impacts: relational organizing to reduce meat consumption. The team develops practical handbooks and webinars summarizing the findings to inform the efforts of numerous organizations seeking to harness the power of relational organizing for pro-social behavior. <br/><br/>Scaling up the relational organizing approach requires understanding, synthesizing, and developing interventions to address the most salient factors driving people?s willingness to reach out to others. The researchers advance a theoretical model of the social-psychological drivers of participation in relational organizing. The model proposes that participation in relational organizing is influenced by: 1) personal norms about reaching out to others; 2) activist social identity; 3) attitudes towards and past engagement in the target behavior; 4) perceptions of others? beliefs about the issue and about reaching out to others about the issue; and 5) beliefs about the efficacy of relational organizing. To test this model, the team first conducts surveys to examine the explanatory power of the model and identify the social-psychological variables that are most associated with participation in relational organizing for reducing meat consumption. The results of the surveys inform the development of messaging interventions to address the most important social-psychological factors. The team tests the effectiveness of the messaging interventions at enhancing relational organizing for reducing meat consumption first through online experiments and then through field experiments in collaboration with an international NGO, local government, and private sector partners. In the field experiments, they track vouchers for meatless meals that respondents can give to others as indicators of effective relational organizing.<br/> <br/>The research addresses three gaps in the literature on pro-environmental and pro-social behavior. First, most studies have focused on motivating personal-sphere behaviors, rather than more collective behaviors that involve engaging with others. The team addresses this gap through the focus on motivating individuals to reach out to others to facilitate relational organizing. Second, there is a lack of understanding of the diversity and relative importance of social-psychological factors influencing whether people reach out to others in their social network. This gap is addressed through the development and testing of the theoretical model. Finally, few studies have tested the impacts of theory-based interventions on real-world indicators of conservation behavior, particularly on collective behaviors related to biodiversity conservation and food choices. This project addresses this gap through a field experiment that implements a real-world relational organizing campaign.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As oceans absorb heat, its oxygen content is expected to decline which will affect marine ecosystems and oxygen-sensitive biochemical reactions. In turn, biochemical processes can affect the oxygen level.  Understanding why oceanic oxygen changes remains limited due to sparse data and the fact that it naturally fluctuates. Furthermore, state-of-the-art Earth System Models, used to develop future projections, struggle to skillfully simulate present-day oxygen distributions. Given model biases, there is a clear need to re-calibrate model-based projections based on informed interpretations of available observations. The intellectual merit of this study is to perform a series of computational simulations to quantify linkages between the patterns of climate variability, ocean heating, and oxygen content for different regions. In conjunction with a novel synthesis of available observational data, this modeling study will develop a more comprehensive model for evaluating oxygen variability and change, thereby reducing uncertainty in future projections under climate forcing scenarios. Broader impacts of this study includes education and outreach about decreasing ocean concentrations in the ocean and its disruptive impacts on ocean biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystems. Two Ph.D. students and a postdoctoral scientist will be trained under the supervision of the PIs. <br/><br/><br/>Ocean deoxygenation is a direct consequence of ocean heat uptake; as ocean waters warm, dissolved oxygen (O2) concentrations decline, with profound influences on marine ecosystem and redox-sensitive biogeochemical cycling. Existing observations are characterized by significant interannual to decadal fluctuations. Natural variability challenges detection and attribution of human-driven trends; however, it can also be interrogated to provide mechanistic insight. State-of-the-art Earth System Models still struggle to skillfully simulate present-day O2 distributions but these models are useful because they invoke mechanistic representations of key processes. The objective of this project is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind interannual and decadal variability of O2 globally and regionally. Low- and high-latitude regions exhibit distinct patterns in dissolved oxygen and ocean heat content. In order to isolate the impact of physical and biological controls on O2 variability, a suite of numerical simulations will be conducted, including some with a global eddy-resolving configuration. Combining observational and model-based analyses will enable quantitative assessments about the relation between ocean heat uptake and deoxygenation, and linkages to climate variability and trends."

One of the broad intellectual challenges driving research in the theory of computation is the following: What underlying mathematical structure (or lack thereof) in a computational problem leads to an efficient algorithm for solving it (or dictates its intractability)?  Algorithms are everywhere in today's world, and understanding their power and limitations is important both for foundational reasons as well as the myriad applications that efficient algorithms empower. Given the vast landscape of problems and possible clever algorithms to solve them, it is simplisic to hope to explain the underpinnings of the easiness/hardness of all problems with a single theory. However, recent progress has led to elegant theories that fully explain the computational complexity of rich classes of problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their variants. In this setting, an efficient algorithm exists precisely when there are non-trivial operations called polymorphisms under which the solution space is closed (this can be interpreted as a discrete analog of convexity that is typically at the heart of tractability of continuous optimization problems). Inspired by the success story for constraint satisfaction, the project will investigate the existence of polymorphic principles in broader contexts --- namely, whether ""interesting"" ways to combine solutions to get new solutions lead to efficient algorithms. The project will enable a cross-fertilization of ideas between the approximation algorithms and optimization literature and the powerful algebraic methods used to study CSPs, and foster enhanced collaborations between these research communities.  Due to its balanced focus on exploratory directions and concrete problems, the project is well-suited for investigation by students, and will actively engage and train graduate as well as undergraduate students. The accompanying educational plan will distill suitable segments of the interplay between polymorphisms and algorithms for inclusion in the theory CS curriculum at various levels.<br/><br/>As a specific thrust, the project will investigate the complexity of promise versions of CSPs, where the algorithm is allowed to find an assignment satisfying relaxed versions of the constraints defining the CSP. The promise CSP framework is very general and captures a rich variety of problems, most notably approximate (hyper)-graph coloring and variants. While polymorphisms of CSPs are closed under composition (and therefore a rich family can be built from a single non-trivial polymorphism), polymorphisms inherently lose this closure under composition in the promise setting. As a result, the study of promise CSPs calls for significant new ideas on both the algorithms and hardness sides. In particular, the research will undertake a combination of two highly successful methodologies, the algebraic approach for CSPs and the probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) based theory for approximation. On the algorithmic front, the research will uncover new algorithms in the presence of rich enough families of polymorphisms. The project will also investigate polymorphic gateways between structure and algorithms in broader contexts, including in fast exponential algorithms where partial polymorphisms govern the (exponential) runtime of algorithms for NP-hard CSPs.

The identity of the initial colonizers of these habitats, subsequent invaders, and the repeatability of this process is important for understanding the establishment of ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. Identifying steps in habitat maturation also shapes conservation strategies for endangered species and rare environments. These processes are virtually unknown in the anchialine ecosystem, which consists of coastal, landlocked bodies of water influenced by fresh and oceanic waters. Anchialine habitats are rare worldwide but are concentrated in Hawaii. Hawaiian anchialine habitats are home to a diverse array of animals, plants, and microbes, many of which are found nowhere else. In 2018 lava flows from the Kilauea volcano created several new anchialine habitats on the east coast of Hawaii, presenting an exceptional chance to examine how ecology emerges in the anchialine ecosystem. The researchers will leverage this opportunity to detail how these unusual habitats change over time. Microbial and animal communities will be characterized as they become established. This research will advance our understanding of the anchialine ecosystem, especially its microbes, which may prove useful for future medical or commercial applications. Underrepresented groups in STEM (including native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders) will take an active role in this research.     <br/><br/>Hundreds of microbial samples will be collected during a time series in anchialine habitats undergoing development. Microbial community structure will be analyzed using DNA sequencing technology. These ?young? communities will be compared to ones previously characterized from other, ?mature? Hawaiian anchialine habitats. This research will address the repeatability of anchialine community formation and whether new habitats are converging on microbial communities similar to those in established habitats. To complement these microbial analyses, presence and abundance of a keystone shrimp species in the new anchialine habitats will also be assessed. Population genomic tools will be used to test the origins of the colonizing shrimp, as the lava flows may have caused local extinctions in this species. Physiological experiments in shrimp will also be performed to examine thermal adaptations stemming from elevated temperatures due to volcanic activity. Because shrimp act as important grazers on the microbial communities, correlations between shrimp abundance and microbial community composition will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims at developing novel computational imaging solutions to facilitate underwater robotic tasks, such as autonomous navigation and in-detail sea floor mapping. The project is expected to produce new imaging systems, scene reconstruction algorithms, and control theories that are tailored for underwater vehicles. The project benefits marine research, oil & gas industry, and the military by developing underwater vision systems that decrease the costs, challenges, and risks associated with ocean exploration.

Recent advances in medical imaging, experimentation, and computational modeling, however, have led to a growing body of evidence linking biomechanics of the human brain with major processes in brain development, disease, and damage. Brain biomechanics establishes a relationship between the brain?s structure, function, and motion using the methods of applied mechanics. This Leading Engineering for America's Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure (LEAP-HI) project combines novel medical imaging methods, image analysis, computational modeling, and mechanical testing to determine the fundamental mechanical properties of living brain tissues and the differences in properties between healthy and diseased tissues, and may enable the early diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and dementia. As such, the project has the potential to reduce the financial burden on society and increase the quality of life for millions of people. Outreach activities in brain mechanics will be provided for underrepresented groups in science and engineering, as well as training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The research will provide a novel platform for investigating the mechanobiology of the human brain in health and disease. The research team will develop a novel approach to merge advanced neuroimaging tools and multi-physics brain modeling into a semi-automated pipeline for the in vivo investigation of brain mechanics. Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging technology merged with automated imaging-modeling integration will be utilized to enable the subject-specific investigation of brain mechanics across disparate spatio-temporal scales. Specifically, ultrahigh resolution mechanical, structural, and connectomic neuroimaging tools will be developed and integrated with automatic brain segmentation and mesh generation for finite element and isogeometric analysis to create multi-scale brain mechanics computer models. These tools will then be utilized to provide an in-depth characterization of the mechanobiochemical response of traumatic brain injury, in decompressive craniectomies for stroke patients, and the coupling between prion-like protein progression and cerebral atrophy in dementia. By developing a pipeline for the creation of personalized, data-driven brain models, the research team will demonstrate the transformative power of combined imaging, modeling, and machine learning techniques towards better understanding, improved treatment, and ultimately preventive medicine for neurological disorders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One important step towards accurate modeling involves determining how much water trees store, and how the amount of stored water varies through time and within tree organs.  Another important step involves determining how stored water, and variations in stored water, affect the physiological behavior of individual trees and larger ecosystems. The investigators in this project will measure the amount of water stored in different organs of trees, determine how long water resides in these organs, and evaluate how long-term stored water affects whole-tree water use. The data collected will reveal novel information about how trees store and manage water, which will ultimately allow prediction of tree water storage and water movement through ecosystems in current and future climates. The study site in Idaho broadly represents many landscapes across the Intermountain West. Results from this study will be shared with local communities in the Snake River Plain region, and activities will involve students and faculty members from Tribal Colleges in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>Most models assume steady-state water flow through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. However, there is substantial storage of water in trees, and the residence times of water inside trees ranges from days to months. The total amount of stored water in trees and broader ecosystems, how long water resides in plants, and the ecohydrological implications of tree water storage are still not completely understood. Characterizing the duration of water storage and its impacts on tree ecohydrology are critical for improving hydrological models.  The data collected in this study will be used to test the hypotheses that: (1) Water is stored in trees for many days, with differences in residence time correlating to species- and size-specific sapwood architecture and water-management strategies; (2) Stored water will buffer declines in water transport as soil moisture availability declines, at daily and seasonal timescales; (3) Inter-species differences in water storage and transport-buffering strategies will translate to differential responses in whole-tree water balance and fluxes due to changing climate in modeled scenarios. The work combines stable isotope tracers (deuterium), gas exchange, and hydraulic functional trait data collected in the field with process- and trait-based modeling to determine residence times of water in tree organs, how trees manage water storage and transport among organs, and how water storage regulates whole-tree water relations at hourly to monthly timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, wireless solutions for industrial automation are based on short-range wireless technologies (e.g., WirelessHART, ISA100). To cover a large area with numerous devices, they form multi-hop mesh networks at the expense of energy, cost, and complexity, posing a big challenge to support the scale and wide-area of today?s IIoT. For example, the East Texas oil-field extends over 74x8 square kilometers requiring tens of thousands of sensors for automated management. Also, in process industries, many silos, tanks, and plants are often positioned far from the center, at inconvenient locations in difficult terrain or offshore. Pipelines can be hundreds of miles long and pass through difficult terrains, making it difficult to monitor gas and chemical leaks in real-time. This project proposes to adopt the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies for industrial automation. Due to long-range, LPWANs can be adopted without complex configuration and at a fraction of costs for wide-area IIoT applications, compared to multi-hop solutions. This project will develop theoretical foundations and systems for enabling industrial automation using LPWANs. Its important findings will be shared with the standards bodies and industries. The developed technologies will be made open-source.<br/><br/><br/>This project will particularly consider LoRa, a leading LPWAN technology. Adopting LoRa for industrial automation poses some evolutionary challenges. The fundamental building blocks of any industrial automation system are feedback control loops that largely rely on real-time communication. Due to severe energy-constraints, LoRa uses a simple media access control protocol that is unsuited for real-time communication. It needs to adopt low duty-cycling in several regions (e.g., Europe). In addition, to optimize performance, industrial automation needs a codesign of real-time scheduling and control. Such a codesign becomes specially challenging in LoRa because it is large-scale and has energy-limitations. This project will address these challenges and make the following contributions: (1) an autonomous real-time scheduling technique and analysis using the demand bound function theory for LoRa; (2) a scalable scheduling-control codesign that jointly and dynamically determines control input and sampling rates; (3) a highly energy-efficient codesign by maximizing the sleeping times of the devices through a combination of self-triggered and even-triggered control adopting state-aware communication; and (4) an evaluation of the results through experiments using industrial process control use-cases on a physical testbed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are fundamental across the sciences, but the mathematics underlying their study is very difficult, many important questions remain open, and new ideas are needed.  A main theme of this project is to use a geometric approach to bring fresh insight to this field.  Recently, the PI and collaborators used techniques from symplectic geometry to settle a longstanding question about certain dynamical systems. They showed that a particular dynamical system would take an infinite amount of energy to produce and used this to establish a new dichotomy in the set of systems: the finite-energy ones, and the rest.  This dichotomy will enable a deeper understanding of the classification of dynamical systems and should allow for the resolution of several questions that have attracted wide interest.  This project involves further research in this direction.  One goal of the project is to find a further dichotomy for the finite-energy systems.  By bringing a geometric approach to bear on questions about dynamical systems that have resisted solution by other methods, the project aims to showcase the power of these kinds of techniques.  At the same time, an idea at the heart of the approach comes from studying when one symplectic shape can be deformed into a subset of another, and research in these directions should deepen our understanding of symplectic geometry.  The project also has a substantial education component.  The PI has previously worked to broaden participation in mathematics, foster equity, and support educational efforts in the field through prison education, research training in geometry at the high school and undergraduate levels, and course design.  The project supports this work and related activities.     <br/><br/>This project involves a series of research investigations touching on the related fields of symplectic dynamics, symplectic embeddings, and continuous symplectic geometry.  The main emphasis is on questions in low dimensions where powerful gauge theoretic techniques are available. The PI and collaborators recently settled the longstanding ""Simplicity Conjecture"" partly by contributing to the theory of periodic Floer homology spectral invariants. The project aims to further develop this theory and solve several longstanding questions; for example, to prove an analogue of the Simplicity Conjecture in higher genus.  The project also aims to clarify the dynamics of Reeb flows, study infinite staircases in symplectic embedding problems, investigate questions about topological symplectic manifolds, and study higher-dimensional symplectic packing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project targets several technical challenges posed by the limited reliability of wireless connections and computational constraints of the edge nodes in distributed learning systems. Overcoming these challenges is vital to the plethora of computation, communication, and coordination tasks required by distributed machine learning at the network edge. Centered on developing innovative edge learning algorithms over wireless MAC channels under the constraints of computing, power, and bandwidth, this project can significantly impact wireless edge learning in a variety of IoT applications, ranging from transportation, safety, and agriculture, to energy efficiency, e-health, and smart infrastructure. The broader impact of this research will also come through many educational opportunities by providing opportunities in STEM to K-12, women, and underrepresented minority students.  <br/><br/><br/>This collaborative project will develop an innovative network architecture for distributed learning over wireless multi-access channels. Specifically, the PIs will take a principled approach to develop an integrated wireless edge learning framework, using both gradient-based methods and also very recent advances in gradient-free, zero-order optimization, while taking into account the constraints in computing, power and bandwidth therein, in a holistic manner. The developed methods will be also extended to the setting of distributed online learning and reinforcement learning under wireless MAC. The PIs will focus on optimizing communication-efficient gradient sparsification based local updates that are communicated within the wireless network under bandwidth constraints; and each sender intelligently carries out transmission power allocation based on learning gradient and channel conditions. One important objective is to develop a novel learning-based framework for efficient wireless channel estimation and update to enable effective power control and learning. The project will devise edge learning algorithms that are robust against wireless channel uncertainty. The team of PIs shall comprehensively investigate the impact of the wireless bandwidth and power constraint on both the accuracy and convergence speed of edge learning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  <br/> <br/>Phosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet). Select high school serving communities traditionally underrepresented in science will be reached through semester-long programs led by SAGANet graduate student mentors and facilitated by the investigators of this project."
