Randall Lee of the University of Houston is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to design and synthesize new organic chemical agents.  A major goal of the proposed research is to tune the chemical composition of thin organic coatings to afford surfaces with compositions that are not found in nature.  Given the unique compositions targeted, the coatings are likely to be extraordinarily non-adhesive and therefore useful for coating not only electronic devices (e.g., ultrathin cell phones, laptops, and flat-screen televisions), but also artificial implants (e.g., heart stents) and nanoparticles for medical applications (e.g., cancer therapy).  During the grant period, the PI seeks to broaden the participation of women and minorities through several educational/outreach activities, including the Welch Summer Scholars program, the UH STEM Center, the NSF-supported Houston Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) program, and visits to campus and research mentoring for local high school students.  <br/><br/>The proposed research seeks to design, synthesize, and utilize multidentate adsorbates for the generation of unnatural ""conflicted"" self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold.  Three systems of current technological interest are emphasized: (1) the design and synthesis of multidentate adsorbates for fabricating highly stable thin-film coatings with uniquely controlled surface composition of chemical entities that are either phase incompatible or structurally dissimilar, for the purpose of generating homogeneously mixed heterogeneous ""conflicted"" interfaces; (2) the use of specifically fluorinated adsorbate molecules to generate nanoscale films having well-defined composition and structure, with an ultimate goal of defining the critical elements (e.g., minimum degree of fluorination) needed to construct organic interfaces with controlled hydrophobicity, anti-adhesiveness, and lubricity; and (3) the generation and study of thin-film architectures, including surface-grafted oligomeric films, in which the terminal functional groups mimic the backbones of industrially relevant polymers, with the goal of evaluating the interfacial properties and reactivity of well-defined polymer surfaces.  Advantages offered by the targeted multidentate adsorbates include films with markedly greater stability than those derived from n-alkanethiols, leading in part to advances in nanoscale lubrication, corrosion resistance, nanoparticle stabilization, and anti-adhesive coatings.  Furthermore, due to the restricted surface mobility of the multidentate adsorbates, mixed monolayers of these adsorbates functionalized with disparate chemical tailgroups offer ""conflicted"" organic nanoscale coatings with tailored chemical heterogeneity and controlled nanoscale roughness."

The University of California San Diego Network Telescope (UCSD-NT) is a unique monitoring system which, for over a decade, has enabled global visibility into Internet behavior that few other data sources can offer.  It has provided relevant data used in a broad set of sub-disciplines in Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) and beyond, from network and systems security and stability, to machine learning and big data processing techniques, and, most recently, for studies of cyberwarfare.  The STARDUST project will help sustain operation and extend the applicability of the UCSD-NT infrastructure.  The stabilized and enhanced infrastructure capabilities will serve a diverse range of academic researchers, the vast majority of whom have no access to any other source of global Internet traffic data.  In addition, the proposed enhancements will support invaluable hands-on experience in operationally relevant network security and traffic analysis research for a wide audience of computer science students.<br/><br/>STARDUST aims at maintaining continued operation of the UCSD-NT infrastructure while maximizing its utility to researchers from various disciplines.  The scope of work includes upgrading and modernizing the current infrastructure to handle the predicted growth in traffic, leveraging virtualization and NSF-funded High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms at the San Diego Supercomputer Center for computational data analysis, and introducing meta-data semantics to simplify many tasks researchers typically want to do with UCSD-NT data.  The proposed modifications will leave researchers more time (and available HPC resources) to focus on their specific scientific questions.  Moreover, the project will forge an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers from the field of computer networks and HPC scientists and engineers to experiment with novel approaches for research on live traffic analysis.  Project results will contribute to advancing knowledge in diverse CISE disciplines, e.g., facilitating the development of efficient strategies for early detection and mitigation of cyber attacks, supporting macroscopic Internet performance and reliability assessments, and opening a new domain for the application of live streaming big data analysis techniques."

Stars like the Sun have a boundary region deep inside called the tachocline, which is thought to be necessary to generate a magnetic field.  The smallest stars lack this boundary, but they can still have strong magnetic fields.  Weber will develop computer models of magnetic activity in M dwarf stars, the smallest, most common stars in our galaxy.  Results from her work will allow astronomers to understand how magnetism emerges in M dwarfs.  Because many M dwarfs host planets, this work might also allow a better understanding of how stellar magnetic activity affects the conditions for life on such planets.  Alongside this research, Weber will present colorful visualizations of her computer models, showing Adler Planetarium visitors how heat and magnetism are created inside a star and how they reach the stellar surface and beyond.  Weber will also develop a science communication program for University of Chicago students.<br/>     <br/>Weber will study the generation and emergence of magnetism in fully convective M dwarfs and in those with an imposed tachocline.   She will produce the first set of simulations that address dynamo action and the rotation-activity correlation for M dwarfs across the partially-to-fully convective transition. The nature of the magnetism generated will inform separate simulations of flux emergence and allow astronomers to interpret observations of M dwarf magnetic activity.  Her work will assess whether buoyant magnetic structures emerge self-consistently in these stars, as they are in rapidly rotating Sun-like stars.  Comparing such structures with those studied through traditional flux emergence models will allow a better understanding of the flux pattern expected at the stellar surface. Weber will also seek to increase public science literacy by inspiring science communication through three-dimensional visualizations and by training students in the skills necessary to deliver impactful public presentations."

Specifically, the project seeks to evaluate the contribution of primary production supported by the energy in nitrogen compounds to the overall supply of organic carbon to the food web of the Southern Ocean.  Previous measurements indicate that nitrification could contribute about 9% to primary production supporting the Antarctic food web on an annual basis, but those measurements did not include the additional production associated with nitrite oxidation.  Additionally, the project will aim to determine the significance of the contribution of other sources of nitrogen, (specifically organic nitrogen and urea released by other organisms) to nitrification because these contributions may not be assessed by standard protocols. Such work will aid in better understanding the basis of the energy for the Antarctic marine ecosystems on an annual basis as well as better aid in understanding the energetics of the ecosystem in times and places where primary production based on light energy is limited (i.e. during the polar night or under sea ice cover). <br/><br/>This project will result in training a postdoctoral researcher and provide undergraduate students opportunities to gain hand-on experience with research on microbial geochemistry. The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) activities have focused largely on the interaction between ocean climate and the marine food web affecting top predators. Relatively little effort has been devoted to studying processes related to the microbial geochemistry of nitrogen cycling, yet these are a major themes at other LTER sites. This work will contribute substantially to understanding an important aspect of nitrogen cycling and bacterioplankton production in the study area.

The project will compare these estimates to direct measurements of the incorporation of 14C into organic matter in the dark for an independent estimate of chemoautotrophy.  The team aims to collect samples spanning the water column: from surface water (~10 m), winter water (50-100 m) and circumpolar deep water (>150 m); on a cruise surveying the continental shelf and slope west of the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral summer of 2018. Other samples will be taken to measure the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and urea, for qPCR analysis of the abundance of relevant microorganisms, and for studies of related processes. The project will rely on collaboration with the existing Palmer LTER to ensure that ancillary data (bacterioplankton abundance and production, chlorophyll, physical and chemical variables) will be available. The synergistic activities of this project along with the LTER activities will provide a unique opportunity to assess chemoautotrophy in context of the overall ecosystem's dynamics- including both primary and secondary production processes."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. In alignment with these aims, the University of Washington will design and pilot an innovative leadership development program, NextGen Broadening Participation in ISE Professional Learning Program, to develop the leadership capacity of mid-career professionals, primarily from underrepresented groups in STEM, whose work focuses on broadening participation in informal STEM education (ISE). Unlike most existing ISE leadership models, this pathways project will employ a bottom-up, iterative design approach to engage program participants and garner new insights. Formative data and analysis will be used to better understand the broadening participation context, inform the model, and develop strategies and resources necessary to best support a more diversified next generation of ISE leaders. This pilot study is timely and significant. There is currently a substantial dearth of literature on the intersection between broadening participation and mid-level professional leadership development. Likewise, there are few comparable models in the current AISL portfolio. As such, the findings from this pilot will address critical gaps in the AISL portfolio and in the field, at large. It has the potential to markedly transform the capacity and impact of next generation ISE leaders. <br/><br/>Over an eighteen-month period, this feasibility study will design, implement and test key aspects of the model to determine its potential for short and long term success. Using a competitive application process, twenty ISE mid-career professionals, who work primarily within broadening participation in STEM contexts, will be recruited to participate in the NextGen Broadening Participation in ISE Professional Learning Program. The year-long program includes four core components: (a) 4-day workshop, (b) four online webinars, (c) pilot projects carried out in participants' home institutions, and (d) poster presentations of projects at a national conference. A small cohort of faculty-mentors -- leaders from both research and practice in ISE broadening participation efforts -- will serve as participant mentors and play an integral role in the design and implementation of the program. Evaluative efforts will focus on documenting the efficacy of the design strategies (ex., recruitment, mentorship, social networking), the interests, needs, and professional growth of participants and the implications for broadening participation in STEM. The evaluation will be informed by data collected via interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations, content analyses of discourse, and participant deliverables. Formative and summative external evaluations will be conducted by the Garibay Group."

To realize this potential, scientists and engineers must find the right physical system in which to implement quantum bits, called qubits, with sufficiently low error rates. Small superconducting devices are one of the most promising candidates for building physical devices that function as qubits. This research seeks to address fundamental questions about the nature of small superconducting devices. The researchers make sensitive magnetic measurements to detect the current flowing through a superconducting device to determine whether it has a conventional superconducting state or an unconventional, ""topological"" superconducting state. Topological superconducting state are states that host special modes at their boundaries, called Majoranas modes. Qubits based on these Majorana modes could greatly reduce errors compared to other types of qubits. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The proposed operation of topological qubits is based on a special zero-energy modes known as Majorana modes. The objective of this research is to experimentally demonstrate the existence of Majorana modes using a new generation of fast, highly sensitive Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors. The two most important properties are the current-phase relation, a fundamental relation that will have conclusive signatures of Majoranas if they are present and stable, and the parity lifetime, which determines how long the Majorana states are stable. The experiments address longstanding questions in conventional (non-topological) mesoscopic superconductivity, such as the behavior of tunable few-mode junctions with perfect transmission. They also address newer, more urgent questions in topological devices, such as in which systems Majorana fermions exist and for how long their properties are stable. The realization and control of Majoranas would have great foundational significance as an experimental instance of engineered particles with non-Abelian statistics and could also enable certain quantum information technologies. The activities additionally foster the development of fast, ultrasensitive magnetic measurement techniques that are relatively noninvasive. The researchers engage actively in community and outreach activities designed to provide role models and experiential learning to science students at all levels. Student and postdoctoral researchers involved in the research are well-trained in nanotechnology, cryogenics, quantum science, and precision measurements, and are prepared for a lifetime of contributions both as educators and as scientists."

This project will develop transformative technologies and curriculum materials to turn the campus of a high school or a geographical information system such as Google Maps into an engineering laboratory with virtually unlimited opportunities for learning and exploration. The project will deliver two innovations: 1) The Smart High School is an engineering platform for designing Internet of Things systems for managing the resources, space, and processes of a school based on real-time analysis of data collected by various sensors deployed by students on campus; and 2) the Virtual Solar World is a computational modeling platform for students to design, deploy, and connect virtual solar power solutions for their homes, schools, and regions. Six standards-aligned curriculum units based on these technologies will be developed to guide student learning and support educational research.  Approximately 2,000 students from rural, suburban, and urban high schools in Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Ohio will participate in this research. project products and findings through the Internet, conferences, publications, and partner networks.<br/><br/>The research is designed to identify technology-enhanced instructional strategies that can simultaneously foster the growth of skills and self-efficacy in scientific reasoning, design thinking, and computational thinking, all of which are needed to build the future infrastructure.

The process is central to the global nitrogen cycle, affecting everything from retention of fertilizer on croplands to removal of excess nitrogen from coastal waters before it can cause blooms of harmful algae.  It also produces nitrous oxide, an ozone-destroying, greenhouse gas.  The energy derived from both steps of nitrification is used to convert inorganic carbon into microbial biomass. The biomass produced contributes to the overall food web production of the Southern Ocean and may be a particularly important subsidy during winter when low light levels restrict the other major source of biomass, primary production by single-celled plants.  This project addresses three fundamental questions about the biology and geochemistry of polar oceans, with a focus on the process of nitrification.  The first question the project will address concerns the contribution of chemoautotrophy (based on nitrification) to the overall supply of organic carbon to the food web of the Southern Ocean.  Previous measurements indicate that it contributes about 9% to the Antarctic food web on an annual basis, but those measurements did not include the additional production associated with nitrite oxidation.

This work will contribute substantially to understanding an important aspect of nitrogen cycling and bacterioplankton production in the PAL-LTER study area. The team will be working synergistically and be participating fully in the education and outreach efforts of the Palmer LTER, including making highlights of the findings available for posting to their project web site and participating in any special efforts they have in the area of outreach.<br/><br/>Part 2:  The proposed work will quantify oxidation rates of 15N supplied as ammonium, urea and nitrite, allowing us to estimate the contribution of urea-derived N and complete nitrification (ammonia to nitrate) to chemoautotrophy and bacterioplankton production in Antarctic coastal waters.  The project will compare these estimates to direct measurements of the incorporation of 14C into organic matter the dark for an independent estimate of chemoautotrophy.  The team aims to collect samples spanning the water column: from surface water (~10 m), winter water (50-100 m) and circumpolar deep water (>150 m); on a cruise surveying the continental shelf and slope west of the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral summer of 2018. Other samples will be taken to measure the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and urea, for qPCR analysis of the abundance of relevant microorganisms, and for studies of related processes. The project will rely on collaboration with the existing Palmer LTER to ensure that ancillary data (bacterioplankton abundance and production, chlorophyll, physical and chemical variables) will be available. The synergistic activities of this project along with the LTER activities will provide a unique opportunity to assess chemoautotrophy in context of the overall ecosystem?s dynamics- including both primary and secondary production processes."

Vast filaments of matter coalesce into galaxies under gravity.  However, the exact nature of this coalescence is  poorly understood.  Recent discoveries of galaxies in the process of forming, called proto-galactic disks, may provide key missing information.  This project will undertake a systematic survey of dozens of them using state-of-the-art observations.  Such observations will obtain both images and spectroscopy (precise, quantitative colors) simultaneously.  These data will probe the physical conditions of galaxies-in-formation for the first time.  The investigators will disseminate their results to a broad audience through public lectures and a coordinated social media campaign.<br/><br/>There are two competing models for coalescing gas into galactic disks:  In the hot accretion model, intergalactic gas falls into halos and is shocked to many millions of degrees.  Alternatively, in the cold accretion model, this gas falls into halos at a relatively ""cold"" temperature of ~10,000s of degrees.  This proposal seeks to discriminate between these two models by undertaking a survey of proto-galactic disks.  Martin and collaborators have previously studied such a proto-galactic disk, ~100 kpc in size, and linked to the cosmic web by a gas filament, and found evidence of cold accretion.   The system is illuminated by a nearby quasar, and therefore amenable to 2D spectroscopy in Lyman-alpha and other spectral lines.  These exciting observations are now being pursued by other teams.  Only with recent instrumentation have such studies become feasible.  In this proposal, the investigators seek to expand their sample by conducting a systematic survey of proto-galactic disks using integral field spectroscopy with the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (PCWI) and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI).  These instruments are ideally suited to this type of investigation, and the PI of this proposal is the PI of the KCWI instrument.  A preliminary pilot survey shows a promising number of targets for study in their full sample."

In the past few decades, it has become an exciting and fundamental area of mathematical research, due in part to close connections with many other parts of mathematics as well as physics. Symplectic geometry has had especially striking recent applications to low-dimensional topology, the mathematical study of three- and four-dimensional spaces. The Principal Investigator will pursue one particularly promising technique along these lines, in the setting of the theory of knots, or loops of string that are tied together at their ends. This technique has proven to be of interest to the physics community, providing tantalizing clues of an as-yet-undiscovered framework that combines portions of mathematics (in particular, symplectic geometry) and theoretical physics (in particular, string theory, which provides a model for the fundamental forces that shape the universe). The present project will work to uncover this framework, facilitating the exchange of ideas between mathematics and physics. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the training of future mathematicians, running research programs and mathematical competitions for both undergraduate students and local high school students.<br/><br/>The unifying approach to symplectic geometry in this project is provided by holomorphic curves. Since pioneering work by Gromov in the 1980s, holomorphic curves have become a central tool in symplectic geometry, combining powerful analytical and geometric techniques with a computable combinatorial flavor. The research supported by this award applies holomorphic curves to the setting of knots. Previous work by the Principal Investigator and collaborators led to the development of knot contact homology, a powerful knot invariant in the spirit of Symplectic Field Theory, which has evolved into a subject that has many unexpected and intriguing connections to various areas of mathematics and physics. Recent results have opened the door to a detailed exploration of these connections, which will be carried out in this project. Within symplectic geometry, knot contact homology motivates a close study of a new type of Floer theory (partially wrapped Floer homology); in knot theory, it is conjecturally related to topological concepts like Seifert genus and concordance; in topological string theory, it is conjectured to be determined by a certain Calabi-Yau manifold that has been the object of much study in recent years. Besides tackling these conjectures, the Principal Investigator will pursue a related project, following on a recently discovered connection between constructible sheaves (from algebraic geometry) on one side, and holomorphic curves on the other. This project will develop this connection, in particular working to define an analogue of the Fukaya category for contact manifolds and applying this to facilitate computations in Fukaya categories and mirror symmetry."

This is partly because modern applications are increasingly safety critical, partly because testing is by its very nature only a partial correctness guarantee, and partly because programming language technology has now advanced to the stage where it is feasible to formally verify critical programs. Language-based verification uses a language's type system to guarantee program correctness, so that type-checking a program becomes tantamount to verifying its correctness. Thus, the more program properties a type system can express, the more the compiler can automatically verify. Indexed programming is a key technique for using a language's type system to express more and more sophisticated properties of programs. Indexed programming uses the extra information present in type indices to help close the so-called ""semantic gap"" between what programmers know about their programs and what type systems can express about them. The intellectual merits of this project lie in providing a principled methodology for transferring knowledge about effective programming and proving between languages supporting type-indexing of types and those supporting term-indexing of types, developing a semantic framework that enhances researchers' and practitioners' understanding of the nature of indexed types in general, and opening the way for new forms of indexing that can enforce even greater correctness guarantees. The broader impact of this project is to use indexed types to develop better and more widely applicable formal program verification methods, and, thereby, to help ensure that even large and sophisticated software systems are safe and reliable. Because it will lead to provably correct and secure software, this project has the potential to impact any application area, and thus any sector of the economy, for which such software is paramount.<br/><br/>This project will use the algebraic structure of indexing to guide the way programmers program with indexed types. Specifically, it will advance the state-of-the-art by providing an axiomatic framework for indexed programming that is principled, conceptually simple, comprehensive, uniform, and predictive. It will use the categorical notion of a fibration to ensure that the framework is general enough both to describe traditional type- and term-indexing of types, and to prescribe approaches to indexed programming when indices have more sophisticated and computationally useful algebraic structure. To this end, it will develop analogues of the adjoint structure present in the fibrations underlying traditional type- and term-indexing for more general fibrations interpreting programs, their types, and their properties. Because fibrations can uniformly model very general notions of ""index"" and ""program property"" in very general computational settings, they are indeed a promising foundation for the new framework. The development of the framework will drive both theory and practice forward by transferring knowledge between the traditional type- and term-indexed settings, solving state-of-the-art problems in each of these settings, and providing an understanding of the conceptual essence of indexed programming that allows problem solutions from these traditional settings to be extended to new ones."

Self-assembly is a powerful approach to create large, complex molecules without the challenge of complex step-by-step synthesis. This process is similar to molecular-level Lego, whereby individual pieces can be simply put together to make a larger, more complex structure. In this research project, Prof. Hooley aims to develop self-assembly approaches to creating new chemical structures that act in a manner similar to enzymes and to explore the potential applications of these structures in catalysis. This project provides interdisciplinary research training to graduate students and opportunities to underrepresented undergraduates for intellectual and creative development. Educational innovations are integrated with research to encourage undergraduates and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in science and to improve the chemistry curriculum at UC Riverside with a focus on increasing retention of students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Self-assembled cage complexes can display novel material and sensing properties, but simple molecular polyhedra have limits in their functional applications. Prof. Hooley's research group seeks to remedy this by creating new functional synthetic receptors via metal-ligand based self-assembly. This project focuses on three specific areas:  1) the application of internal functions of ligands to control (via secondary weak interactions) the self-assembly process, including self-sorting and the control of stoichiometry and stereochemistry of cage complexes; 2) post-assembly modifications of internal functional groups to alter reactivity and to allow controlled, reversible structural switching between different polyhedral geometries and trapping of cage complexes; and 3) the application of these complexes as biomimetic catalysts in tandem, orthogonal catalysis. An important objective in this area is to demonstrate that the sequestration of acidic and basic functions in cage interiors allows normally incompatible reactions to be performed in a single pot."

Alongside this research, Douglas will provide astronomy research experiences to middle school students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and to undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science.  <br/><br/>Douglas will study the relationship between a star's rotation period and the proximity of a companion.  Observations of open clusters show that among stars of a given age, the rapid rotators tend to be binaries.  This could be because of tidal effects acting over 0.01 - 10 billion years or interactions between the binary companion and the protoplanetary disk during the first 10 million years.  Both effects would cause binary stars to rotate faster than single stars, thus affecting angular momentum evolution in the binary systems.  Douglas will combine rotation periods and binary orbital parameters to explain why rapidly rotating stars tend to be binaries.  Douglas will use photometry, spectroscopy, and light curves to identify candidate binaries as well as new radial velocity observations to measure orbits.  These data will allow her to test how binary companions affect stellar rotation over time.  For the educational component of her work, Douglas will develop inquiry-based activities to introduce middle school students to binary and exoplanet research.

Leveraging the STEM capacity of USC and its Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, the project will generate greater academic interest and awareness among early-level MSMU undergraduates in geoscience and environmental fields. It will also provide participants with the academic and field experience necessary to succeed in advanced degree programs and careers in these fields.<br/><br/>Underrepresented minority university students enter majors in STEM fields at a similar rate to other students, but completion rates are lower (National Academies, 2011). MSMU?s GEOPATHS program provides female, minority, low-income, predominantly first-generation college students with undergraduate hands-on research experiences, active learning in introductory courses, and membership in a STEM learning community aimed at increasing interest in the sciences and improving student outcomes. The GEOPATHS program will recruit early undergraduates at MSMU for year-round catalytic experiences designed to: 1) introduce participants to oceanography and environmental science fields through project-based learning at USC?s marine research station on Catalina Island, 2) conduct field/laboratory studies mentored by faculty and researchers, 3) build expertise and confidence for subsequent participation in national programs and advanced USC courses not available at MSMU, and 4) inform students about geoscience graduate school and workforce opportunities. At the same time, the program will fortify MSMU?s goals to develop an environmental science track for students, develop cross-campus practices between USC and MSMU geoscience programs, and broaden USC?s ongoing initiatives to attract diverse populations into STEM graduate programs. Through these activities, the project intends to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge concerning strategies for entraining and retaining underrepresented students in geosciences majors and career paths.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>Research indicates a lack of racial and ethnic diversity in graduate STEM programs and among STEM faculty. In particular, the geosciences are cited as having the lowest diversity of all the STEM fields at all levels of higher education (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2015). In 2010, while 20% of all U.S. bachelor?s degrees were awarded to underrepresented minorities, fewer than 7% of geoscience bachelor?s degrees were awarded to the same groups (Stokes et al., 2014). These statistics highlight the need for creative investments in evidence-based and evidence-generating strategies to broaden geoscience access and improve retention among underrepresented groups. Mount Saint Mary?s University?s (MSMU) GEOPATHS-EXTRA program will expand environmental and geoscience opportunities for underrepresented and predominantly first-generation female college students in Los Angeles, California.

The program will enroll 14 MSMU students per annual cohort, directly impacting a total of 42 students?predominately Biological Sciences majors, with priority to first-generation and underrepresented students. Programming at MSMU and USC campuses will be scaffolded to extend MSMU introductory STEM coursework, providing diversified teaching methods and emphasizing 1) early research experiences, 2) active learning, and 3) membership in STEM learning communities.

With over five hundred federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States, there is much to learn and understand. This Culturally Responsive Indigenous Science project seeks to advance this knowledge base through research and by catalyzing new approaches to Indigenous science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (ISTEM) learning. Using an ISTEM focused model, the project will develop, test, and implement a culturally responsive land-based curriculum that integrates Western science, multimodal technologies and digital tools, and Native American tribal knowledge, cultures and languages to investigate and address local environmental science and sustainability concerns. While Indigenous STEM teaching and learning as constructs have existed for many years, the rigorous research design and extensive integration of multimodal technologies as platforms for scientific inquiry, data management, knowledge dissemination and curation are innovative and timely. Few, if any, Design and Development projects in the current DRK-12 portfolio explore similar work. Therefore, the broader impacts of this project are poised to not only contribute to the DRK-12 portfolio but also advance knowledge in Indigenous STEM education and science education, more broadly. <br/><br/>Over a three year period, hundreds of Native American students (grades 4-9) in tribal schools located in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho will engage in the project. Each year, approximately 60-80 students (grades 7-9), with some returning students, will also participate in enrichment activities and in years 1-3, in the residential summer experience at Washington State University. A qualitative, quasi-experimental design-based study will be conducted to address three salient research questions: (a) What are the impacts of culturally responsive and land education-based ISTEM curriculum and technology on Native American student engagement, efficacy and achievement in school? (b) What types of professional development activities foster teacher efficacy and improve teacher learning and teaching of ISTEM in classrooms? and (c) How can ISTEM foster greater family and community engagement in schools and in Tribal Communities?  Data will be collected through interviews, surveys, and or questionnaires from participating students, teachers, and Tribal members. Consistent with Indigenous methodologies, focus group interviews (talking circles) will also be facilitated after ISTEM community expositions and engagement activities to capture community impacts. Formative and summative evaluations will be conducted by the Learning and Performance Research Center (LPRC) at Washington State University, an independent entity of the University with extensive expertise in project evaluation. A broad range of dissemination activities will be employed to achieve maximum impacts, including the use of the Plateau People's Web Portal, a digital tool designed to help Native communities to manage, circulate, and curate their digital materials using their own cultural protocols, language and social systems.

The team will also partner with Florida's Center for Precollegiate Education and Training.  Via that STEM partnership, the team will develop materials to train high-school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The team will use observations to investigate the distribution, frequency, and properties of AGNs in massive clusters of galaxies at a redshift of about one.  The team's goals are (1) to quantify the spatial distribution of AGNs as a function of environment and redshift, to isolate the physical factors that trigger AGNs, (2) to determine the impact of a cluster's halo mass on the AGN associated with its central galaxy, and (3) to constrain the duty cycle and energetic feedback from the AGNs in the brightest cluster galaxies."

Silicon also has the potential to revolutionize the energy storage industry because it is one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, well-designed silicon anodes often require elaborated synthesis methods requiring the use of toxic chemicals, making it difficult to embrace these methods for widespread applications of silicon anodes. This award will address this deficiency by investigating a novel, simple and scalable nanomanufacturing method to produce silicon anodes with well-designed hierarchical structures at low cost and with no involvement of toxic chemicals. The research work leads to a nanomanufacturing method that is scalable at industry level and that can fabricate silicon/carbon nanocomposites with well-designed internal structures and unprecedented performance for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. The availability of new anode materials paves the way to enable broad market penetration of electric vehicles, extend cell phone working hours to multiple days before recharging, broaden the application areas of batteries including military usage, and make the technology greener and more energy efficient. The project offers undergraduate students opportunities to participate in research through a semester long Inter-professional Project. Presentations on ""Roles of Chemistry in Lithium-ion Batteries"" with hands-on demonstrations are planned in the science classes of high schools with high percentage of under-represented minority students. These activities are designed to inspire high school stucents to pursue careers in science, engineering and technology.<br/><br/>This project is the first to investigate a simple and scalable nanomanufacturing method that can fabricate Si anodes with a well-designed hierarchical structure that combines features of nanoscale Si building-blocks, conductive coatings and engineered void space plus in-situ formation of graphene. This well-engineered hierarchical structure offers Si anodes with large specific-capacity, high specific power and long cycle life as well as high areal capacity. This nanomanufacturing method starts with commercially available micron-sized Si and graphite particles, which are subjected to high-energy ball milling during which graphene is produced in situ. The entire nanomanufacturing process and powder handling is carried out in ambient environment except during the high-energy ball milling and carbon coating processes, making this nanomanufacturing method easily scalable at industrial levels. The project leads to a nanomanufacturing method to fabricate hierarchical silicon/carbon nanocomposite anodes with unprecedented properties and performance at low cost and without the use of toxic chemicals."

Existing security policies and mechanisms---such as the same origin policy (SOP), the content security policy (CSP), and permission systems for extensions---are too coarse grained and not sufficient to protect users' data. Prior work has proposed information flow control (IFC) as a solution. However, existing IFC solutions are not yet practical: they suffer from poor usability and struggle to interoperate with other enforcement mechanisms that protect parts of web applications or browser state. The goal of this project is to construct a practical, usable, and secure browser infrastructure.<br/><br/>The project will develop a modular model for a provably secure browser infrastructure using compositional principles.  This model will be instantiated with concrete enforcement mechanisms to develop a browser that meets the functionality standards of current browser platforms. An important part of the project is to understand users' perceptions and expectations with respect to security goals; to extract practical IFC policies based on user data; and to build mechanisms that help users safely navigate the web.  Finally, the project will develop testing and validation benchmarks and use these benchmarks to compare the effectiveness and the cost of different enforcement mechanisms. The results of this project will lay the foundation for building practical web browsers that have information flow security built in.

Declarative modeling is not yet a common practice, because writing declarative models correctly is still challenging and a barrier to challenging problem.  To remove this impediment to the practical application of declarative (relational) modeling,  the project brings software testing concepts, methods, and tool chains to formal specifications based on the Alloy relational modeling system and its underlying satisfiability solving back-ends. Such approaches include unit testing, test generation, the definition and use of coverage metrics to underpin notions of test suite adequacy, and selective regression testing in the face of small changes to specifications.<br/><br/>Three primary research thrusts are proposed: to build the foundations of a test-driven approach for declarative models; to define testing techniques to validate the correctness of models that users write; and to introduce sketching techniques that allow users to write incomplete models, which are completed using automated synthesis. The implementation of robust tools and a rigorous experimental evaluation based on controlled experiments and case-studies cross-cuts the research thrusts. The ability to develop correct designs, as envisioned by this project, can lead to a major increase in software reliability and dependability, which can bring substantial economic benefits and significantly improve quality of life."

While additive manufacturing strategies are very useful at the macroscopic scale, these approaches have not achieved manufacturing-level reproducibility when patterning soft materials at the nanoscale. This award will enable nanoscale manufacturing of soft materials by providing the tools and understanding needed to realize patterning with industry-required reliably and nanoscale resolution. This interdisciplinary work spans fluid mechanics, control theory, and nanoscience and contributes to the undergraduate and graduate level education of engineering students. Furthermore, this work provides opportunities for students from broad backgrounds to design and interact with materials at previously inaccessible scales. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research work is to develop the fundamental and technological foundation to transition tip-based nanopatterning of soft materials into a manufacturing tool. This approach is based on the transfer of material from an ink-coated scanning probe to a surface.

This research work addresses a number of processing issues that have not previously received attention. It investigates and develops novel approaches, e.g., a method for precisely monitoring the quantity of ink that is on a probe, an ink formulation that allows one to pattern and image with the same probe, and a procedure for monitoring and controlling the concentration of reagents in the ink during patterning. Equally important, these studies are designed to provide deeper insight into the patterning process and answer open questions about nanoscale capillarity and statistical mechanics in systems that violate the continuum hypothesis. Additionally, these new approaches are combined with advanced models of patterning to form an automated closed-loop feedback system that iteratively improves the quality of patterning in situ."

The objective of the project is to train students to think and act like scientists - to propose hypotheses, to design experiments, to analyze data, to draw conclusions, and to communicate with other scientists.  Students on six campuses (Rochester Institute of Technology, Hope College, California Polytechnic Institute, Ursinus College, St. Mary's University, and SUNY Oswego) will engage in computational and wet lab approaches to predict protein function.  In a previous project, the team of principal investigators created a series of modules to guide student inquiry and video instructions for the computational techniques, which were deployed in biochemistry teaching laboratories across the six campuses.  In the present project, the faculty team will classify and characterize the research behaviors that students display during the course and will develop and validate methods for understanding students' development as scientists.  Because the students are participating in authentic research, results from their experiments will also be collated into a database that can be used by future students to pursue biologically relevant protein functions, such as the potential discovery of drug targets for diseases.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of the project is to introduce cutting-edge biochemistry research into the classroom to investigate whether getting students to participate in hypothesis-driven experimental science is a useful tool in educating students to become scientists.   In this second phase of a course-based undergraduate research experience, students' learning and growth as scientists will be assessed by local biochemistry faculty and evaluated by educational researchers at Purdue University, to ascertain students' understanding of research methods, visualization, biological context, and mechanisms of protein function. The faculty team will develop validated assessment tools to measure these objectives, and will balance the homogeneity of curricular materials needed to ensure sound education with the flexibility needed for adaptation in different institutional settings. The course instructors and project evaluators will collaborate using education research techniques to monitor both students' development of research behaviors and changes in instructors' teaching approaches.  The refined and tested curriculum will then be ready for wider dissemination into the biochemistry teaching community.

For electrochemical energy storage devices, daily operation involves the electrochemical insertion and extraction of ions, which is often accompanied by larger structural transformations that may cause the material to collapse. Hence, the search for new electrode materials is necessary in order for future energy storage demands to be realized. Clathrates are a class of materials with cage-like structures that can naturally hold guest ions, a feature that may be exploited in energy storage applications. However, different features in the clathrate bonding arrangement may affect its mechanical integrity. Key objectives of this project are to understand the electrochemical characteristics of these materials, how the structure of the clathrate changes upon electrochemical insertion of guest ions, and the development of new synthetic routes to obtain clathrates. Results from this project enable new knowledge on the intricate relationships among the clathrates? structures and their physical properties, electrochemical characteristics, and structural stability.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The objectives of this project are: (1) to investigate the electrochemical and structural properties of germanium and tin clathrates using first principles calculations and detailed structural characterization to understand the electrochemically obtained structures; and (2) to synthesize new clathrates containing lithium ions from novel precursors. The project uses a concerted approach combining the synthetic, structural and electrochemical characterization, and theoretical expertise of the investigators. The research enables a better understanding of the relationship between the clathrate structure and its physical properties, electrochemical characteristics, and phase stability. These achievements could lead to higher energy density lithium and sodium batteries. The studies also help to build up the predictive power of solid-state chemistry, establishing new ideas of why and how atoms assemble and form new compounds and structures with the desired electrochemical properties. Investigation of these materials involves a collaboration between two universities (Arizona State University and University of Delaware) and three different departments (materials science, chemistry, and physics), which exposes students to multidisciplinary research.

For example, we want to know how a decision support system arrived at its suggestion for a particular health-care plan or why a self-driving car could not avoid an accident. Despite this need for understanding computing systems, few systems today explain their behavior to their users. This research explores the nature of explanations and how they can be employed in the creation of computing systems that can explain their behavior to programmers and users.<br/><br/> Based on an analysis of the nature of explanations and their properties, this research explores operations for the composition and transformation of explanations and the alignment with computations. Part of the research is the development of criteria to judge the quality of explanations and develop guidelines for the design and implementation of explanation languages. Altogether, this research produces a theory of explanation languages. The development of example explanation languages as suggested by the developed theory and their evaluation according to the explanation quality criteria supports the assessment of the research progress. The broader impact of this project includes support for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students who will carry the ideas developed in this project out into the world. Moreover, a theory of explanations and a framework for systematically adding explanations to computing systems empowers software developers to make their products more widely understandable and trustworthy, which ultimately enhances the acceptance of new technologies in society. This research leads to methods and tools that affect the design of future software.

An important part of this story is the chemical evolution of galaxies. The formation of the elements in stars and their subsequent dispersal are powerful tracers of structure formation and evolution.  This project will simulate on Blue Waters processes deep inside stars that play an important role in the heavy elements they generate. These processes are driven by mixing of gases at the boundaries of convection zones, which can bring new fuels into a convection zone, carrying them down into much hotter regions where they burn very rapidly and activate nuclear reaction networks in a special convective-reactive regime. In this regime, reacting nuclei are transported by the turbulent convection flow on about the same timescale as the reactions take place, so that significant departures from spherical symmetry, even in a statistical sense, can result.  This project will use the petascale capabilities of Blue Waters to simulate these brief events in 3D.<br/><br/>This project we will build on earlier work on Blue Waters to study a process where the O-shell convection zone in a massive star can work its way to the base of the C-shell convection zone above, leading to ingestion of carbon fuel and an ultimate merger of the two burning shells. The project will compute the resulting nucleosynthesis by following the concentrations of a large number of nuclear isotopes and computing their interactions on a 4-D grid of reduced resolution in space and time. A fine grid is required to accurately advance the turbulent convection flow and to compute the amount of fuel entrained in it at the convection zone boundary.  The study will follow the most important species on this fine grid, but will represent on the coarser grid the large number of nuclear reactions from which energy release is minor and has minimal back reaction on the flow.   This project will generate a large database of results from the 3-D simulations on Blue Waters of convective boundary mixing in stellar interiors. The project intends to organize this database so that the simulation codes can mine it automatically, comparing it to a variety of potentially useful 1-D models of the mixing process.  In terms of broader impacts, the project will make this database and tools available to the community on-line in a useful format, so that it will enable research by many others.  In addition, the project will work with the NuGrid collaboration to see that the results are incorporated into data sets that are available to the community for chemical evolution simulations of galaxies and structures in the early universe."

This breakthrough marks the beginning of the era of GW astronomy. They also provide the strongest evidence yet that Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) is the correct theory of gravity and that binary and spinning black holes exist with the properties prescribed by GR. The research funded within this project spans several problems involving GR, the generation of GWs, relativistic hydrodynamics (fluid flow in strong gravitational fields and moving at the speed of light)) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (fluid flow in magnetic fields). A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs) provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars and  binary black hole--neutron stars), the generation of GWs from compact binaries and other promising astrophysical sources and the electromagnetic signals that may accompany them (e.g., gamma-ray bursts), gravitational collapse, circumbinary disks around merging supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars, and the profile and observable consequences of dark matter (the major form of matter in the universe and unlike normal atoms and their constituents) around supermassive black holes in galaxy cores, including the Milky Way. The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those planned for GW interferometers, such as the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO network, GEO, KAGRA, the PTAs and LISA, and transient-event electromagnetic detectors, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).<br/><br/>Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale simulations on supercomputers, in addition to analytical modeling. The key tool will be our robust and well-tested Illinois general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. The simulations solve Einstein's field equations of GR for gravity coupled to the equations of relativistic MHD for the fluid and Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields. These equations constitute highly nonlinear, coupled partial differential equations in 3+1 dimensions that we solve by finite-differencing. The Illinois GRMHD code employs the BSSN technique with moving puncture gauge conditions to solve the field equations and a high-resolution, shock capturing scheme for the MHD. The problems to be tackled comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes, as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both electromagnetic and neutrino radiation (""multimessenger astronomy"")."

Both processes offer alternatives to conventional processes that rely on hydrocarbon resources for the needed hydrogen.  Thus the project will support NSF's initiatives in the areas of sustainable energy generation and Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water (INFEWS), the latter via the importance of NH3 as the world's primary raw material for nitrogen-based fertilizer production. In particular, the research is aimed at discovering efficient, nonprecious metal nanocatalysts for the targeted electrochemical processes that can operate at ambient temperature conditions rather than the high-temperature conditions required for hydrocarbon-based technologies.  The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has the potential to generate NH3 at lower net energy consumption than the traditional Haber-Bosch thermal catalytic process which accounts for between 1 and 2% of world energy consumption.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the project seeks advances in catalytic electrolyzers for both NRR and OER.  The work will focus exclusively on nonprecious metal bimetallic catalysts operating in alkaline electrochemical environments, thus enabling low-cost, technology-enabling alternatives to the precious metals. The project is built on preliminary data suggesting that specific control of the spatial composition and morphology of heterostructured nanoparticles will enable enhanced catalytic activity and also establish fundamental understanding of composition-activity relationships for key bimetallic systems in nanoparticle form. The specific research objectives are: (1) to synthesize and characterize novel heteronanostructures of nonprecious Fe-Ni bimetals composed of a hetero-core with/without an alloyed shell, (2) to evaluate the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts for electrochemical NRR and OER in alkaline systems, and (3) to develop in operando methods to correlate the structure and composition with electrocatalytic activity using x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Beyond the targeted reactions, introduction of low-cost, nonprecious nanoparticle catalysts are of increasing interest for a broad range of catalytic applications, including electrocatalysis.  Validation of the proposed novel nonprecious nanostructures, where specific spatial composition is correlated with the performance metrics and in operando characterization, will enable an approach to catalyst design that could be widely applied to enable cost- and performance-competitive catalysts for commercialization. Furthermore, controlling catalyst selectivity through structural design would enable key advances for important reactions related to water treatment, energy conversion, and agriculture.  To support this objective, an integrated approach of research and education will be established to increase student participation in STEM research, to pursue STEM majors, and to train next-generation leaders in the interdisciplinary field of nanocatalysts. The investigators will actively recruit students, especially unrepresented student groups, to their research programs. The research findings will be integrated into teaching for undergraduate and graduate curriculum development in both Chemistry and Chemical Engineering departments. In addition, the investigators will strengthen the current summer programs by involving K-12 teachers through American Chemical Society Science Coaches and the University of Arkansas Engineering Academy Programs, as well as organizing an annual workshop for students and K-12 teachers on Nanocatalyst Discovery."

While much emphasis has been placed on providing maker opportunities for students, teachers also need these experiences to become qualified mentors and proficient facilitators of modern STEM learning. MakerSTEM will help pre-service teachers in Hawaii to develop proficiency in scientific investigation and design practices, and to become innovators of student-driven active learning. The cumulative impact over the course of a single teacher's career could reach 4,500 students. If successful, this maker-based approach can be transferred to other teacher training programs, potentially transforming K-12 science education by empowering teachers with deep pedagogical content knowledge and skills that align with 21st Century STEM careers.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project includes investigation of 1) the efficacy of applying makerspace design principles to a science teacher credential program and 2) the impact of MakerSTEM lab environment on pre-service teacher STEM learning and practice through a longitudinal case-study approach. Knowledge gained from this research will result in a new heuristic model for how making can be effectively incorporated into STEM teacher education. This line of investigation will begin to further inform evidence-based teaching practices to improve learning outcomes and contribute to a generalized grounded theory of STEM learning in college maker labs. These insights may catalyze novel possibilities for the way science and science education is offered on college campuses. The potential for communities of learners to emerge within university maker labs may remodel the overall STEM college learning experience, enabling students to address student-defined problems and build collaborative partnerships in a way that parallels professional practices."

In 2015, while 57% of professional occupations in the U.S. were held by women, only 25% of computing occupations were held by women.  Furthermore, the share of computer science degrees going to women is smaller than any STEM field, even though technology careers are the most promising in terms of salaries and future growth.  Research suggests that issues contributing to this lack of computer science participation begin early and involve complex social and environmental factors, including girls' perception that they do not belong in computer science classes or careers.  Computer science instruction often alienates girls with irrelevant curriculum; non-collaborative pedagogies; a lack of opportunities to take risks or make mistakes; and a heavy reliance on lecture instead of hands-on, project-based learning.  Computer science experiences that employ research-based gender equitable best practices, particularly role modeling, can help diminish the gender gap in participation. In response to this challenge, Twin Cities PBS (TPT), the National Girls Collaborative (NGC) and Code.org will lead Code: SciGirls! Media for Engaging Girls in Computing Pathways, a three-year project designed to engage 8-13 year-old girls in coding through transmedia programming which inspires and prepares them for future computer science studies and career paths.  The project includes five new PBS SciGirls episodes featuring girls and female coding professionals using coding to solve real problems; a new interactive PBSKids.org game that allows children to develop coding skills; nationwide outreach programming, including professional development for informal educators and female coding professionals to facilitate activities for girls and families in diverse STEM learning environments; a research study that will advance understanding of how the transmedia components build girls' motivation to pursue additional coding experiences; and a third-party summative evaluation. <br/><br/>Code: SciGirls! will foster greater awareness of and engagement in computer science studies and career paths for girls.  The PBS SciGirls episodes will feature girls and female computer science professionals using coding to solve real-world challenges. The project's transmedia component will leverage the television content into the online space in which much of 21st century learning takes place.  The new interactive PBSKids.org game will use a narrative framework to help children develop coding skills.  Drawing on narrative transportation theory and character identification theory, TPT will commission two exploratory knowledge-building studies to investigate: To what extent and how do the narrative formats of the Code: SciGirls! online media affect girls' interest, beliefs, and behavioral intent towards coding and code-related careers?  The studies aim to advance understanding of how media builds girls' motivation to pursue computer science experiences, a skill set critical to building tomorrow's workforce. The project team will also raise educators' awareness about the importance of gender equitable computer science instruction, and empower them with best practices to welcome, prepare and retain girls in coding.  The Code: SciGirls! Activity Guide will provide educators with a relevant resource for engaging aspiring computer scientists. The new media and guide will also reside on PBSLearningMedia.org, reaching 1.2 million teachers, and will be shared with thousands of educators across the SciGirls CONNECT and National Girls Collaborative networks. The new episodes are anticipated to reach 92% of U.S. TV households via PBS, and the game at PBSKids.org will introduce millions of children to coding. The summative evaluation will examine the reach and impact of the episodes, game and new activities. PIs will share research findings and project resources at national conferences and will submit to relevant publications.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

As students work in makerspaces they traverse and integrate a wide variety of skills that create a dynamic relationship between the learning processes, creative exploration, and expertise acquisition. This work provides an initial examination of this interplay between learning and expertise. It begins to answer the question of what and how students learn in university makerspaces. At present, it is unclear what university students actually learn in university makerspaces and how this compares with other hands-on learning opportunities such as competition team projects, undergraduate research, or similar experiences. Educators hope makerspaces are effective learning environments that can 1) enhance lifelong and self-directed learning skills, 2) expand engineering curricula, and 3) motivate while simultaneously educating the next generation of STEM students. However, there are few studies on the development of expertise and learning or their impact on creativity in makerspaces because these spaces are complex, dynamic, non-standard environments that provoke unprecedented challenges when it comes to their study. In addition, most work on expertise and creativity compares novices and experts but fails to create detailed accounts of how one moves from novice to expert nor how this transition influences the ability to be creative within the domain. Most studies of expertise are comparison studies or simply snapshot of groups at certain points in time. These studies overlook the development of expertise. In makerspaces, students are often motivated by an idea to make a creative project, and in turn they thereby develop expertise and undergo learning. This learning that takes place in makerspaces is natural, organic, and uncontrolled. This study of makerspaces will examine these phenomena as they naturally occur, rather than altering the environment to conform to a typical controlled experiment. This approach enables the study of the evolution of making as engineering makers mature and evolve on two different campuses.<br/><br/>This study will focus on two very different makerspaces at two different universities. Both spaces feature many of the commonly found making equipment (e.g., 3D printers, electronics equipment, wood and metal working equipment, etc.), but each has its own unique culture and placement into the programs at their respective universities.  Further, the differences between the universities create a unique opportunity for comparison.  To study the makerspaces at these two universities, the following methodological procedures will be used: 1) ethnographic observation in making activities, and 2) observations and interviews with student groups and individual students who are making in the engineering makerspaces. This work is also envisioned as a springboard for future studies in understanding makerspaces including makerspace culture, barriers and pathways to entry, tensions produced in the space, student design processes, innovative approaches, and collaborative efforts."

The physics associated with signal propagation and sensing in these problems creates substantial computational challenges for transforming raw data into useful information. The research team in this project aims to develop computational methods that greatly reduce the cost of real time imaging by providing improvements in statistical inverse theory, numerical inversion methods, simulation models, and hybrid imaging models.  The main thrusts of the project will be tested on imaging applications in medical tomography, environmental remediation, and airport security imaging. The techniques form the basis for addressing analogous problems associated with inversion of optical signals across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. As part of the project, a modular course will be developed to teach these new methods at the graduate level. The course materials will be made available over the internet.<br/><br/>The large-scale imaging, or inverse, problems addressed by this collaborative team require the minimization of a parameter-dependent function that expresses the misfit of predicted measurements for a candidate image and actual measurement data. The potentially large number of parameters must be minimized over an ever-increasing huge number of measurements, while concurrently some unknown set of the data may be redundant.  Detailed images, however, are not always needed for addressing relevant, practical questions and decision making. A combination of computational techniques will be developed to make large-scale parameter-dependent minimization computationally feasible.  Furthermore, novel efficient approaches for inferring critical image features will be developed, obviating need for complete reconstruction of an image. The research builds on recent methods that exploit randomization to compute accurate estimates of solutions at greatly reduced computational cost, and on the efficient construction of smaller, approximate, reduced order numerical models that are accurate for relevant sets of parameters, and thus reduce the cost of full simulation of the sensing physics. Probabilistic approaches for inference of critical image features that guide image interpretation and decision making will be developed. The mathematics associated with this approach requires these methods to capitalize on other new tools also under development in this project."

In this second phase of a course-based undergraduate research experience, students' learning and growth as scientists will be assessed by local biochemistry faculty and evaluated by educational researchers at Purdue University, to ascertain students' understanding of research methods, visualization, biological context, and mechanisms of protein function. The faculty team will develop validated assessment tools to measure these objectives, and will balance the homogeneity of curricular materials needed to ensure sound education with the flexibility needed for adaptation in different institutional settings. The course instructors and project evaluators will collaborate using education research techniques to monitor both students' development of research behaviors and changes in instructors' teaching approaches.  The refined and tested curriculum will then be ready for wider dissemination into the biochemistry teaching community.  The need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education and for the inclusion of a more diverse population is widely recognized.  The project team includes faculty from a Hispanic-serving institution and from an institution with a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students; inclusion of these faculty ensures that the needs and concerns of these communities will be included in the project."

Calls from both disabilities studies and national organizations such as the American Institute for Research consistently ask educators to broaden participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields to include individuals with disabilities. Therefore, this work targets an urgent need in engineering education research. The study lays a foundation for broadening participation in engineering by enabling us to better understand the supports and barriers students with disabilities experience. Educators will be able to use the findings to develop inclusive educational experiences that promote identity formation, diversity, and universal design. At the same time, because the students will are followed into the workplace, the findings can benefit engineering employers as they hire engineers with disabilities, again focusing on systems and structures that support inclusion and accessibility. Moreover, the project will build bridges between the engineering education and disabilities studies community by establishing partnerships and bolstering ongoing conversations within engineering that help to move disability from the margins to the center.<br/><br/>The project addresses the call for studies on the ""development of identity as an engineer and its intersection with other identities"" by conducting a longitudinal study of students with disabilities in civil engineering. The project will use constructivist grounded theory to study two cohorts over three years. The first cohort follows 20 students from the fall of their first year through the spring of their junior year, with interviews twice a year (early fall and late spring). The second cohort, run concurrently, follows 20 students from spring of their junior year through their first year in the workplace, again with interviews twice a year. This approach spans the full undergraduate experience as well as the transition to work, and provides a rich data set from which to develop a theory of identity formation for this population. <br/><br/>Consistent with grounded theory, the project does not impose an existing theory on the data; however, the understanding of identity broadly draws on social identity theory (SIT), which treats identities in terms of group membership developed through comparisons of values and behaviors members make with one another and with individuals belonging to other groups. This approach is consistent with existing studies of individuals with disabilities in college as well as with studies of professional identities, and allows the project team to situate the work within the broader landscape of identity research in engineering. The project addresses a significant gap in research on the professional formation of engineers by extending an emergent theoretical model of identity development in civil engineering to students with disabilities as they advance through their degree program and into the workforce. It provides significant contributions to research on identity development in engineering broadly, research on diversity and inclusion in engineering, and research on disability studies in higher education - issues that, to date, have seen little integration. The longitudinal approach advances our understanding of undergraduate development by capturing both how and why individuals with disabilities merge and negotiate personal and professional identities through these changes over time. The model developed in this study can then be used by researchers in other engineering fields and, potentially, beyond engineering to facilitate a more robust and nuanced understanding of how students with disabilities develop identities in college."

The work focuses on the investigation and elucidation of the factors responsible for molecular self-assembly, and how these factors affect the ability of the self-assembled molecular structures to interact and recognize other molecules of biological importance. A variety of experimental and computational methods are used to developed Quantitative Structure Enantioselective Retention Relationships (QSERR). QSERR is then used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different chiral selectors for capillary electrophoretic separations. Two of the three institutions are primarily undergraduate institutions that currently do not have a master's program in chemistry. Thus, the research will be conducted at these two schools exclusively by undergraduate students. One of these is also a Hispanic Serving Institution.

The research serves as a tool for the PIs to recruit, train, and mentor students from underrepresented and economically challenged backgrounds and to encourage these students to pursue post baccalaureate degrees in science.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is part of an ongoing, long-term multi-faceted study focusing on investigating and elucidating the factors responsible for (a) self-assembly, (b) function, (c) higher ordered structure and (d) molecular recognition of amino acid based macromolecular assemblies (AABMAs). In particular, the research will focus on examining the effects that pH, ionic strength, surfactant concentration, and type of counter-ion have on the factors mentioned above. These AABMAs are being utilized in this study as chiral pseudostationary phases in capillary electrophoresis. Thus, the major focus of these studies is to gain insights into the factors responsible for chiral recognition with this class of chiral selector. A deeper understanding of these factors will lead to enhanced chiral separations and improved pseudostationary phases. Understanding such interactions is not only important in the development of chiral recognition media but also in the optimization of the separation conditions. In addition, since enantiorecognition of the systems under study are amino acids, the knowledge gained from these studies will be potentially transferable to other amino acid based systems such as proteins."

Consider a collection of tangled wires and think about organizing them into well-ordered crystals. Such a seemingly difficult task, however, occurs naturally and readily in the real world even for the simplest polymers such as polyethylenes. In fact, most of the materials today are made from such semicrystalline polymers, which constitute a multi-billion-dollar industry. An understanding of the crystallization process of polymers is one of the longstanding research challenges in the materials world, primarily due to the haphazard and random configurations of the polymer molecules before they organize into crystals. As a result, the phenomenon of polymer crystallization is challenging with few unifying conceptual themes. This research program is geared towards development of fundamental concepts to understand how polymers crystallize and melt, using theory and modelling. A fundamental understanding of the behaviours of this important class of materials will help to design and process novel polymeric materials with enhanced benefits to our society. This project includes training graduate students in this challenging research area of tremendous societal value.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on how polymers crystallize. Crystallization of polymers from solutions and melts is one of the longstanding research areas in polymer science with tremendous industrial value, full of intrigue without unifying conceptual themes. A fundamental understanding of how polymer chains organize into hierarchical crystalline structures remains elusive. The most significant endowment of flexible polymer molecules is their conformational entropy. This attribute sets the crystallization and melting behaviours of polymers to be distinct from other ordering phenomena of small molecular systems. This research project is aimed to develop fundamental concepts behind polymer crystallization and melting, by accounting for conformation entropy of polymer chains and topological defects under non-equilibrium conditions. The principal investigator will employ statistical mechanics, field theory, and various simulation techniques in the development of new theories of polymer crystallization and melting. More specifically, the research project will address (a) single crystal morphology - topological defects driving sectorization in lamellae and relative stabilities of flat lamellae, hollow pyramids, scrolls, and twisted lamellae, (b) kinetics of melting and recrystallization of polymer crystals, and (c) macromolecular origin of melt-memory in polymer crystallization.<br/><br/>The results from the research program may have impact in the multi-billion-dollar industry of polyolefins and also in numerous applied areas such as polymer processing, and fabrication of polymeric nanomaterials. Training graduate students in this challenging research area is a strong educational component of the research program."

Factors such as under-preparation in math, being first generation college students, social challenges, and an unfamiliar environment away from home have a negative effect on student motivation, performance, and retention. The SEE project will address these issues and enhance the students' learning and academic success by implementing a flipped learning environment, integrating technology with instruction, and implementing structured mentoring in the entry level math and engineering courses. This serves the national interest by educating students for the technical and scientific workforce.  <br/><br/>The main objective of SEE is to enhance students' self-efficacy, engagement, and motivation by integrating active teaching strategies and techniques. The flipped classroom will allow professors to use face-to-face class time more effectively and engage students in hands-on active learning opportunities. Innovative teaching methods that utilize technology and real-world problem solving will be implemented. The classroom interactions will be supported by math and engineering software. A consultant, whose expertise is in instructional design and authentic assessments, will support the project team. Formative and summative assessments of the pedagogical approach will be carried out through validated instruments of motivation and self-regulated learning.

Multi-messenger astronomy promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe by providing dramatically contrasting views of the same objects. To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

Efficient design and use of future system architectures using emerging technologies will be vital to the future of computing. The acquired equipment and the chip prototyping will be used to train graduate students and undergraduate students including those from under-represented groups advised by the PIs (women and minority students) to gain expertise in the area of computer architecture, Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), and device fabrication.

Estimation procedures that maintain both statistical and computational efficacy are of great practical value, which translate into desiderata such as less time patients need to spend in a medical scanner, faster response to cyber attacks, and capabilities to handle very large datasets. While a lot of signal estimation tasks are naturally formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, existing results for nonconvex methods have several fundamental limitations, and the current state of the art is still limited in terms of when, why and which nonconvex approaches are effective for a given problem. The goal of this research program is to significantly deepen and broaden the understanding and applications of nonconvex optimization for high-dimensional signal estimation.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will study high-dimensional signal estimation via direct optimization of nonconvex, and potentially nonsmooth, loss functions, without resorting to convex relaxation. This research will explore geometric structures shared by nonconvex functions commonly encountered in signal estimation, and study the fundamental roles these structures play in determining the algorithmic convergence. These results will then be exploited as guidelines to develop fast and provably correct algorithms for estimating high-dimensional signals with physically induced structures and under streaming data observations. Specifically, the research program consists of three major thrusts: (1) understanding the geometric structures of important classes of nonconvex loss surfaces, and characterizing their impact on the convergence of optimization algorithms; (2) developing fast algorithms and the associated theory for the recovery of structured low-rank matrices; (3) designing new online algorithms that are time and space efficient under a streaming setting, with the capability of detecting and tracking the time-varying signals of interest."

Many people, however, have a limited understanding of the scope of these changes because they are geographically distant and difficult to visualize. Although both digital learning tools and online scientific data repositories have greatly expanded over the last decade, there is currently no interface that brings the two together in a way that allows the public to explore these rapidly changing glacial environments. Therefore, to both improve public understanding and provide greater access to already existing resources, the project team will develop the Virtual Ice Explorer to encourage informal learning about glacial environments. This web application will feature an immersive virtual environment and display a suite of environmental data for an array of Earth's glacial systems. An interactive globe will allow users to select from a collection of sites ranging from polar regions to tropical latitudes. Each featured site will offer users an opportunity to interact with (1) a 3D rendering of the landscape; (2) a local map of the site; (3) historical and contemporary photographs of the site; (4) background information text describing the location, past research, and climate impacts; and (5) available environmental data. One of the most original features of the application will be its realistic, immersive 3D rendering of glacial landscapes by combining very high-resolution digital elevation models and satellite imagery with the application's built-in capabilities for immersive virtual environments. Although immersive environments often require expensive equipment, we are maximizing accessibility by developing the Virtual Ice Explorer to run in a web browser and function across various devices. Thus, the application will be available to anyone with internet access, and they can explore at their own pace. <br/><br/>As part of the successful development of Virtual Ice Explorer, the project team will create a platform for digital elevation models to be visualized and explored in 3D by users within the web application; curate digital elevation models, maps, images, text, and environmental data for inclusion in the web application for up to 11 geographically diverse glaciers/glacial landscapes; iteratively user-test the web application with project partners; and design the architecture of the system to readily scale to a larger collection of glaciers/glacial landscapes. To extend dissemination of the final products, the team has partnered with the U.S. Geologic Survey to showcase four benchmark glaciers in their long-term Glaciers and Climate project. In addition to improving understanding of glacier systems in informal learning environments, the project team will explore applications for spatial learning, employment of 3D environments for educational interventions, and use of Virtual Ice Explorer in formal learning environments.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project also has support from the Office of Polar Programs."

Multi-messenger astronomy promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe by providing dramatically contrasting views of the same objects. To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This project will focus on learning about model based reasoning in science, and will develop, implement, study, and refine a 6-week climate science module for high school students.  The module will feature use of a web-based climate modeling application, and the project team will collect and analyze evidence of model-based reasoning about climate phenomena among students.  Scientists routinely use data-intensive, computer-based models to study complex natural phenomena, and modeling has become a core objective of current science curriculum standards. The project will provide new insights about student use of scientific models to understand natural phenomena, and advance knowledge about curriculum, instruction, and assessment practices that promote model-based reasoning among students.<br/><br/>This 4-year Design and Development project will examine use of a web-based climate modeling tool designed to provide non-scientists experiences with climate modeling in high school geoscience classrooms. A theoretically-grounded and empirically tested approach to design-based research, instructional design, and assessment development will be used in an iterative cycle of instructional innovation and education research to find answers to two research questions: 1) How do secondary students develop epistemic and conceptual knowledge about climate? And 2) How do secondary science teachers support student use of climate modeling application to develop epistemic and conceptual knowledge about climate?  Data associated with conceptual and epistemic knowledge, curriculum-embedded modeling tasks, interviews, and videorecorded observations of instruction will be used to study impacts of the new curriculum module on 55 high school science teachers and 3,000 students.  Project participants include students from low socioeconomic populations and other groups underrepresented in STEM fields.

This project is devoted to the optical scattering and imaging of nano-structures. The outcome of the theoretical work will provide advances in the understanding of new types of light-matter interactions in subwavelength nano-structures. In addition, the computational frameworks will provide inexpensive, fast, and accurate modeling of optical wave propagation in such tiny structures and enhance near-field optical imaging techniques.  Furthermore, the fast implementations of forward modeling and inverse imaging tools will also provide realistic guidance for the design of nano devices with the desired properties in their interactions with the optical light.<br/><br/>The project focuses on examining fundamental mathematical issues and developing computational methods for new and important classes of problems arising from the optical wave scattering and imaging of nano-structures. This consists of mathematical studies of extraordinary field enhancement in metallic nano-structures and their super-resolution imaging via inverse scattering. The technical focus of the model problems is on Maxwell's equations in complicated and multi-scale media. New analytical tools based upon a combination of the boundary integral equation approach and asymptotic analysis techniques will be developed for rigorous studies of the tightly confined optical wave fields in nano apertures/holes. Computationally, in order to address the significant challenges brought by the extreme scale difference between the aperture size and the wavelength of radiation, fast and high-order horizontal and vertical mode matching numerical schemes will be designed for the simulation of wave propagations in nano-structures. Finally, efficient numerical algorithms based on the inverse scattering theory will be applied for imaging multi-scale subwavelength structures and for breaking the diffraction limit."

Of course, this is only partly true because, at the last moment, your hand contacts glass and the rest of the manipulation is simulated.  For many applications, the glass barrier is an acceptable compromise because the simulated response of the on-screen application to your action (delivered visually) is sufficient to close a perceptual gap, to fool you into believing that you are actually touching a button or icon; the visual feedback serves as proxy for the missing tactile interaction with the object.  However, in some situations, and for some users, the presence of the glass barrier causes the interaction to fail completely.  For blind users in particular, for whom closing a perceptual loop through vision is not an option, other means of interaction with computationally mediated environments must be developed.  The primary objective of this exploratory project is to develop a full-page interactive tactile display that can render what the PIs term ""malleable media"" by combining touch sensing with their existing microfluidic actuators to create a full-page responsive surface.  Such a display could provide an immediate tangible response in reaction to how it is being touched.  By transcending the glass barrier of the screen, such a display would quite literally support a direct manipulation paradigm by making both interface elements, such as buttons and icons, and application content touchable.  Thus, project outcomes are likely to provide greater accessibility to digital media by blind users.  But the sighted community also stands to benefit.  Both students and professionals working in STEM fields require access to increasingly high dimensional data that cannot be easily accessed via speech. An interactive tactile display such as that which is the focus of this work would provide such access, to blind computer users and their sighted counterparts alike.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this exploratory project derives from combining two strands of existing research by the PIs.  The first is their recent work on a microfluidic tactile display, while the second is their established record in applying principles of enactive cognition to the design of human-computer interfaces.  Enactive cognition posits a tight coupling between our actions on the environment and our perception of how the environment is responding.  With the new technology the PIs have the means of creating such an interactive surface, but it is not yet known what such interactions should ""feel"" like.  What would it be like to sculpt an object by molding the surface of a tablet computer with one's hands?  For blind users, this would provide a means for not just feeling tactile objects, but also for creating those objects.  Such objects might be used as new ways of representing, for example, patterns present in complex data sets or of interacting with mathematical models."

Because incremental and inheritable genetic changes happen over multiple generations evolutionary theory is difficult to study. Viruses obey the same basic evolutionary rules as higher organisms, but replicate and evolve much faster. Therefore they provide a near-ideal model system for the  test of evolutionary and selection theories. Viruses are also capable of social interactions which can change their evolutionary behaviors. Social interactions arise by a process called co-infection, whereby multiple virus genomes infect and replicate in a single cell, and can result in a number of poorly understood interactions. The research team will perform a series of integrated experimental and mathematical analyses aimed at providing insights into these complex processes.  This research also has significance to other epidemiological situations in which co-infection patterns are observed when different pathogen species simultaneously infect the same host and impact each others' ability to spread. Thus the novel numerical techniques being developed have relevance and significance in more general health areas including cancer studies. <br/><br/>RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, allowing them to rapidly diversify and readily adapt to environmental challenges. They provide, therefore, a near-ideal model system for the testing of evolutionary and selection theories that are difficult to approach in more complex organisms. Typically, virus genomes are considered as isolated entities, however, multiple infection (coinfection) of cells is a common occurrence and results in a series of poorly understood social interactions that have the power to shape evolutionary trajectories. A highly tractable experimental system for assessing the model is replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in vitro. HIV-1 multiple infection is promoted by cell-to-cell contact and the formation of virological synapses, in which multiple viruses are simultaneously transferred from one cell to another. In contrast, spread via the release of free virus particles promotes single infection. The relative occurrence of synaptic and free virus transmission, and hence infection multiplicity, can be elegantly manipulated with innovative experimental techniques. Several experimental techniques will be used to generate data on virus growth and virus evolution at different infection multiplicities. Transmission pathways (synaptic and free virus) will be manipulated to change infection multiplicity during virus spread. Evolutionary dynamics will be explored in the context of different mutant types that undergo a variety of social interactions. New techniques will be introduced in order to manipulate the relative importance of cell-free and synaptic transmission, and thus infection multiplicity. Novel computational algorithms will be developed in order to fully understand how multiple infection and social interactions impact the dynamics.  Mathematical models will be tested, parameterized, and employed to explore the evolutionary dynamics at large population sizes. This research will provide greater insights on the relative significance of mechanisms that impact evolution of organisms."

Employers, policy makers, and educators agree on the need for engineers who can identify and incorporate into their decision making relevant aspects of systems in which their work is embedded. To date, there is limited research to guide educators in fostering systems thinking, and few of these studies offer clear and comprehensive definitions that can be translated into teaching approaches and learning assessments. This project will develop and test a definition of systems thinking as a holistic approach to problem solving in which linkages and interactions of the engineering problem with its constituent parts, the larger sociocultural context, and potential impacts over time are identified and incorporated into decision making. In the field of engineering, research on systems thinking tends to emphasize the ability to recognize potentially relevant components of an engineering problem, rather than how these components are embedded in broader economic, sociocultural, and temporal contexts that must also inform decision making and solutions. Furthermore, elements of systems thinking, such as an awareness of a particular sociocultural context or the ability to coordinate work among members of a cross-disciplinary team, are not always recognized as core engineering skills. Considering these professional skills as lying outside the core of engineering can alienate individuals whose strengths and passions are related to, for example, engineering systems that consider and impact social change. A broader consideration of what constitutes engineering may be particularly relevant for women and racially/ethnically minoritized students who are more likely to be drawn to work where the social impact is relevant. This study examines systems thinking among diverse individuals across a range of expertise to develop a scenario-based assessment tool that educators and researchers can use to evaluate engineering students' systems thinking competence and can help broaden understandings of what is a core engineering skill. <br/>  <br/>The primary aim of this study is to expand current conceptions of systems thinking within engineering. The project will define and assess systems thinking across a range of expertise and identify life, educational, and work experiences that contribute to this expertise. The study will consist of three phases. Phase 1 consists of interviews with engineering students and practitioners to understand individuals' concrete experiences with systems thinking, the approaches they have used to solve complex engineering problems, and the relationship of their prior life, educational, and work experiences with their systems thinking practice and skill. Phase 2 involves think-aloud interviews in which participants are presented with an open-ended engineering problem scenario and asked to discuss how they would explore a possible solution. This phase allows for the comparison of the strategies individuals with different levels of systems thinking skill employ as they are solving a problem and their rationales for decision making.  This phase will yield an in-depth understanding of different levels of systems thinking ability and provide the empirical foundation for a systems thinking assessment tool. Phase 3 will build on findings from Phases 1 and 2. First, using the empirically grounded classification of the problem-solving approaches associated with different levels of systems thinking ability, Phase 3 will develop and test a scenario-based written assessment tool. This assessment tool will distinguish between levels of systems thinking expertise. Phase 3 will also build on the ongoing examination of how educational and life experiences may be associated with differences in systems thinking ability."

This project will demonstrate that engaging in hypothesis-driven experimental science is a powerful tool in educating students to become scientists.  The objective of the project is to train students to think and act like scientists - to propose hypotheses, to design experiments, to analyze data, to draw conclusions, and to communicate with other scientists.  Students on six campuses (Rochester Institute of Technology, Hope College, California Polytechnic Institute, Ursinus College, St. Mary's University, and SUNY Oswego) will engage in computational and wet lab approaches to predict protein function.  In a previous project, the team of principal investigators created a series of modules to guide student inquiry and video instructions for the computational techniques, which were deployed in biochemistry teaching laboratories across the six campuses.  In the present project, the faculty team will classify and characterize the research behaviors that students display during the course and will develop and validate methods for understanding students' development as scientists.  Because the students are participating in authentic research, results from their experiments will also be collated into a database that can be used by future students to pursue biologically relevant protein functions, such as the potential discovery of drug targets for diseases.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of the project is to introduce cutting-edge biochemistry research into the classroom to investigate whether getting students to participate in hypothesis-driven experimental science is a useful tool in educating students to become scientists.   In this second phase of a course-based undergraduate research experience, students' learning and growth as scientists will be assessed by local biochemistry faculty and evaluated by educational researchers at Purdue University, to ascertain students' understanding of research methods, visualization, biological context, and mechanisms of protein function. The faculty team will develop validated assessment tools to measure these objectives, and will balance the homogeneity of curricular materials needed to ensure sound education with the flexibility needed for adaptation in different institutional settings. The course instructors and project evaluators will collaborate using education research techniques to monitor both students' development of research behaviors and changes in instructors' teaching approaches.  The refined and tested curriculum will then be ready for wider dissemination into the biochemistry teaching community.  The need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education and for the inclusion of a more diverse population is widely recognized.  The project team includes faculty from a Hispanic-serving institution and from an institution with a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students; inclusion of these faculty ensures that the needs and concerns of these communities will be included in the project."

The goal of this research project is to change the way analog circuits are designed by significantly increasing design automation. If successful, it will greatly shorten the time-to-market, increase the system capability, reduce the design cost, and lower the chip failure rate. The proposed research topic bridges the circuit design community with the electronic design automation (EDA) community, initiating collaboration and co-development. On the application side, the proposed novel analog circuit design methodology will serve as the catalyst for emerging applications, such as IoT, 5G cellular communication, wearable electronics, and self-driving vehicles. On the educational side, a new and dedicated course will be developed to facilitate designers to adopt the proposed novel analog IC design methodology. The PIs will also continue their active roles in graduate student mentoring, minority outreach, local community service, and settling up close ties between UT Austin and local industry. <br/><br/><br/>There are two existing analog design flows in existence today. One is the classic manual design methodology. Despite wide acceptance, it has low productivity and low accuracy, which results from the hard fact that human beings are inefficient at complicated numerical computation and multi-dimensional optimization. The other is analog IC design automation (ADA), which treats circuit design as a black-box optimization problem and solves it by powerful optimization algorithms. Despite its high efficiency, ADA has received limited acceptance due to unreliability. The algorithms do not understand circuits, leading to unpractical synthesis results that only make numerical sense. Analog IC design is complex both in high-level reasoning and low-level computation, thus, neither human nor algorithm alone is adequate. To address this dilemma, a new analog IC design methodology that integrates both human and machine intelligence (HMI) is proposed. Its goal is to place the designers at the center and empower them with novel interactive tools. The specific research thrusts of this project include: 1) HMI guided interactive schematic design tools; 2) HMI guided interactive layout design tools; 3) HMI guided interactive analog design methodology and silicon validation; 4) HMI guided interactive circuit architecture selection and creation; 5) overall framework and toolkit."

For electrochemical energy storage devices, daily operation involves the electrochemical insertion and extraction of ions, which is often accompanied by larger structural transformations that may cause the material to collapse. Hence, the search for new electrode materials is necessary in order for future energy storage demands to be realized. Clathrates are a class of materials with cage-like structures that can naturally hold guest ions, a feature that may be exploited in energy storage applications. However, different features in the clathrate bonding arrangement may affect its mechanical integrity. Key objectives of this project are to understand the electrochemical characteristics of these materials, how the structure of the clathrate changes upon electrochemical insertion of guest ions, and the development of new synthetic routes to obtain clathrates. Results from this project enable new knowledge on the intricate relationships among the clathrates' structures and their physical properties, electrochemical characteristics, and structural stability.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The objectives of this project are: (1) to investigate the electrochemical and structural properties of germanium and tin clathrates using first principles calculations and detailed structural characterization to understand the electrochemically obtained structures; and (2) to synthesize new clathrates containing lithium ions from novel precursors. The project uses a concerted approach combining the synthetic, structural and electrochemical characterization, and theoretical expertise of the investigators. The research enables a better understanding of the relationship between the clathrate structure and its physical properties, electrochemical characteristics, and phase stability. These achievements could lead to higher energy density lithium and sodium batteries. The studies also help to build up the predictive power of solid-state chemistry, establishing new ideas of why and how atoms assemble and form new compounds and structures with the desired electrochemical properties. Investigation of these materials involves a collaboration between two universities (Arizona State University and University of Delaware) and three different departments (materials science, chemistry, and physics), which exposes students to multidisciplinary research.

A key unifying concept that links arithmetic and analysis is the notion of an L-function. There are two fundamentally different ways to define L-functions. One way is to count the number of solutions to certain polynomial equations modulo primes, and then to put the resulting numbers into a certain generating function. The other way is to start with highly symmetric solutions to certain differential equations on symmetric manifolds (automorphic forms) and then to define L-functions in terms of these solutions using analysis. The idea of reciprocity in the Langlands program is the conjecture that all L-functions defined in terms of polynomial equations can also be defined in terms of automorphic forms. This conjectural link is expected to have deep implications in both number theory and harmonic analysis.  This research project aims to further explore the reciprocity conjecture and its implications.<br/><br/>Some of the most basic interesting classes of L-functions in arithmetic arise from polynomial equations with integer coefficients in two variables (algebraic curves over the rational numbers). Associated to such a polynomial is an invariant g (the genus) which is a non-negative integer. If the genus g is zero, then the resulting L-function can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function, and reciprocity in this case follows from Riemann's work. If the genus g is one, then the reciprocity conjecture is equivalent to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, now verified. The goal of this project is to make significant progress on the case when the genus g is two."

CMDC is a spectroscopic technique to fingerprint a molecule, which helps scientists to distinguish different molecules present in complex samples.  In this project, Professor Wright uses a pair of laser pulses to create specific responses from different electrons in a molecule and then follow the change of their energy levels over a very wide range of time scales.  He then uses this technique to study how vitamin B12 works and how green plants use sunlight to make oxygen at the molecular level.  Studying these two questions could help us to better understand how human body works and how to harness solar energy more effectively.  Professor Wright also works with an instrument company on the commercialization of the CMDS technique by reducing the cost and make it easier to use by other scientists. Through this project, Professor Wright provides research opportunities to graduate, undergraduate, and secondary school students.  He is also passionate about using active learning methods to prepare future STEM students for better national competitiveness and works closely with summer students from Spelman College. <br/><br/>Professor Wright's project has two specific goals - understanding the enzymatic mechanism for vitamin B12's catalysis of ethanolamine degradation and the mechanism by which the oxygen evolving complex in photosystem II makes oxygen.  The vitamin B12 mechanism serves as a model for understanding enzymatic reactions.  The OEC mechanism is one of the grand challenges of chemistry, particularly for developing solar energy.  For both systems, Professor Wright uses CMDS to create quantum mechanical superpositions of vibrational and electronic states that provide the selectivity and structural details required to define the mechanisms with quantum state resolution.  Specifically, he is working to (1) develop a pump-CMDS probe to create a 3D spectrum; (2) to study the Co-C bond cleavage in a cobalamin-ethanolamine ammonida lyase (EAL)-ethanolamine (EA) complex to investigate the enzymatic reaction converting ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia; and (3) to characterize the electronic and vibrational states of oxygen evolving complexes (OEC) in photosystem II to understand the water oxidation mechanism. In addition, Professor Wright (1) continues his development of active learning methods in undergraduate and graduate courses; (2) works with students from Spelman College through a REU program; and (3) plans to disseminate CMDS through web site tutorials, educational materials, publications and conferences."

In particular, the research will focus on examining the effects that pH, ionic strength, surfactant concentration, and type of counter-ion have on the factors mentioned above.

Because incremental and inheritable genetic changes happen over multiple generations evolutionary theory is difficult to study. Viruses obey the same basic evolutionary rules as higher organisms, but replicate and evolve much faster. Therefore they provide a near-ideal model system for the  test of evolutionary and selection theories. Viruses are also capable of social interactions which can change their evolutionary behaviors. Social interactions arise by a process called co-infection, whereby multiple virus genomes infect and replicate in a single cell, and can result in a number of poorly understood interactions. The research team will perform a series of integrated experimental and mathematical analyses aimed at providing insights into these complex processes.  This research also has significance to other epidemiological situations in which co-infection patterns are observed when different pathogen species simultaneously infect the same host and impact each others' ability to spread. Thus the novel numerical techniques being developed have relevance and significance in more general health areas including cancer studies. <br/><br/>RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, allowing them to rapidly diversify and readily adapt to environmental challenges. They provide, therefore, a near-ideal model system for the testing of evolutionary and selection theories that are difficult to approach in more complex organisms. Typically, virus genomes are considered as isolated entities, however, multiple infection (coinfection) of cells is a common occurrence and results in a series of poorly understood social interactions that have the power to shape evolutionary trajectories. A highly tractable experimental system for assessing the model is replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in vitro. HIV-1 multiple infection is promoted by cell-to-cell contact and the formation of virological synapses, in which multiple viruses are simultaneously transferred from one cell to another. In contrast, spread via the release of free virus particles promotes single infection. The relative occurrence of synaptic and free virus transmission, and hence infection multiplicity, can be elegantly manipulated with innovative experimental techniques. Several experimental techniques will be used to generate data on virus growth and virus evolution at different infection multiplicities. Transmission pathways (synaptic and free virus) will be manipulated to change infection multiplicity during virus spread. Evolutionary dynamics will be explored in the context of different mutant types that undergo a variety of social interactions. New techniques will be introduced in order to manipulate the relative importance of cell-free and synaptic transmission, and thus infection multiplicity. Novel computational algorithms will be developed in order to fully understand how multiple infection and social interactions impact the dynamics.  Mathematical models will be tested, parameterized, and employed to explore the evolutionary dynamics at large population sizes. This research will provide greater insights on the relative significance of mechanisms that impact evolution of organisms."

But despite being so commonplace, understanding and modeling turbulence remains a significant challenge. Turbulent flows are distinct from more general unsteady flows because they display a characteristic cascade of energy from the large length scales at which energy is generated to the small length scales on which it is dissipated by viscosity. Typically, this process is described in an abstract way that makes it difficult to appreciate the underlying physics. The goal of this proposed research is to recast the turbulent energy cascade as a mechanical process, where large scales do work on the small scales. This model immediately emphasizes the important role played by geometry, since if the forces provided by the large scales are misaligned with the flow direction, they can do no work. In this proposed research, the geometry of the turbulent cascade will be studied in detail and its links to other turbulent processes will be clarified. Ultimately, the results of this research may lead to new strategies for turbulence modeling. The proposed research will support the education and training of graduate students, and the results will be folded into existing graduate courses. Additionally, the supported scientists will participate in educational outreach activities coordinate through Stanford's Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory.   <br/><br/>The objective of this proposed research is to gain a deeper understanding of how the geometric properties of scale-dependent turbulent stresses and strain rates and, in particular, their relative alignment control the turbulent cascade. Specifically, the alignment and possible spatial ordering of the turbulent stress and strain rate will be characterized, an understanding of how this alignment is modulated by advection will be developed, and potential links between alignment and intermittency will be investigated. These questions will be studied via theoretical work and analysis of data sets for three-dimensional turbulence, two-dimensional turbulence, and unsteady, random, and multiscale but non-turbulent velocity fields. By basing this research on sound and transparent mechanical principles of work and energy transfer, the results will bring new clarity to the origins of the detailed structure of turbulence that is more interpretable than abstract approaches such as multifractality."

Professors Daniel Esposito and John Wright of Columbia University are developing new approaches to scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) that will enable high resolution chemical imaging over large areas. SECM is a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technique that has become invaluable for studying chemical processes across the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. Despite the success of SECM, it is not well suited for high resolution imaging over large areas. This limitation arises because conventional electrochemical probes are scanned in a sequential, point-by-point manner across the area of interest, meaning that high resolution imaging over large areas takes prohibitively long times to complete. The current project aims to break these tradeoffs and enable efficient, high-resolution imaging of large samples by using a combination of new sensing strategies and advanced signal reconstruction methodologies. This approach will greatly reduce imaging times and thereby expand the utility of SECM for many applications. The research plans are tightly integrated with educational and outreach activities.<br/><br/>SECM has become an invaluable tool in many fields of study. However, a major shortcoming of SECM, shared by many SPM techniques, is the trade-off between spatial resolution and areal scan rates. SECM imaging is commonly performed with nanoscale resolution, but such high resolution imaging is typically limited to very small areas (typically << square millimeters). The slow areal scan rates of conventional SECM arise from the fact that the scanning ?point probes?, or ultramicroelectrodes, must be scanned across every (X,Y) location within in an area of interest in a sequential, one-at-a-time manner. This project aims to develop a new approach to SECM imaging that combines i.) non-local continuous line probes (CLPs) and ii.) advanced compressed sensing (CS) signal analysis techniques. While the CLP geometry enables SECM signal to be rapidly measured over large areas, CS serves the critical role of constructing images from the convoluted SECM signal generated by the CLP. The project is organized around three primary objectives: i.) demonstrating the core benefits of combining CLP-SECM with CS, ii.) establishing the theoretical and practical limits of this new approach, and iii.) achieving chemical imaging with nanoscale resolution over macroscopic areas. Research and education are tightly integrated within this interdisciplinary research project, with a strong emphasis on educational activities and workforce training that targets the emerging industries in nanotechnology and signal processing / data analytics."

In typical metals, a fraction of the electrons disassociate from individual atoms and migrate through the system, while in other materials all electrons remain localized. In either case, the electrons give materials the electric and magnetic properties that are exploited in electronics and other technological applications. This project aims at increasing our understanding of the ways in which electrons can form a wealth of different complex states due to their interactions with each other. The interactions are electromagnetic in nature, and depend on the environment in which the electrons are embedded, i.e. the specific material and its external conditions. In the same way as water can appear in three different common phases (liquid, gas, and solid), electrons can also transition between states with completely different properties by changing their environment, e.g. by applying pressure or an external magnetic field. Being microscopic particles, the motion and interactions of electrons are governed by quantum mechanics, and it is technically extremely challenging to construct tractable theoretical models to describe them, and to understand and exploit their different phases and properties. <br/><br/>In this project, a set of models relevant to materials with localized electrons are studied via large-scale computer simulations. The arrangement of the spins (magnetic moments) of the electrons in different patterns is determined by how they interact with each other. At the heart of the project is understanding the way a state having a pattern of ordered spins can ""melt"", i.e. go into a disordered state, or go into another type of ordered state. Progress in fundamental understanding is important for achieving further fundamental advances as well as applications.<br/><br/>In addition to its scientific goals, the project involves training graduate students in state-of-the-art modeling and computer simulations, and creating user-friendly software for other researchers by applying the methods and models developed.

In this project, minimalistic lattice models are used to capture universal phenomena of experimental and theoretical relevance, and unbiased numerical tools are employed to obtain conclusive results for generic properties of ground states, excitations, and critical scaling. In the absence of rigorous analytical solutions, such numerically exact results are invaluable as cornerstones of our understanding of quantum materials. An interrelated set of investigations are proposed to address some of the most intriguing aspects of quantum phase transitions beyond the conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Unbiased numerical simulations will be carried out on several lattice models in which a second length scale appears alongside the conventional correlation length upon approaching a quantum critical point.<br/><br/>Building on previous work, a scaling hypothesis involving two simultaneously divergent length scales at the AFM-VBS transition will be further tested within the class of J-Q models proposed previously by the PI, with the goal of firmly establishing the proposed relationships between exponents appearing in finite-size and finite-temperature scaling forms. Moreover, a new class of quantum clock models are proposed as a potentially simpler class of systems in which to investigate and understand the origin of the anomalous two-length scaling. More detailed studies of J-Q models will also be carried out, including studying the effects of disorder at the critical point and in the two ordered phases. In order to facilitate QMC studies of dynamic properties, work will be carried out on a stochastic analytic continuation method, which shows promise towards delivering better frequency resolution than other analytic continuation methods used so far.<br/><br/>In addition to its scientific goals, the project involves training graduate students in state-of-the-art modeling and computer simulations, and creating user-friendly software for other researchers by applying the methods and models developed.

Significant advancement in our understanding of the CCSN mechanism has occurred in the last decade, highlighted by the understanding that the CCSN problem involves the complex interaction of many physical inputs that can only be fully considered in three-dimensional (3D) simulations. The number of 3D simulations, which include sufficient realistic physics, that have been completed is still small and the simulations are generally under-resolved. Recent observational surveys have greatly increased the number of well observed CCSN and identified many of the pre-supernova stars, establishing a more direct relationship between the characteristics and the details of the explosion.<br/><br/>This project will survey the range of the stellar mass of CCSN progenitors using the state-of-the-art CCSN code Chimera on the Blue Waters system to understand how the variations in pre-supernova structure affect the explosive outcomes. The simulations will begin from progenitor stars that span the range of stellar masses from the lightest to heaviest stars that might explode. The progenitor star models will be from the first generation of stars formed from the primordial gas of the Big Bang as there exists a class of second-generation stars contaminated by only the ejecta of first-generation supernovae that offer a unique opportunity to measure the ejected products of individual CCSN. This choice offers an important contrast to prior studies which have focused on metal-rich stars. The project will compute five 3D simulations over the course of 2 years with 1-degree resolution. This surpasses the resolution of any current self-consistent, full-physics CCSN simulation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include the engagement of local and visiting students (graduate and undergraduate) and post-docs, providing training in both astrophysics and high-performance computing that our students and post-docs carry with them to later jobs in academia and industry.

The focus is on problems in high-dimensional linear algebra and non-linear optimization.  Quickly checkable proofs can also expose bugs/faults in time- and space-consuming server computations.   <br/>2.  Medical image processing needs robust interpolation from values sampled at points; The project will reconstruct functions as sparse sums of a few exponentials or orthogonal polynomials, using algorithms that account for noise and outliers (that is, catastrophic errors) while minimizing the number of sample points.  <br/>3. In fundamental problems in algebraic computational complexity, it takes a fresh look at polynomial multiplication and greatest common divisors.<br/><br/>The PI continues to train undergraduate and Master students, and supervise Ph.D. students and a postdoctoral scholar, so that they develop advanced skills in designing algorithms and computer programs for doing mathematics.  The students and postdoc will be encouraged to adopt advanced research communication skills by presenting posters and talks at international meetings, especially when their background is from under-represented groups in the discipline.<br/><br/>The method to achieve the goal of low-cost certification is to develop certificates for the Frobenius form of sparse matrices and for the solvability of polynomial equations over the real numbers that are independent of the algorithms that produce the output.  The approach is based on interactive proof protocols and crytographic hardness assumptions, but the project aims to reduce the use of cryptography in its protocols, so that the verifier can increase probability of correctness arbitrarily, even after the computation.  The PI has used algebraic error correcting decoding to locate evaluation errors in sparse interpolation and dense rational vector recovery, the latter with early termination.  The current focus is on sparseness in a Chebyshev basis, where list-decoders are missing, and on multivariate sparse interpolation using a generalization of Prony's Algorithm combined with Sakata's generalization of the Berlekamp/Massey Algorithm.  Finally, the project studies the algebraic complexity of multiplying polynomials without the use of constants, computing the Sylvester resultant without divisions, and representing polynomials as the characteristic polynomial of matrices."

In some cases ions can also bind with uncharged polymers in non-water-based media to greatly modify the structure and material properties of the polymers. For instance, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), an uncharged water-soluble polymer with extensive commercial applications, can dissolve salts, such as lithium chloride, in non-aqueous solvents to produce PEO-ion complex with high ion conductivity as solid polymer electrolyte for Li-ion rechargeable battery applications. Despite enormous technical implications of ion binding with neutral polymers the charging mechanism of neutral polymers in organic solvents and in the solid state remains poorly understood. This project aims to control and quantify the electrical charge density and complex formation of PEO polymers with inorganic nanometer-sized ions (macroions) of varied electrical charges and concentration by ultrafast laser spectroscopic methods. With this knowledge, ion-containing polymers with enhanced mechanical and ion transport properties can be developed (including earth-abundant or conventional synthetic polymers in various solvents and in the solid state) into novel functional materials that may be relevant for energy and environmental aspects. This project also combines multifaceted STEM education, where classroom and video demonstrations and hand-on experiences will be developed to engage graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students in fundamental materials design and advanced materials-characterization tools.

However, electrical charges can be also introduced to neutral polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), upon ion binding in non-aqueous solvents and in the solid state, resulting in unusual polyelectrolyte-like behaviors of the neutral polymers. This is a much less studied area, and this project aims to elucidate the process of effectively charging neutral polymers by multivalent macroions, leading to the formation of polymer-macroion complexes with enhanced solid-like mechanical strength and fast ion transport. In particular, the electric potential and complex formation of PEO polymers upon binding with hydrophilic inorganic macroions of varied multi-valence and concentration will be quantified by ultrafast laser spectroscopy to fundamentally understand the electrical charging process of neutral polymers in organic solvents and the solid state. The relationship among phase structure, viscoelasticity, and ion conductivity of PEO-macroion complexes will be established and exploited to enhance the mechanical strength and ion transport of the complexes with optimal macroion content. The success of this project could have implications toward a versatile and sustainable material process of earth-abundant or conventional synthetic neutral polymers into advanced functional ion-containing polymers with enhanced ion transport and mechanical integrity."

In a previous project, the team of principal investigators created a series of modules to guide student inquiry and video instructions for the computational techniques, which were deployed in biochemistry teaching laboratories across the six campuses.  In the present project, the faculty team will classify and characterize the research behaviors that students display during the course and will develop and validate methods for understanding students' development as scientists.  Because the students are participating in authentic research, results from their experiments will also be collated into a database that can be used by future students to pursue biologically relevant protein functions, such as the potential discovery of drug targets for diseases.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of the project is to introduce cutting-edge biochemistry research into the classroom to investigate whether getting students to participate in hypothesis-driven experimental science is a useful tool in educating students to become scientists.   In this second phase of a course-based undergraduate research experience, students' learning and growth as scientists will be assessed by local biochemistry faculty and evaluated by educational researchers at Purdue University, to ascertain students' understanding of research methods, visualization, biological context, and mechanisms of protein function. The faculty team will develop validated assessment tools to measure these objectives, and will balance the homogeneity of curricular materials needed to ensure sound education with the flexibility needed for adaptation in different institutional settings. The course instructors and project evaluators will collaborate using education research techniques to monitor both students' development of research behaviors and changes in instructors' teaching approaches.  The refined and tested curriculum will then be ready for wider dissemination into the biochemistry teaching community.  The need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education and for the inclusion of a more diverse population is widely recognized.  The project team includes faculty from a Hispanic-serving institution and from an institution with a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students; inclusion of these faculty ensures that the needs and concerns of these communities will be included in the project."

Professor Li and her team focus on the study of how the structures and the concentrations of neuropeptides in a crab change under the lack of oxygen (hypoxia) or under acidic or basic conditions (pH stress).  As neuropeptides represent one of the most diverse and essential classes of molecules that regulate various physiological processes, new approaches and techniques are needed to enable a more complete description of these signaling molecules and quantify their changes in response to environmental stressors.  Professor Li and her group develop a set of tools based on ion-mobility mass spectrometry to separate different peptides of different size-to-charge ratios.  Cataloging different peptides detected will then help to understand their roles in the brain.  The funded research takes advantage of the power of analytical chemistry tools to advance neuroscience research.  It provides excellent training opportunities to graduate students and undergraduate students in Professor Li's group to pursue a research career at the interface of chemistry and neuroscience.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to exploit novel use of the powerful ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) technology to address several remaining technical challenges facing neuropeptide research.  Specifically, Professor Li and her team are funded to develop a novel multi-pronged approach based on IM-MS coupling to microseparations, high-performance MS, and molecular dynamic simulations for large-scale discovery, quantitation and structural elucidation of neuropeptides. They plan to improve methodologies for ion mobility assisted large-scale peptidomic analysis and accurate quantitation, its coupling to various microseparation platforms and mass spectral imaging for comprehensive neuropeptide analysis. Furthermore, they will develop a unique IM-MS based strategies to probe novel posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of neuropeptides such as D/L-peptide epimers and O-linked glycosylation.  The new methodology is to improve neurochemical signaling analysis in response to hypoxia and pH stress.  The technological advancements resulting from this proposal will be applicable to large-scale analysis of biochemical and peptidergic signaling in many nervous systems, including humans.  The molecular insights gained from probing neurochemistry in response to stress could lead to a better understanding of neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to environmental stress, a process that is highly conserved among all organisms to maintain their survival in the face of both externally and internally generated ""stimuli""."

This process is of growing importance as the creation and  manufacturing of complex 3-D products ranging from custom prosthetics and medical implants to warfighter engine parts becomes individualized and on-demand. Technicians working in 3-D printing must be highly skilled and adaptable to leverage this evolving technology across industries. Because of this growing demand, this project at Harford Community College (HCC) entitled the Regional Additive Manufacturing Pathway (RAMP) is designed to create an AM career pathway to increase the number of AM technicians in the rural region of northeast Maryland. To ensure that training is aligned with the needs of the regional manufacturing industry, RAMP will work with industry, the United States Military Base-Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), the Regional Additive Manufacturing Partnership of Maryland (RAMP MD) and the NSF/ATE National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEdU). RAMP will focus on developing AM technicians with versatile 21st century skills in 3-D printing by collaborating with RAMP MD, a network of more than 150 manufacturers, scientists, educators and entrepreneurs in AM, with the collective goal of building the AM manufacturing base and educating the AM workforce. RAMP will place particular emphasis on a crosswalk of AM core competencies with the knowledge and skills required to work in the defense/military industry as an alignment of AM technician competencies needed in the defense/military industry has not yet been done. Project evaluation will track progress on technician training and its impact on the technician workforce. Dissemination strategies will include presentations at the annual RAMP MD Symposium to share project information and to expand the industry base of support. HCC will also share materials developed with MatEdU to be accessed on the Technician Education in Additive Manufacturing & Materials (TEAMM) website. Deliverables include the additive manufacturing certificate program, with a military/defense skills crosswalk that can be replicated by other colleges. RAMP will also engage rural students in AM technician training and 21st century problem solving skills. As a result, this project will provide a model of program development for other colleges in rural areas, who are considering dual enrollment in AM technician education and training.<br/><br/>RAMP targets several ATE tracks including Program Development and Improvement, Curriculum and Educational Materials Development, and Professional Development for Educators. To achieve its goals RAMP will: 1) Develop and implement the AM certificate dual enrollment program; 2) Provide professional development to postsecondary faculty; and 3) Expand opportunities for rural high school students to engage in AM technologies. Dual enrollment will strengthen the AM career pathway from secondary to postsecondary education or directly into the workforce. Professional development will provide college faculty with access to the latest developments in AM pedagogy and technology from MatEdU. Rural high school students will be engaged through AM summer seminars, visits to industry, and 3-D printing kits. RAMP will work with Harford County Public Schools (HCPS) and partners to build a dual enrollment AM curriculum. It will use the DACUM process to determine local AM skills and competencies required by academia and industry, and then crosswalk the DACUM profile with AM core competencies created by MatEdU. The college is committed to the long-term success of AM technician training by maintaining sustainable partnerships with regional AM business and industry, APG, and MatEdU."

This investigation is informed by close engagement with industry and understanding of the needs and requirements of protecting users' data.<br/><br/>This project comprises three research thrusts, spanning the range from theoretical foundations to security analysis to design and implementation of prototype systems.  The first thrust develops cryptographic definitions and security models for property-revealing encryption (PRE) schemes, as well as developing a hierarchy of threat models and inference methods.  The second thrust focuses on developing a unified methodology for measuring and exploiting information leakage when PRE schemes are deployed on realistic data in actual distributed systems. The final thrust designs and implements secure systems that use cryptographic data protection safely and securely, focusing on a small number of key applications that showcase essential PRE functionality."

The forum will bring together specialists in structural geology and tectonics for oral and poster presentations, field trips, and short courses. The Structural Geology and Tectonics Program provides the framework for the structural geology and tectonics community to communicate, develop, and advance teaching and research among educators and investigators. These forums play a key role in identifying key pedagogical advances and methods applied to structural geology and tectonics, important science questions in structural geology and tectonics, while initiating collaborative relationships to address these questions, and early career geoscientists while supporting them. The meeting will include three days of presentations that will include technical sessions that will include topics such as the evolution of crustal shear zones, new developments in the tectonic evolution of western North America, and effective teaching methods for structural geology and tectonics. Each session will highlight an important area of current research and/or education, will be anchored by a distinguished keynote speaker, and will showcase relevance of work on the topic. Poster sessions with abundant time for full participant interaction will accompany each session. The forum will be organized to maximize the exchange of ideas between participants in open discussions. Sessions will provide ample opportunity to ask questions of individual presenters, assess the current state of our knowledge, and consider productive areas for future research. In addition to the formal meeting, there will be field trips to examine the geology of selected areas near Tempe, as well as an optional meeting to examine the geology of the southern San Andreas Fault of California. Short course topics will include use of high resolution topography and Earth observation, digital applications to field geology, geostatistics applied to geological mapping and fieldwork, experimental rock deformation, and structural geology laboratory exercises and software. <br/><br/>The Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum is designed to facilitate community building and personal interaction within different segments of the structural geology community. It will bring together faculty from research universities, liberal arts colleges, community and two-year colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Importantly, there will be group discussions on critical developments in structural geology and tectonics, and what future research priorities should be. This community building effort will help create a stronger, more vibrant group of scientists and help introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to the structural geology and tectonics disciplines. The setting will be particularly useful for graduate students, who will be able to use the venue and informal nature of the forum to find out what research is taking place at other institutions, meet a wide range of faculty, and develop useful contacts which will be of great value to their future careers. Students will be able to present their own work in a friendly environment where they can obtain thoughtful and useful feedback, as well as providing opportunity to build new scientific collaborations. Abstracts, field guides, and short course notes will be disseminated through a dedicated website that will be publicly accessible. Continued support for the Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum contribute to the long-term health, vitality, and infrastructure of the Earth Science community. The Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum benefits society and advances desired societal outcomes by its emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and educator development at a variety of levels, by contributing to the training of the next generation of scientists, by contributing to the broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM, and by contributing to the advancement of scientific literacy of the public.

In addition, historically marginalized groups, including women, African Americans, and Hispanics, are vastly underrepresented in the STEM workforce.  Research indicates that the reasons why women and historically marginalized students of color are unable or unwilling to pursue STEM majors are complex and multifaceted. One common factor often cited in the literature is the nature and quality of college mathematics instruction. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that the culture surrounding mathematics institutions, such as messages about mathematical ability being innate and the focus on individual competition, deters women and students of color. This suggests critical questions: What specific patterns of peer and instructor interactions contribute to or reinforce this mathematics learning culture? Why does this quality of instruction have a larger negative impact on women and students of color? What, specifically, makes this instruction inadequate in meeting the academic and social needs of underrepresented groups in mathematics? Do instructors recognize these actions as contributing to this underrepresentation in mathematics? Knowing the answers to these questions will contribute to creating more equitable mathematics learning environments at the undergraduate level and increasing the number of STEM majors to meet the demands of the national workforce. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Engaged Student Learning project, Challenging, Operationalizing and Understanding Racialized and Gendered Experiences (COURAGE) in Undergraduate Mathematics is designed to begin the process of finding these answers.<br/><br/>	There is little research on the relationship between undergraduate mathematics instruction and the retention and achievement of groups that are historically underrepresented in mathematics; other scholars have noted that research in this area is sparse and urgently needed. In order to study this relationship, this research project uses a mixed-methods design. The intellectual merit of COURAGE is directly related to the opportunity to advance knowledge in this under-examined area of STEM education, the design of the research project itself and the qualifications of the personnel involved. In the first year, through observational study and stimulus-recall interviews, the investigators will identify specific events in pre-calculus and calculus classrooms that women and students of color find potentially marginalizing, and will investigate the perceptions of these events from the vantage points of undergraduate mathematics instructors as well as students who are adequately represented and underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. In the second year, quantitative studies using focus group interviews and surveys will be conducted to assess the generalizability of these findings. In particular, videotaped classroom events will be presented to a national sample of undergraduate students and mathematics course instructors, to see the extent to which they find these instructional events to be typical, desirable, or problematic. In the third year, professional development materials will be designed and then piloted with instructors that intend to create more equitable learning environments in undergraduate mathematics classrooms. A critical outcome of this work will be a collection of materials including a synthesis of typical events in undergraduate mathematics classrooms that marginalize students, various students' documented perceptions of classroom events, and recommended instructional practices for more equitably responding to their occurrences that can be shared widely to the benefit of the broader STEM education community."

MSMU?s partnership with the University of Southern California (USC) expands environmental and geoscience opportunities for female, underrepresented, low-income, predominantly first-generation college students. Leveraging the STEM capacity of USC and its Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island, the project will generate greater academic interest and awareness among early-level MSMU undergraduates in geoscience and environmental fields. It will also provide participants with the academic and field experience necessary to succeed in advanced degree programs and careers in these fields.<br/><br/>Underrepresented minority university students enter majors in STEM fields at a similar rate to other students, but completion rates are lower (National Academies, 2011). MSMU?s GEOPATHS program provides female, minority, low-income, predominantly first-generation college students with undergraduate hands-on research experiences, active learning in introductory courses, and membership in a STEM learning community aimed at increasing interest in the sciences and improving student outcomes. The GEOPATHS program will recruit early undergraduates at MSMU for year-round catalytic experiences designed to: 1) introduce participants to oceanography and environmental science fields through project-based learning at USC?s marine research station on Catalina Island, 2) conduct field/laboratory studies mentored by faculty and researchers, 3) build expertise and confidence for subsequent participation in national programs and advanced USC courses not available at MSMU, and 4) inform students about geoscience graduate school and workforce opportunities. At the same time, the program will fortify MSMU?s goals to develop an environmental science track for students, develop cross-campus practices between USC and MSMU geoscience programs, and broaden USC?s ongoing initiatives to attract diverse populations into STEM graduate programs. Through these activities, the project intends to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge concerning strategies for entraining and retaining underrepresented students in geosciences majors and career paths.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>Research indicates a lack of racial and ethnic diversity in graduate STEM programs and among STEM faculty. In particular, the geosciences are cited as having the lowest diversity of all the STEM fields at all levels of higher education (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2015). In 2010, while 20% of all U.S. bachelor?s degrees were awarded to underrepresented minorities, fewer than 7% of geoscience bachelor?s degrees were awarded to the same groups (Stokes et al., 2014). These statistics highlight the need for creative investments in evidence-based and evidence-generating strategies to broaden geoscience access and improve retention among underrepresented groups. Mount Saint Mary?s University?s (MSMU) GEOPATHS-EXTRA program will expand environmental and geoscience opportunities for underrepresented and predominantly first-generation female college students in Los Angeles, California. This will be accomplished via a sustainable, scalable partnership between MSMU?a minority-serving geosciences-limited 2-year/4-year women's institution?and the University of Southern California (USC)?a large R1 university.<br/><br/>The project will leverage USC?s significant STEM capacity to engage MSMU students in geoscience extracurricular activities, and will evaluate the success of such strategies for entraining and retaining students from a geoscience-limited institution in STEM majors and career paths. The program will enroll 14 MSMU students per annual cohort, directly impacting a total of 42 students?predominately Biological Sciences majors, with priority to first-generation and underrepresented students. Programming at MSMU and USC campuses will be scaffolded to extend MSMU introductory STEM coursework, providing diversified teaching methods and emphasizing 1) early research experiences, 2) active learning, and 3) membership in STEM learning communities. The program will provide students with catalytic experiences to: 1) introduce oceanography and environmental science fields through project based learning at USC's marine station, the Wrigley Marine Science Center ; 2) conduct field/laboratory studies mentored by USC and MSMU faculty and researchers; 3) build expertise and confidence for subsequent participation in national programs and advanced USC courses not available at MSMU; and 4) inform students about geoscience graduate school and workforce opportunities. Assessments will contribute to the knowledge base by 1) documenting the efficacy of project activities on student retention in STEM courses and majors; 2) reinforcing minority STEM identities; 3) promoting peer and professional networks; 4) bridging MSMU's introductory STEM curriculum with external geoscience research opportunities and upper-division USC courses; and 5) enhancing student preparedness and increasing interest in geoscience graduate programs and careers.<br/><br/>MSMU?s GEOPATHS program aims to increase the number and diversity of geoscience-prepared and engaged undergraduates. Furthermore, its broader contribution will be a formalized, scalable and replicable cross-institutional partnership model designed to improve student outcomes and increase interest and success in geoscience careers and graduate study."

However, today's Internet operates with the address-based TCP/IP protocol architecture developed 40 years ago, which greatly limits the full promises of these new applications. Thus, current AR implementations face challenges in performance, scalability and  availability upon disasters.  This proposed research project (ICE-AR) aims to develop a new wireless network architecture to address these limitations and provide pervasive support for these emerging applications.<br/><br/>The ICE-AR project team will apply and extend six years of research efforts on Named Data Networking (NDN), a realization of the Information Centric Networking (ICN) vision, to create this new architecture.  The design emphasizes application-level data naming, data-centric security and computing, asynchronous publishing and consumption, and efficient use of local and proximate resources. The architecture will unify latest advances in wireless communication with domain-specific computing technologies to accelerate AR at the wireless edge and deliver robust performance, with or without the pre-deployed infrastructure support."

In familiar metals like copper or silver, electrical conduction occurs via the motion of a liquid of electrons through the crystal of atoms, with the quantum motion of each electron largely independent of the other electrons. However, in many modern quantum materials, and especially in the cuprate compounds which display high temperature superconductivity, the motion of an electron is correlated with that of other electrons. This correlation is of a subtle non-local quantum variety, often referred to as quantum entanglement, in which observation of one electron can determine the state of other well-separated electrons. In this project, the PI will focus on studying and classifying states of electrons with complex varieties of long-range quantum entanglement. Understanding such metallic states is required to predict the critical temperature for high temperature superconductivity, as superconductivity emerges from such a `strange' metal upon lowering the temperature. Superconductors exhibit the ability to conduct electricity without resistance when the temperature is lowered through the superconducting transition temperature. With transition temperatures near the temperature where liquid oxygen boils, high temperature superconductors still exhibit superconductivity at much higher temperatures than traditional superconductors but still very much below room temperature.  More fundamentally, theoretical research in combination with experimental observations, is expected to lead to a deeper understanding of the structure of quantum matter. The research supported by this award will be coupled with public lectures, articles in popular science journals, lectures at schools for advanced students. The research will be conducted by a group of students and postdoctoral fellows drawn from institutions around the world.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education to investigate the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality, and broken symmetry in interesting metallic materials.  Lattice models will be developed that are amenable to analytical study and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The PI aims to describe the transition between metallic states with and without quantum entanglement, and the role of topological order. The theory of the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality, and broken symmetry is fairly well-developed in insulators; the PI proposes a program to extend such theories to metals. Reliable analytic and numerical tools will lead to a description of the phase diagrams of such metals, and of quantum phase transitions involving changes in Fermi surface size linked to the development of topological order. The effect of disorder on correlated metallic states will be examined, building upon the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a strange metal that had been originally proposed by the PI. Disorder plays a crucial role in the electrical and thermal conductivities of metals, and these conductivities will be computed in correlated states. New analytic tools will be developed to analyze the dynamics of metals without quasiparticle excitations. Collaborations with a number of experimental groups will allow comparison of theories to observations in the cuprate and pnictide superconductors and closely related materials, graphene, and other modern materials."

Of course, this is only partly true because, at the last moment, your hand contacts glass and the rest of the manipulation is simulated.  For many applications, the glass barrier is an acceptable compromise because the simulated response of the on-screen application to your action (delivered visually) is sufficient to close a perceptual gap, to fool you into believing that you are actually touching a button or icon; the visual feedback serves as proxy for the missing tactile interaction with the object.  However, in some situations, and for some users, the presence of the glass barrier causes the interaction to fail completely.  For blind users in particular, for whom closing a perceptual loop through vision is not an option, other means of interaction with computationally mediated environments must be developed.  The primary objective of this exploratory project is to develop a full-page interactive tactile display that can render what the PIs term ""malleable media"" by combining touch sensing with their existing microfluidic actuators to create a full-page responsive surface.  Such a display could provide an immediate tangible response in reaction to how it is being touched.  By transcending the glass barrier of the screen, such a display would quite literally support a direct manipulation paradigm by making both interface elements, such as buttons and icons, and application content touchable.  Thus, project outcomes are likely to provide greater accessibility to digital media by blind users.  But the sighted community also stands to benefit.  Both students and professionals working in STEM fields require access to increasingly high dimensional data that cannot be easily accessed via speech. An interactive tactile display such as that which is the focus of this work would provide such access, to blind computer users and their sighted counterparts alike.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this exploratory project derives from combining two strands of existing research by the PIs.  The first is their recent work on a microfluidic tactile display, while the second is their established record in applying principles of enactive cognition to the design of human-computer interfaces.  Enactive cognition posits a tight coupling between our actions on the environment and our perception of how the environment is responding.  With the new technology the PIs have the means of creating such an interactive surface, but it is not yet known what such interactions should ""feel"" like.  What would it be like to sculpt an object by molding the surface of a tablet computer with one's hands?  For blind users, this would provide a means for not just feeling tactile objects, but also for creating those objects.  Such objects might be used as new ways of representing, for example, patterns present in complex data sets or of interacting with mathematical models."

In addition, historically marginalized groups, including women, African Americans, and Hispanics, are vastly underrepresented in the STEM workforce.  Research indicates that the reasons why women and historically marginalized students of color are unable or unwilling to pursue STEM majors are complex and multifaceted. One common factor often cited in the literature is the nature and quality of college mathematics instruction. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that the culture surrounding mathematics institutions, such as messages about mathematical ability being innate and the focus on individual competition, deters women and students of color. This suggests critical questions: What specific patterns of peer and instructor interactions contribute to or reinforce this mathematics learning culture? Why does this quality of instruction have a larger negative impact on women and students of color? What, specifically, makes this instruction inadequate in meeting the academic and social needs of underrepresented groups in mathematics? Do instructors recognize these actions as contributing to this underrepresentation in mathematics? Knowing the answers to these questions will contribute to creating more equitable mathematics learning environments at the undergraduate level and increasing the number of STEM majors to meet the demands of the national workforce. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Engaged Student Learning project, Challenging, Operationalizing and Understanding Racialized and Gendered Experiences (COURAGE) in Undergraduate Mathematics is designed to begin the process of finding these answers.<br/><br/>	There is little research on the relationship between undergraduate mathematics instruction and the retention and achievement of groups that are historically underrepresented in mathematics; other scholars have noted that research in this area is sparse and urgently needed. In order to study this relationship, this research project uses a mixed-methods design. The intellectual merit of COURAGE is directly related to the opportunity to advance knowledge in this under-examined area of STEM education, the design of the research project itself and the qualifications of the personnel involved. In the first year, through observational study and stimulus-recall interviews, the investigators will identify specific events in pre-calculus and calculus classrooms that women and students of color find potentially marginalizing, and will investigate the perceptions of these events from the vantage points of undergraduate mathematics instructors as well as students who are adequately represented and underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. In the second year, quantitative studies using focus group interviews and surveys will be conducted to assess the generalizability of these findings. In particular, videotaped classroom events will be presented to a national sample of undergraduate students and mathematics course instructors, to see the extent to which they find these instructional events to be typical, desirable, or problematic. In the third year, professional development materials will be designed and then piloted with instructors that intend to create more equitable learning environments in undergraduate mathematics classrooms. A critical outcome of this work will be a collection of materials including a synthesis of typical events in undergraduate mathematics classrooms that marginalize students, various students' documented perceptions of classroom events, and recommended instructional practices for more equitably responding to their occurrences that can be shared widely to the benefit of the broader STEM education community."

This project will aggressively recruit strong STEM majors during their first two years of college to participate in early experiences related to teaching in grades 5-12. Students then will be recruited from this pool of interested and qualified STEM majors to receive scholarship support in the junior and senior year as EWU Noyce Scholars who will earn both a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and a Bachelor's of Arts in Education. Ultimately, at least 33 STEM majors will become certified to teach through this project. In doing so, the project will increase the number of teachers from a variety of STEM disciplines and from under-represented populations. In addition to the early engagement of potential pre-service candidates in the freshman and sophomore years, another signature feature of this project that will have lasting effects is that it will increase collaboration across K-12, community colleges, and EWU. A key project design element develops strong collaboration among faculty in mathematics, science, and teacher education, which will positively affect the teacher preparation program at EWU, and ultimately increase knowledge in the larger teacher education community. Other impacts on the program and the region arise from continued support for teacher development through their first two years of teaching. The induction activities will allow for continued connections among partners, strengthening teacher preparation, teacher educator knowledge, the pipeline of potential STEM teachers from community colleges, and K-12 teacher development. <br/><br/>The freshman and sophomore STEM majors will be recruited from EWU and EWU's primary feeder community colleges, Spokane Falls Community College and Spokane Community College, to participate in early experiences, which include: an early practicum in Spokane Public Schools (SPS), the partner high-need school district, and the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program; serving as volunteers for 5-12 mathematics and science events held at EWU; and joining junior and senior Noyce Scholars in activities such as Inquiry Circles and attending Undergraduate Research Symposia. This five-year project will: increase the number of teachers who graduate from EWU with a degree in a STEM discipline and are certified to teach; increase the number of Noyce Scholars from physics, geoscience, chemistry, and mathematics; prepare Noyce Scholars to understand and effectively apply pedagogy emphasizing Standards for Mathematical Practices (SMP) and Science and Engineering Practices (SEP) to improve student learning in their classrooms; and increase the capacity and dispositions of secondary STEM teachers to effectively teach high-need students, including students from low socio-economic circumstances, from under-represented populations in STEM, from rural or remote schools, and English language learners. Strategic EWU project activities designed to develop skills and dispositions necessary to effectively teach high-need students mathematics and science include: online learning modules and field work designed by faculty specializing in Ethnic Studies and English as a Second Language (ESL); participation in three six-week rotations in classrooms of exceptional STEM teachers with high-need students; design and implementation of Inquiry Circles (after-school middle and high school students STEM events) in order to practice designing, implementing, and reflecting on activities for high-need students; participation with graduates in their first two years of teaching in a Video Club to explore the challenges of implementing effective inquiry learning; and research on an important aspect of teaching in their discipline and presentation of their studies at the EWU Student Research and Creative Works Symposium. After certification and obtaining a teaching position, Scholars will remain active in the EWU Noyce Program by participating in the Video Club three times per year and through regular contact with EWU faculty. The project will benefit from the collaboration and support of the Noyce Advisory Board and Noyce Collaborators. These groups will monitor and advise project leaders, ensure that the project is integrated into the culture at EWU, monitor recruitment and Scholar progress, and provide advice to resolve issues that arise. Ultimately, the EWU research-based project design provides activities within a learning progression that enables Scholars to develop into impactful and reflective STEM teachers."

The objective of the project is to train students to think and act like scientists - to propose hypotheses, to design experiments, to analyze data, to draw conclusions, and to communicate with other scientists.  Students on six campuses (Rochester Institute of Technology, Hope College, California Polytechnic Institute, Ursinus College, St. Mary's University, and SUNY Oswego) will engage in computational and wet lab approaches to predict protein function.  In a previous project, the team of principal investigators created a series of modules to guide student inquiry and video instructions for the computational techniques, which were deployed in biochemistry teaching laboratories across the six campuses.  In the present project, the faculty team will classify and characterize the research behaviors that students display during the course and will develop and validate methods for understanding students' development as scientists.  Because the students are participating in authentic research, results from their experiments will also be collated into a database that can be used by future students to pursue biologically relevant protein functions, such as the potential discovery of drug targets for diseases.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of the project is to introduce cutting-edge biochemistry research into the classroom to investigate whether getting students to participate in hypothesis-driven experimental science is a useful tool in educating students to become scientists.   In this second phase of a course-based undergraduate research experience, students' learning and growth as scientists will be assessed by local biochemistry faculty and evaluated by educational researchers at Purdue University, to ascertain students' understanding of research methods, visualization, biological context, and mechanisms of protein function. The faculty team will develop validated assessment tools to measure these objectives, and will balance the homogeneity of curricular materials needed to ensure sound education with the flexibility needed for adaptation in different institutional settings. The course instructors and project evaluators will collaborate using education research techniques to monitor both students' development of research behaviors and changes in instructors' teaching approaches.  The refined and tested curriculum will then be ready for wider dissemination into the biochemistry teaching community.  The need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education and for the inclusion of a more diverse population is widely recognized.  The project team includes faculty from a Hispanic-serving institution and from an institution with a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students; inclusion of these faculty ensures that the needs and concerns of these communities will be included in the project."

One type of material (an inorganic class of compounds called perovskites) consists of extremely small spherical particles (called quantum dots), where the size of the particle determines how it absorbs and emits light. The other material is a very thin plate, which can be viewed as a structure with only two dimensions (called nanoplatelets), made from various semiconductor compounds. The flow of energy in these materials, in discrete amounts (excitons) can be followed and controlled. These new materials have potential applications in solar energy conversion and nanoscale lasers. Developing efficient and cost-effective solar energy conversion materials is one of the most important scientific challenges of the 21st century. The proposed work will lead to a fundamental understanding of the properties of these materials, facilitating their further development and many potential applications.<br/><br/>Bulk perovskite materials have achieved impressive performance in multiple applications, including highly efficient solar cells (with certified power conversion efficiencies of > 20%) and low threshold lasing. Colloidal perovskite quantum dots offer the possibility to further tune, improve and optimize the properties of these materials through the quantum confinement effect. Colloidal two-dimensional cadmium chalcogenide nanoplatelets, are an emerging novel class of semiconductor quantum well materials with atomically precise thickness. The uniform energy over lateral dimensions of 10s to 100 nm in nanoplateletes suggests the possibility of novel exciton properties, such as the giant oscillator strength transitions effect. These unique properties, differing significantly from zero-dimensional quantum dots and one-dimenisonal nanorods, suggest many novel applications in optoelectronic devices and in solar energy conversion. The proposed studies are aimed at a fundamental understanding of exciton and charge carrier dynamics in these novel materials, which is essential to their development, rational design and improvement. The specific aims of the research plan are: 1) To study how the electron and hole transfer rates from perovskite QDs to molecular acceptors depend on the QD size and anion identity, testing theoretical models for charge transfer from QDs; 2) To examine how the interfacial electron transfer rates from perovskite QDs to oxide nanocrystalline thin films depend on the QD (size and anion) and oxide (TiO2, SnO2 and ZnO), testing current theoretical models of interfacial ET at QD/oxide interfaces; 3) To measure 2D exciton Bohr's radius and exciton center of mass coherent delocalization length of CdX(X=S, Se, Te) NPLs as a function of layer thickness, materials, solvent dielectric constant and temperature, testing the applicability of 2D hydrogenic model for describing excitons in NPLs and the extent of the giant oscillator strength transition effect; 4) To directly image the spatial distribution of excitons in CdSe core-only, type I CdSe/CdS core/crown and type II CdTe/CdSe core/crown NPLs using electron acceptor (TiO2) modified AFM tips, examining how band alignment in NPL heterostructures affect exciton spatial distribution. In addition to the training of graduate students and undergraduate students, the proposed work will lead to the development of new course materials on clean energy at the undergraduate level and broadened participation of under-represented minority students."

In an educational context, reflection plays a critical role in professional practice, learning from experience, and successful implementation of teaching methods such as active learning. In supporting student learning, educators can potentially improve and transform student learning through reflection activities. Reflection activities can be modest in terms of the amount of time required and thus can be added to existing instructional efforts to help magnify the impact of many types of educational activities and help individuals go beyond simply doing better. Reflection activities may be a significant tool in efforts to critically improve engineering education, address issues such as diversity and retention, and support learning goals such as innovation and global competencies. Yet, within engineering education, reflection and reflection activities are understudied. The proposed work will establish and refine instruments that will help educators and scholars better understand student engagement in reflection activities, specifically their reactions to engaging in reflection activities and their self-reported knowledge gains. These instruments will be critical for helping engineering educators bring reflection activities into their teaching through informed choices and creating opportunities for deeper and more nuanced scholarship on reflection activities. <br/><br/>The intent of this study is to explore undergraduate engineering students' knowledge gains using a common approach so that reflection activities can be compared more readily. Another intent is to better understand student reactions to the reflection activities in a way that may serve many purposes such as interpreting study results and identifying ways to refine activities. A multi-week study with undergraduate engineering students culminating in interviews will capture students' perspectives when talking about reflection. These perspectives will be used to refine the conceptual models related to knowledge from and reactions to engaging in reflection activities. Usability studies of survey items and a principal component analysis will also be used to systematically develop and validate survey instruments. Finally, a study focusing on a selected reflection activity (e.g. exam wrappers) will be used for further survey validation. The proposed work features a systematic, rigorous process using best practices in survey instrument development, and in supporting educators in operationalizing learning goals through reflection activities. To this latter end, our proposed work includes both scholarly and practical dissemination."

The main insight from this theory is that a compressible signal can be acquired with much less effort than a signal with a high information content. However, these results are commonly based on mathematical models for signals that are already digitized and for sensors that measure randomly, which makes them somewhat disconnected from realistic physical signals and apparatuses. This work explores recent trends in narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Instead of digital signals, models for analog signals are used to define compressibility. The signal space includes the possibility of continuous changes without producing artifacts in the signal recovery procedure. This idea will be applied to radar, X-ray crystallography, and other sensing systems. The work is also anticipated to have application to neural networks that form the basis for modern machine learning algorithms. Although the application to machine learning is entirely concerned with digital data, the use of continuous models ensures that encoded information can be retrieved accurately. <br/><br/>Redundant, stable expansions with frames have become central to many applications of mathematics in data science, signal acquisition, and communications, from remote sensing to packet-based, wireless, fiber optical, or quantum communications and recently in compressed sensing and super-resolution. Despite the successes of the frame-based expansion and acquisition of signals, there is often a mismatch between the stylized mathematical signal and measurement models that are assumed and the corresponding physical models in the analog domain. For example, signal acquisition is typically described by specific linear functionals, not randomly chosen, unstructured ones. This research project addresses the need to improve compatibility between continuous and discrete representation spaces on a fundamental level. A typical model for analog signals is given by infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with a reproducing kernel and an associated expansion with respect to a continuous, highly coherent family of vectors. A natural measure of sparsity of a signal is in this setting the minimal number of kernel functions needed in its expansion. Signal acquisition is usually based on sampling from a group-invariant, discrete family of functionals. The expected outcomes of the project include: (1) accurate recovery for signals that are sparsely synthesized in a finite- or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel space and measured with physically relevant sensing models, using a sparsity-inducing norm that is stable with respect to continuous deformations; (2) phase retrieval, signal recovery based on magnitudes of frame coefficients, in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces such as multivariate Paley-Wiener spaces, which will be done using sparsity to demonstrate injectivity of measurements, stability, and feasibility of recovery algorithms in a general class of kernel spaces; and (3) a version of Mallat's scattering transform in a redundant representation with approximate invertibility based on phase retrieval and sparsity. The scattering transform extracts nonlinear features from data that are powerful descriptors in classification problems. It is designed from a viewpoint of desirable properties in the analog domain, but its application is mostly to digitized data of limited size, for which the claims need to be properly adapted. The investigators will use phase retrieval and sparsity to demonstrate the approximate invertibility of the transform, which is needed to verify the faithful encoding of data."

The long-term goal of the project is that virtual assistants will improve productivity for software engineers.<br/><br/>This proposal targets two of those barriers: 1) conversation analysis and modeling, and 2) reference expression generation.  The first of these problems, in a nutshell, is that experiments in natural language modeling conversations tend to cover topics with similar outcomes, while conversations about software may have a much wider range of possible outcomes.  The second problem is that much research in natural language processing is focused on how humans refer to physical objects that have attributes that are universally preferred while in contrast, software artifacts tend not to have measurable attributes that people use as descriptions.  The chief broader impact is an application to assistive technology for persons who are visually impaired.

This project aims at translating the powerful techniques used in spectroscopy to a novel type of sensors, based on the quantum properties of defects in diamond. <br/>These optically active defects (color centers) have an associated electronic spin that is sensitive to magnetic and electric fields, temperature, pressure, etc. The project will develop spectroscopic techniques, tailored to the quantum realm, that can be implemented with these nanoscale sensors in diamond. In particular, the project will focus on achieving noise spectroscopy, that is, measuring spatial and temporal correlation of random fields (in particular magnetic fields), which are ubiquitous in materials and biological sciences. By combining novel noise spectroscopic techniques that work for quantum sensors, with the nanoscale resolution of the quantum sensors themselves, the novel quantum noise spectroscopy technique will be able to measure fields at scales not previously accessible. <br/>In addition, the project will provide opportunities for training graduate and undergraduate students in broad areas, ranging from magnetic resonance, to quantum information, as well as experimental skills in electronics and quantum optics. The project will in addition develop outreach activities, including a diamond sensor demo. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Description: The advent of novel nanoscale sensors exploiting individual quantum systems promise to shed light into our fundamental understanding of nano-electronics, photonics and magnetics devices, and their underlying physical phenomena. These novel quantum probes, such as the Nitrogen-Vacancy center in diamond, can perform in conditions and with a spatial resolution previously inaccessible: they can be brought very close to the system of interest and measure minute magnetic (or electric) fields with nanoscale resolution. <br/>After the first proof-of-principle demonstrations in recent years, these sensors are on the verge of becoming transformative tools for the exploration of electromagnetic devices and materials.  To reach this goal, these spin sensors should be able not only to measure the magnitude of a given field, but more importantly its temporal and spatial correlations that carry most of the information about underlying physical properties. The goal of this project is to transform quantum sensors associated with spins in diamond into powerful spectrometers, able to detect spatiotemporal correlations of magnetic fields at the nanoscale due to, e.g., biological or magnetic materials dynamics, with a spatial resolution and sensitivity previously unattainable. Moreover, characterizing the noise spectrum is critical for devising effective strategies to counteract decoherence in emerging quantum devices. <br/>This project will combine expertise on noise spectroscopy and on quantum digital filtering to achieve an efficient and complete reconstruction of the noise spectrum via a quantum nanoscale sensor. The ultimate goal is to develop a new field of quantum digital noise spectroscopy, based on noise spectroscopy combined with the complete basis of Walsh digital filtering functions, and applying it to enhanced sensing of magnetic samples, and their structure and spatiotemporal correlations. Quantum digital noise spectroscopy with NV centers in diamond, also combined with super-resolution addressing of NVs, will be applied to nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging of biological samples and to measure spatial noise correlations of magnetic 2D materials. Such experiments could shed new light on the structure and dynamics of the measured samples, leading to new insights in biological functions and in universal properties of magnetic phase transitions."

The physics associated with signal propagation and sensing in these problems creates substantial computational challenges for transforming raw data into useful information. The research team in this project aims to develop computational methods that greatly reduce the cost of real time imaging by providing improvements in statistical inverse theory, numerical inversion methods, simulation models, and hybrid imaging models.  The main thrusts of the project will be tested on imaging applications in medical tomography, environmental remediation, and airport security imaging. The techniques form the basis for addressing analogous problems associated with inversion of optical signals across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. As part of the project, a modular course will be developed to teach these new methods at the graduate level. The course materials will be made available over the internet.<br/><br/>The large-scale imaging, or inverse, problems addressed by this collaborative team require the minimization of a parameter-dependent function that expresses the misfit of predicted measurements for a candidate image and actual measurement data. The potentially large number of parameters must be minimized over an ever-increasing huge number of measurements, while concurrently some unknown set of the data may be redundant.  Detailed images, however, are not always needed for addressing relevant, practical questions and decision making. A combination of computational techniques will be developed to make large-scale parameter-dependent minimization computationally feasible.  Furthermore, novel efficient approaches for inferring critical image features will be developed, obviating need for complete reconstruction of an image. The research builds on recent methods that exploit randomization to compute accurate estimates of solutions at greatly reduced computational cost, and on the efficient construction of smaller, approximate, reduced order numerical models that are accurate for relevant sets of parameters, and thus reduce the cost of full simulation of the sensing physics. Probabilistic approaches for inference of critical image features that guide image interpretation and decision making will be developed. The mathematics associated with this approach requires these methods to capitalize on other new tools also under development in this project."

In particular, wearable biological sensors built on a mechanically flexible substrate hold great promise to enable minimally invasive, point-of-care human health monitoring. This especially applies to those who need constant care, including bedridden and neonatal patients. However, current wearable sensors only allow for measuring a handful of physical parameters, thus lacking versatility, specificity, and often sensitivity offered by conventional biochemical techniques operated in a laboratory setting. This research aims to develop a nanotechnology-based wearable biological sensor device platform that can be attached onto the curved surface of a mouth guard and enables continuous monitoring the concentration levels of inflammatory immune disorder biomarker proteins in saliva at high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This sensor platform could be eventually translated to wide clinical use to tailor the immune therapy blocking inflammation-causing agents in the body. Eliminating the long measurement lead-time and labor intensiveness that conventional clinical tests suffer from, the technology coming out of this research has the potential to provide the means to precisely monitor the immune status of an individual person, which meets the urgent need for 'Precision (or Personalized) Medicine' curing systemic immune disorders. In this program, the principal investigators (PIs) will collaborate with the Ecotek lab's Young Xplorer program in order to offer after-school hands-on research experiences in sensor nanofabrication to K-12 students. This program will allow the PIs to participate in conferences organized by Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) societies, such as Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), Advancing Hispanics, Chicanos, and Native Americans in Science (SANCAS) Society, and Society of Women Engineers (SWE), to stimulate the interests of underrepresented minority students in nanotechnology-based biological sensor devices and solicit their participation in the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) hosted by the PIs.  <br/><br/>Cytokines are key biomolecules acting as mediators and modulators of the complex functional interactions and responses of the immune system. Quantifying cytokines allows immune responses to be monitored, providing clinically and immunologically useful information related to infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, allergy transplantation, and drug discovery. The goal of this research is to establish an integrated device technology that enables continuous monitoring of the immune status by using a wearable label-free cytokine biological sensor. With the proposed study completed, this research will establish nanoscale device fabrication techniques required for strategically integrating structurally uniform, high-density nanoplasmonic biological sensor arrays and an atomically thin semiconducting photodetector device layer onto a mechanically flexible common microsystem platform. It will also provide fundamental device physics knowledge critically important to maximize sensor integrability, sensitivity, response speed, analyte detectability, biological/photo signal transduction efficiency, and versatility of the device under mechanical deformations on a curved surface.  The unique biosensing scheme used for the fully flexible device employs (1) biologically tuned nanoplasmonic light absorbance resonance shifts and (2) high-responsivity, high-quantum-efficiency photoelectronic conversion by two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) structures.  As a result, the proposed device is expected to enable label-free, continuous, concurrent, minimally-invasive detection of 4 key salivary cytokine biomarkers at unprecedented levels of detectability (limit-of-detection (LOD) < 1 pg/mL ~ 50fM) and response speed (< 10 min) in point-of-care settings. This sensor response speed is equivalent to a total assay time more than 20-100 times shorter than that of the conventional gold standard clinical test. This research holds great promise to develop the first wearable photoelectronic biological sensor technology based on the analyte-receptor binding immunoassay mechanism, which is broadly applicable to detection of a wide variety of protein disease markers."

The research in this project focuses on studying physical mechanisms that allow for spintronics in carbon-based, so-called organic semiconductors.

This underrepresentation of such a large portion of the US population in STEM graduate programs must be addressed, and supporting URM students in their pursuit of advanced degrees is a critical piece. Working in pursuit of this critical piece, the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), a part of the University of California Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program, will offer 12 incoming LSAMP PhD students substantial fellowships and degree completion support. LSAMP assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP BD Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to ""integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.""  For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  UCSB is uniquely positioned in this alliance as it has also recently become a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), and as such is the first in the Association of American Universities (AAU) to reach HSI status, putting UCSB on a short list of prominent research-intensive institutions serving a large number of Hispanic students. The BD project at UCSB seeks to seed a shift in the institutional culture by introducing holistic selection criteria and faculty mentoring resources, and raising the visibility of motivated and talented URM STEM PhD trainees and alumni thereby encouraging future generations of underrepresented students. Similarly, the proposed UCSB-BD program intends to increase the number of URM students in STEM who successfully complete a doctoral program at UCSB and successfully transition into the STEM workforce with the highest level of academic achievement. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/>There remains a growing demand in the United States for a highly trained and diverse STEM workforce to maintain US intellectual and economic competitiveness in the global market. However, while the US moves toward minority-majority status, that demographic change is not reflected in the number of graduate degrees being awarded to underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. In fact, in 2014, URMs represented only 13% of the earned doctorates in science and engineering. Having a diverse set of problem-solvers becomes paramount to sustaining the nation's scientific excellence and solving important societal needs. The current underrepresentation of such a large portion of the US population in STEM graduate programs must be addressed. Supporting URM students in their pursuit of advanced degrees is crucial. UCSB will support 12 PhD students through the BD program within the University of California LSAMP.  The UCSB-BD program seeks to increase the diversity and inclusion of our STEM workforce through a concerted campus-wide effort and an evidence-based program designed to identify and foster the development of a cohort of alumni as PhD-trained science and engineering leaders. <br/><br/>The UCSB-BD program will build on existing infrastructure, develop new strategies and leverage networks, campus, state, and nation-wide, to expand the body of knowledge around recruiting, training and retaining a diverse population of PhD-trained scientists and engineers. The BD program at UCSB will do this by providing a strong community of mentors and an extensive academic and professional preparation program that offers BD Fellows access to the tools and community interaction that will foster success in their graduate programs and beyond. With a focus on affirming values, nurturing a sense of belonging, and mentoring through key transition points, the UCSB-BD program will ensure a timely completion of the PhD and a confident transition into STEM careers in academia, government and industry. As UCSB strives to promote a nurturing environment for our STEM PhD trainees, hosting a BD program is an important step toward building more robust and inclusive recruitment and retention strategies for broadening participation. Additionally, in order to better understand the important factors in the trajectory of success for those underrepresented in science and engineering seeking and progressing though advanced degrees, a rigorous evaluation plan and tracking strategy will be employed and results shared across the California LSAMP alliance and national networks."

While a lot of signal estimation tasks are naturally formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, existing results for nonconvex methods have several fundamental limitations, and the current state of the art is still limited in terms of when, why and which nonconvex approaches are effective for a given problem. The goal of this research program is to significantly deepen and broaden the understanding and applications of nonconvex optimization for high-dimensional signal estimation.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will study high-dimensional signal estimation via direct optimization of nonconvex, and potentially nonsmooth, loss functions, without resorting to convex relaxation.

These results will then be exploited as guidelines to develop fast and provably correct algorithms for estimating high-dimensional signals with physically induced structures and under streaming data observations. Specifically, the research program consists of three major thrusts: (1) understanding the geometric structures of important classes of nonconvex loss surfaces, and characterizing their impact on the convergence of optimization algorithms; (2) developing fast algorithms and the associated theory for the recovery of structured low-rank matrices; (3) designing new online algorithms that are time and space efficient under a streaming setting, with the capability of detecting and tracking the time-varying signals of interest."

This project's research is designed to address current limitations of tensor analysis by developing new theory and algorithms and high-performance scalable parallel formulations of the various computational kernels used by these algorithms, and a flexible open source software toolkit that can be used to perform constrained and hidden tensor factorization of very large and sparse multi-way datasets. The success of this project will allow researchers to leverage the power of multi-way ``Big Data'' analysis to solve various problems in diverse application domains such as healthcare, medical imaging, cybersecurity, social and behavioral sciences, and e-commerce. At the same time, the project will provide data science training to the students involved by combining cutting-edge data and signal analytics, data mining, and high-performance computing.<br/><br/>Constrained matrix and tensor factorization techniques are widely used for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and estimation in machine learning, signal processing, and many other walks of science and engineering. Unconstrained matrix and tensor factorization algorithms are relatively mature, but constrained counterparts are lagging in terms of speed, scalability, and flexibility. In many applications (e.g., medical imaging and recommender systems), instead of observing the actual entries of a tensor, we observe a limited number of linear combinations (e.g., partial sums) of these entries and need to identify the tensor's latent factors from these measurements. Being able to directly identify the latent factors from linear measurements, which we refer to as hidden tensor factorization, has important advantages in terms of complexity, memory footprint, and the ability to handle very large data sets. Developing open source high-performance parallel tools for constrained and hidden tensor factorization in both shared- and distributed-memory systems will significantly enhance the ability to analyze very large multi-way data. The research will evolve along two synergistic thrusts. First, it will develop new theory and algorithms for constrained and hidden tensor factorization by (i) building fast first-order (FFO) and fast stochastic first-order (FSFO) constrained tensor decomposition algorithms that strike favorable trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, and speed of convergence, and (ii) tackling important identifiability and algorithmic issues related to hidden tensor factorization. Second, it will undertake a multi-pronged effort towards developing high-performance parallel formulations for the computational kernels used in constrained and unconstrained tensor and hidden tensor factorization and develop a high-performance tensor factorization software toolbox. The release of the high-performance tensor factorization toolbox will enable researchers and practitioners to scale up not only the size of data but also the variety of constraints and types of data they can analyze. The research will involve students that will be trained in data science, combining cutting-edge signal and data analytics, data mining, and high-performance computing."

These resources will support parents' engagement in science activities with their children both in the adult education settings as well as at home.  Adult and family educators will receive professional development resources and training to support their integration of the parent/child activities. Project partners include the National Center for Families Learning, Kentucky Educational Television, and Alabama Public Television,<br/><br/>The goals of the Ruff Family Science project are to: (1) investigate adult education settings that feature an intergenerational learning model, in order to learn about the unique characteristics of adults and families who are enrolled in these programs; (2) examine the institutional circumstances and educator practices that support joint parent/child engagement in science; (3) iteratively develop new prototype resources meet the priorities and needs of families and educators involved in intergenerational education settings; and (4) develop the knowledge needed to create a fuller set of materials in the future that will motivate and support diverse, low-income parents to investigate science with their children.  The research strategy is comprised of three main components: Phase 1: Needs Assessment: Determine key motivations and behaviors common to adult education students who are also parents; surface obstacles and assets inherent in these parents' current practices; and examine the needs and available resources for supplementing parents' current engagement in family science learning. Phase 2: Prototype Development: Iteratively develop two prototype Activity Sets, along with related educator supports and training materials, designed to promote joint parent-child engagement with English and Spanish-speaking families around physical science concepts. Phase 3: Prototype Field Test: Test how the two refined prototype Activity Sets work in different educational settings (adult education, parent education, and parent and child together time).

Magnetic memories have the advantages: they retain information even with the electrical power turned off and they never wear out. At the same time they can be made very dense, fast, and inexpensive.  The remaining challenge standing in the way of widespread application of magnetic memories is to reduce the electrical energy required to write their information. This project is investigating physics questions related to solving this challenge.  The research team is focusing on promising new physical effects that emerge when a thin layer of magnetic material is coupled to a second material containing heavy atoms such as tungsten or tantalum so that it possesses what is known as strong spin-orbit interactions.  The team is studying materials and device geometries that enable these spin-orbit interactions to drive magnetic switching with record-low values of applied energy.  They are also investigating related effects of how interaction with a magnetic layer can affect the electrical properties of the material with strong spin-orbit interactions.

The research team is examining both the effects of the spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic layer, and the effect of magnetic interactions on electrons inside the material with strong spin-orbit coupling. This research builds, in part, on recent discoveries by the principal investigator and collaborators concerning current-generated ""spin-orbit torques"" that can be used to manipulate very efficiently the magnetization direction of magnetic memory devices, and it seeks to answer several of the most important unresolved questions in this field: (1) Is there a practical way to use broken symmetries to reorient spin-orbit torques into the direction most desired for applications? (2) Can the scattering of spin-polarized electrons from an interface with strong spin-orbit coupling generate spin-orbit torques via mechanisms that are not yet understood? (3) Can the large spin and orbital moments present in some f-electron elements be used to enhance spin-orbit torques?   The project is also exploring other new scientific opportunities enabled by interfacial interactions between magnetism with spin-orbit materials, to better control both the properties of the magnetic film (e.g., magnetic damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, magnetic anisotropy) and the spin and valley dynamics of electrons within the spin-orbit material (e.g., magnetic control of optical properties, valley Hall effect, valley ferromagnetism, and superconductivity)."

As students work in makerspaces they traverse and integrate a wide variety of skills that create a dynamic relationship between the learning processes, creative exploration, and expertise acquisition. This work provides an initial examination of this interplay between learning and expertise. It begins to answer the question of what and how students learn in university makerspaces. At present, it is unclear what university students actually learn in university makerspaces and how this compares with other hands-on learning opportunities such as competition team projects, undergraduate research, or similar experiences. Educators hope makerspaces are effective learning environments that can 1) enhance lifelong and self-directed learning skills, 2) expand engineering curricula, and 3) motivate while simultaneously educating the next generation of STEM students. However, there are few studies on the development of expertise and learning or their impact on creativity in makerspaces because these spaces are complex, dynamic, non-standard environments that provoke unprecedented challenges when it comes to their study. In addition, most work on expertise and creativity compares novices and experts but fails to create detailed accounts of how one moves from novice to expert nor how this transition influences the ability to be creative within the domain. Most studies of expertise are comparison studies or simply snapshot of groups at certain points in time. These studies overlook the development of expertise. In makerspaces, students are often motivated by an idea to make a creative project, and in turn they thereby develop expertise and undergo learning. This learning that takes place in makerspaces is natural, organic, and uncontrolled. This study of makerspaces will examine these phenomena as they naturally occur, rather than altering the environment to conform to a typical controlled experiment. This approach enables the study of the evolution of making as engineering makers mature and evolve on two different campuses.<br/><br/>This study will focus on two very different makerspaces at two different universities. Both spaces feature many of the commonly found making equipment (e.g., 3D printers, electronics equipment, wood and metal working equipment, etc.), but each has its own unique culture and placement into the programs at their respective universities.  Further, the differences between the universities create a unique opportunity for comparison.  To study the makerspaces at these two universities, the following methodological procedures will be used: 1) ethnographic observation in making activities, and 2) observations and interviews with student groups and individual students who are making in the engineering makerspaces. This work is also envisioned as a springboard for future studies in understanding makerspaces including makerspace culture, barriers and pathways to entry, tensions produced in the space, student design processes, innovative approaches, and collaborative efforts."

While a lot of signal estimation tasks are naturally formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, existing results for nonconvex methods have several fundamental limitations, and the current state of the art is still limited in terms of when, why and which nonconvex approaches are effective for a given problem. The goal of this research program is to significantly deepen and broaden the understanding and applications of nonconvex optimization for high-dimensional signal estimation.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will study high-dimensional signal estimation via direct optimization of nonconvex, and potentially nonsmooth, loss functions, without resorting to convex relaxation.

These results will then be exploited as guidelines to develop fast and provably correct algorithms for estimating high-dimensional signals with physically induced structures and under streaming data observations. Specifically, the research program consists of three major thrusts: (1) understanding the geometric structures of important classes of nonconvex loss surfaces, and characterizing their impact on the convergence of optimization algorithms; (2) developing fast algorithms and the associated theory for the recovery of structured low-rank matrices; (3) designing new online algorithms that are time and space efficient under a streaming setting, with the capability of detecting and tracking the time-varying signals of interest."

A theme central to the project is deepening our understanding of 4-dimensional aspects of ""knotting,"" an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which strings become tangled and knotted in space. In addition to a fundamental role that knot theory plays in topology, its has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science and biology. One of the primary aims of the project is to understand both how knots evolve over time and the surfaces that they bound in 4-dimensional space. Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time. Further, imagine that at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together. Such a movie is called a ""cobordism,"" and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way. Understanding this arithmetic turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of mathematics.  Primary goals in this vein include understanding knotted curves whose cobordisms arise from complex polynomials and probing the aforementioned algebraic structures using tools inspired by mathematical physics.   In addition to its mathematical goals, the project will contribute to the organization of conferences and workshops, and provide critical support for students.<br/><br/>Knot theory and its 4-dimensional aspects play a fundamental role throughout the project and can be viewed as its primary focus.  Specific goals include determining the faithfulness of geometric maps between concordance and cobordism groups, topological characterizations of knots that bound complex curves in Stein domains, and the development of algebraic tools to facilitate computations of subtle invariant of knots, tangles, and 3-manifolds defined by way of Lagrangian Floer homology and non-abelian gauge theory.  The project crosses boundaries between topology, analysis, algebra, and combinatorics, and uses techniques from homological algebra, gauge theory, knot theory, contact geometry, and the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds."

This project will research effective solutions to overcome these challenges so as to facilitate the design of the next generation of high-performance integrated circuits. In addition to research, the project has an educational component that includes the development of instructional material for the undergraduate and graduate curriculum on reliability in mixed-signal circuits, and in training future scientists/engineers to learn creative problem solving skills.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the use of multigate transistor technologies in the design of mixed-signal integrated circuits with both digital and analog parts, using the case of input/output (I/O) circuits as a testbed for evaluating a set of proposed approaches that proactively model and mitigate circuit aging in transistors and interconnect wires. Specific aging mechanisms that will be investigated include bias temperature instability, hot carrier injection, gate oxide breakdown, and electromigration. These effects are accentuated by the increased thermal effects and thermal nonuniformities seen in multigate transistor technologies, and it is important to develop methods that tightly integrate reliability computations with thermal analysis. The work will link the impact of such effects at the transistor level to the mixed-signal block level, and then up to the system level. The proposed techniques will act in conjunction with on-chip compensation techniques that make circuits more robust to aging-induced performance drifts."

Such computations can be expensive because of the unsteady structures in the turbulence. This project will focus on developing simulation techniques to make such computations more practical. Outreach activities through ASU community-connect infrastructure will focus on educating high-school students about turbulence and its connection to real-life applications through short tutorials and demonstrations involving advanced visualization of turbulent flows and large-scale organized motions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop the strategies that mitigate the problem associated with the persistence of slow moving coherent structures in certain portions of the flow domain, or locking, during the finite time of numerical simulations. In these situations, the collected flow statistics can be significantly biased by the localized and temporary effect of these structures and cannot reliably represent a long-term system dynamics. The current proposal is devoted to designing simple but efficient strategies that will yield significantly improved convergence of statistics in numerical simulations over a much reduced computational time. These strategies include efficient sampling over multiple realizations and multiple states of the flow during the finite time of the simulations. This will be achieved by designing specific mathematical transformations of the computed flow field at a runtime that can be thought of as disturbances that trigger the state transitions in nature. The symmetries of the system will be explored to design the transformations that (i) amenable to promoting quick transitions into desired unsampled flow states, (ii) mathematically consistent and preserve the governing fluid dynamics equations.  In addition to improving statistical convergence, the project seeks to answer the following scientific questions: (i) whether the observation of very long-lived asymmetric flow states in certain symmetric systems, such as jets in crossflow and bluff-body wakes, is an artifact of a similar phenomenon of coherent structure locking and whether the current techniques will yield symmetric average fields, (ii) whether addition of the samples from the newly reconstructed states improve a long-term prediction of the system dynamics by low-order models, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. The research is coupled to the educational plan that includes outreach activities at local Phoenix district high schools, involvement of undergraduates in research, and improving graduate curriculum."

This geometry comes from projecting points in a higher dimensional space along lines to a lower dimensional projective space. Unlike Euclidean geometry, this geometry has no well-defined notions of distance or angle. Its only meaningful geometric notion is incidence (for example, intersections of lines and inclusion of points in lines). In principle, this inability to measure distance initially seems like a drawback; however, in practice it provides a unified framework for studying seemingly disparate and incongruous geometries simultaneously. For example, projective space has pieces that serve as models for the familiar Euclidean geometry, the non-Euclidean spherical and hyperbolic geometries, and other exotic geometries, such as de Sitter and anti de Sitter space, that are of interest in modern physics. Recently, there has been increased interest in properly convex domains, which are interesting pieces of projective space that share many properties with hyperbolic space but enjoy interesting deformation properties absent in the hyperbolic setting. A primary focus of this project is to produce more of these properly convex examples and to understand their geometric, dynamic, and algebraic properties in a systematic fashion.  Due to built-in connections with perspective and computer vision, many of the low dimensional examples under study in this project can be effectively visualized and rendered with the aid of a computer to produce vibrant dynamic graphics. This feature will allow the involvement of students with limited mathematical background in portions of the research as well as conveying the spirit of many of the important results to the broader non-mathematical community. <br/><br/>Properly convex domains are subsets of projective space that are disjoint from a projective hyperplane and convex in the affine space produced by removing such a hyperplane from projective space. Hyperbolic space serves as the prime example of a properly convex domain via the Klein model. Properly convex domains and their quotients by discrete groups share many properties with hyperbolic space and hyperbolic orbifolds. A main point of this proposal is to understand how familiar concepts in hyperbolic geometry manifest themselves in properly convex geometry. Three main aims of the project are 1) developing a properly convex theory of Dehn surgery that can be used to produce examples of closed properly convex manifolds from non-compact ones, 2) investigating how dynamic properties of the fundamental group of a projective manifold manifest themselves geometrically, in analogy with geometric finiteness for hyperbolic manifolds, and 3) using properly convex structures to produce subgroups of the special linear group with interesting algebraic properties (such as thinness). In addition to the obvious potential to better understand geometric and dynamical aspects of properly convex manifolds, this project should also yield a deeper understanding of hyperbolic geometry by elucidating which geometric features of hyperbolic geometry are consequences of uniform negative curvature and which are consequences of more general geometric structure."

RELAMPAGO will be a 45-day project from 1 November - 15 December 2018.  RELAMPAGO examines what are perhaps the ""world's most intense thunderstorms"" per satellite observations, studying the processes that generate intense convection and severe weather that accompanies them, including heavy precipitation, severe hail and winds, and tornadoes.  By observing storms with new tools and techniques in detail in a region that has some similarities and key differences with the US Great Plains, RELAMPAGO is designed to make contributions to improve prediction of severe convective storms globally, including in the US. In addition, RELAMPAGO's international coordination is integrated to directly improve high impact weather prediction in Latin America. <br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration between researchers at the University of Illinois and Colorado State University to study the processes that generate intense convection and precipitation in this region.  The project includes a network of research-quality fixed and mobile radars, atmospheric soundings, and storm process measurements in concert with other RELAMPAGO measurements (including from the DOE ARM Mobile Facility-1) to characterize the environment and internal structure of heavy-rain-producing storms. These measurements, value-added products, analyses, and modeling activities are focused on understanding the precursors and processes within and external to the storms to address hypotheses on relevant to heavy rainfall production in Argentinean convective storms in this poorly observed, yet vulnerable region.

These storms initiate at the foothills of the Andes Mountains as well as the Sierras de Crdoba (SDC) and produce extreme lightning amounts, large hail, tornadoes and heavy rainfall. The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of characteristics and causes of lightning in this understudied region of uniquely intense storms and differences in electrification between these storms and other convective storms in different environments that lead to such high impact weather.<br/> <br/>Towards these goals, researchers at the University of Colorado (CU) and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) will study atmospheric conditions and physical processes that control storm electrification and lead to extreme lightning flash rates in conjunction with other high impact weather. Measurements of these severe storms will be taken during the planned RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign to be able to address these goals. Such storms have a large economic impact as they pose a hazard to people, property, agriculture and infrastructure. An improved understanding of conditions and processes from the studied storms will lead to better nowcasting and forecasting of severe weather. Furthermore, this project will support educational training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. They will participate in the scientific research through independent studies and participation in the RELAMPAGO field campaign and have the opportunity to collaborate with the US and international researchers from a multitude of disciplines.<br/><br/>Some fundamental relationships between meteorology and electrification are not completely understood, including a lack of knowledge of how microphysical and kinematic processes control the development of charge regions inside deep convective storms. Recent studies in the US suggest that regional differences between microphysical, dynamical and electrical behavior exist. Thus, more research in different regions of the world such as in Argentina is needed to understand the physical connections between storm processes, electrification and lightning characteristics. The team of researchers from CU and UAH will investigate the environmental conditions and physical processes that control storm electrification and lead to extreme lightning flash rates of severe storms in west-central Argentina. The goal of the research is to advance understanding of storms producing extreme flash rates and of differences in electrification among convective storm types and environments that lead to high impact weather. This includes determining what role various storm environmental, kinematic and microphysical processes play in governing charge, charge region development and resultant flash rates and other properties (e.g., type, size, polarity, current, charge neutralized) in these extremely severe storms.

The CU/UAH team will use measurements from radars and atmospheric soundings deployed during RELAMPAGO to obtain thermodynamic, kinematic, and microphysical measurements.

RELAMPAGO will be a 45-day project from 1 November - 15 December 2018.  RELAMPAGO examines what are perhaps the ""world's most intense thunderstorms"" per satellite observations, studying the processes that generate intense convection and severe weather that accompanies them, including heavy precipitation, severe hail and winds, and tornadoes.  By observing storms with new tools and techniques in detail in a region that has some similarities and key differences with the US Great Plains, RELAMPAGO is designed to make contributions to improve prediction of severe convective storms globally, including in the US.

Researchers need an IoT research infrastructure that allows them to address the challenges associated with the IoT. IoTE^3 (IoT Event Emulation Environment) is a new research infrastructure proposed for this purpose. It will leverage an existing research platform at Iowa State University (ISU) to support a variety of IoT research, ranging from IoT Informatics to IoT-based Intelligent Physical Systems to IoT Security Attacks and Prevention. It will be freely available to the general public upon completion, so that experimenters can undertake hands-on activities with IoT networking and cyber security. In addition, IoTE^3 will be integrated with ISU's Cyber Defense Competition (CDC) platform, exposing students and faculty to the security challenges specific to the IoT. <br/><br/>IoTE^3 will be built upon the existing ISEAGE (Internet Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment), which creates a virtual Internet for the purpose of researching, designing, and testing cyber defense mechanisms. In the controlled ISEAGE environment, real-world events and attacks can be tested against different configurations of the environment, unlike computer-based simulations. Currently, ISEAGE is limited to emulation of events and attacks on the traditional Internet. IoTE^3 is proposed to enhance and expand ISEAGE for IoT research. IoTE^3 provides a unique emulation environment based on the integration of physical and cyber environment that is scalable, flexible and realistic. The physical environment will consist of physical networks of actual IoT devices. Each of these physical IoT networks can host small-scale localized experiments by itself. They also can be connected to the ISEAGE to host larger-scale experiments. The cyber environment will consist of multiple high-end servers (IoT emulators) to host a configurable number of virtual IoT networks. Each virtual network can be configured as either a trace-based emulation to replay IoT traffic captured from the physical environment, or a model-based emulation to generate synthetic traffic based on models learned from the captured IoT traffic. The cyber and physical environments will be connected and interact with each other through ISEAGE."

These storms initiate at the foothills of the Andes Mountains as well as the Sierras de Crdoba (SDC) and produce extreme lightning amounts, large hail, tornadoes and heavy rainfall. The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of characteristics and causes of lightning in this understudied region of uniquely intense storms and differences in electrification between these storms and other convective storms in different environments that lead to such high impact weather.<br/> <br/>Towards these goals, researchers at the University of Colorado (CU) and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) will study atmospheric conditions and physical processes that control storm electrification and lead to extreme lightning flash rates in conjunction with other high impact weather. Measurements of these severe storms will be taken during the planned RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign to be able to address these goals. Such storms have a large economic impact as they pose a hazard to people, property, agriculture and infrastructure. An improved understanding of conditions and processes from the studied storms will lead to better nowcasting and forecasting of severe weather. Furthermore, this project will support educational training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. They will participate in the scientific research through independent studies and participation in the RELAMPAGO field campaign and have the opportunity to collaborate with the US and international researchers from a multitude of disciplines.<br/><br/>Some fundamental relationships between meteorology and electrification are not completely understood, including a lack of knowledge of how microphysical and kinematic processes control the development of charge regions inside deep convective storms. Recent studies in the US suggest that regional differences between microphysical, dynamical and electrical behavior exist. Thus, more research in different regions of the world such as in Argentina is needed to understand the physical connections between storm processes, electrification and lightning characteristics. The team of researchers from CU and UAH will investigate the environmental conditions and physical processes that control storm electrification and lead to extreme lightning flash rates of severe storms in west-central Argentina. The goal of the research is to advance understanding of storms producing extreme flash rates and of differences in electrification among convective storm types and environments that lead to high impact weather. This includes determining what role various storm environmental, kinematic and microphysical processes play in governing charge, charge region development and resultant flash rates and other properties (e.g., type, size, polarity, current, charge neutralized) in these extremely severe storms.

Timing analysis is a core EDA technology. It is the task of analyzing the timing of electrical signals propagating through various parts of the chip, thus allowing designers to determine if a design meets performance requirement. Given the ever-increasing chip design complexity, the need to efficiently analyze circuit timing with billions of transistors is quickly becoming the major bottleneck to the overall chip design process. A typical approach to mitigate this issue is to break down a chip design into several partitions and run timing analysis in parallel using the multiple cores in a single computer. For today's billion-scale designs, generating timing reports can consume up to 400 GB memory. The proposed research will advance knowledge in EDA by addressing this need. It will also add new knowledge to other fields such as general distributed computing and network optimization since ultimately we will need to solve large-scale optimization problems in distributed environment. The broader impacts of this project include microchip design technology advancement and the education of next generation engineers. Microchips are at the heart of modern information and communication systems. The proposed research improves chip design technology that will benefit the society at large. New research results will be passed on to undergraduate and graduate students through dissertation research, course projects, homework, and classroom teaching.<br/><br/>As the design complexity continues to grow larger, building a high-end computer is neither cost-effective nor scalable. Therefore, recent trends are driving the requirement for distributed timing analysis (DTA) in EDA tools. However, DTA has by far received little research attention and remains a critical problem. A successful distributed timer means not only a faster path to design completion but also the chance of breaking cumbersome design hierarchies, which has the potential to tremendously improve the overall quality of design. Distributed timing is also one of the major hurdles to overcome for EDA to be cloud-friendly, which is believed to deliver the next leap of design productivity and unleash new opportunities. This research proposal proposes to build an efficient, scalable, robust and secure distributed timing analysis system."

Recently, a new type of galaxy was discovered, the so-called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs).  These galaxies contain dark matter but, it seems, little else.  This makes UDGs great places to test theories of galaxy formation.  UDGs could also provide clues about the nature of dark matter.

Some view these as preconditions for creative economies that can transform productive landscapes. Others are concerned with the extent to which these regimes have generated precarity in the labor force. But what conclusions can be made when the focus of study is on those who have historically functioned outside the discipline of contract labor practices, such as artisans, merchants, and middlemen? This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, addresses a broader phenomenon that economists refer to as ""disintermediation,"" in which middlemen are being cut out of industries and supply-chains. Global in scope and interconnected in configuration, disintermediation is rapidly transforming the lives of workers everywhere: in the fast-fashion apparel and fair trade coffee supply-chains, the hospitality and tourism sectors, and the taxi service industry. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of economic precarity.<br/> <br/>Samuel Shuman, under the supervision of Dr. Jatin Dua of the University of Michigan, will explores what role disintermediation has in the reorganization of labor. The research takes place among a Hasidic community in Antwerp, Belgium, who is now in the process of reskilling its male workforce and refashioning them into local entrepreneurs. After World War II, thousands of Jewish refugees fled Eastern Europe to Western Europe. Among these refugees were Hasidim, a pietistic sect of Judaism, which landed in the port-city of Antwerp. Over 80% of its workforce depended upon the diamond industry for their economic livelihoods. In recent years, however, through the rise of national and supranational forms of regulation and e-commerce, Hasidic Jews are being cut out as middlemen in the diamond supply-chain. Within the context of this transition, the study asks three series of questions: 1) How are attitudes toward work, value, and virtue becoming reshaped through this economic transformation and through austerity policies? 2) How is surveillance informing how transactions are both conducted within the regulated industry and within an emerging, local community of entrepreneurs? 3) What does this economic transition reveal about the role of the middleman within the long history of global Capitalism and what might it illuminate about a new phase of Capitalism where middlemen may no longer be needed? Data will be gathered through a range of established ethnographic techniques over a 12-month period, including participant observation and interviews among attendees at a vocational school, traders, brokers, and artisans in the diamond bourse. In contributing to scientific work in legal and economic anthropology, this project emphasizes the economic middleman as the exemplary figure through which to understand the reorganization of modern political economies and the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion within these worlds."

The net result will be a highly flexible and powerful tool that is simple enough to be built in academic laboratories for support of specialized experiments.  It may also be attractive for commercial development to support a wide range of commonly performed experiments.  Possible application areas range from field measurements (including extraterrestrial applications) to laboratory-based measurements that require high mass resolution and mass accuracy at relatively low cost.

It seeks experimental evidence of a new theoretical model of soil fracturing.  The findings will then be used to develop a field monitoring tool that provides early warning of soil fracturing.  The project specifically utilizes the following two problems in geotechnical engineering as part of a case scenario-based study.  The first problem is related to land subsidence induced by groundwater extraction that is prevalent in many areas of the United States.  For example, in the San Joaquin Valley, California, more than half of the valley has subsided in excess of 0.3m; subsidence of 10 m and a rate of more than 0.3m/year has been reported in some areas.  When differential compaction occurs near groundwater extraction wells and local variations in geology, cracks may develop in the surrounding ground.  Such land subsidence induced fracture zones may be as much as 200 m wide and consist of multiple parallel, branching fissures and graben blocks.  These features are reported to cause billions of dollars of damage to critical built infrastructure. However, monitoring technology that effectively gives early warning to soil fracture development is not available at present.  The second problem is related to possible earthquake-induced damage of deep cut-off walls used in river levees that are constructed to reduce its flood risk.  For example, the Greater Sacramento area in California is among the most at-risk regions in America for catastrophic flooding.  The area relies on an aging system of levees, and massive levee improvements are currently underway.  A typical improvement involves installation of deep cut off walls with additional fill to raise the levee in order to mitigate under-seepage failure of the levees.  During an earthquake, the walls can be at risk of fracturing as the levee system deforms.  As a consequence, the ability to control seepage in a future flooding event may be lost. Again, an early warning monitoring system is needed to assess the risk of such soil fractures during the lifetime of operation.<br/><br/>When soil fracture occurs, it is likely to be localized and scale-dependent and therefore the locations of the failure will be difficult to predict. This uncertainty in the soil fracturing process can potentially lead to significant engineering issues and any monitoring technology that provides early detection is needed. To make a step change in our fundamental understanding of soil fracturing process, experimental evidence that supports new theoretical models and tools to measure it in the field are required.  This project aims to explore for the experimental evidence of multi-physics and multi-scale soil-pore water interaction occurring during deformation induced soil fracture initiation and propagation and to demonstrate the feasibility of high resolution distributed fiber optic strain sensing technology for detecting an early signature of soil fracturing.  The primary goals of the project are (i) test for experimental evidence of multi-physics and multi-scale soil-pore water interaction occurring during deformation induced soil fracture initiation and propagation, and (ii) to demonstrate the feasibility of high resolution distributed fiber optic strain sensing technology for detecting an early signature of soil fracturing.  In this project, a series of flexural tests will be performed on soil beam specimens, in which miniature pore pressure transducers and fiber optic sensing cables will be embedded.  The project will investigate the excess pore pressure generation and dissipation during the soil fracture initiation and propagation process.  It is hypothesized that different micro-scale failure modes inside a fracture process zone would be captured by high resolution distributed fiber optic strain sensing technology. The feasibility of the technology for a field-based early warning system against soil fracturing will be examined."

Teachers are inequitably distributed across schools, where high-need schools have higher teacher turnover rates, teachers with fewer educational credentials, and teachers with less experience. Skilled STEM teachers are more important than ever because of the increased rigor of new standards in science and mathematics, and the growing need for a well-prepared STEM workforce. Although teacher effectiveness increases over time, because high-need schools tend to have more inexperienced teachers, it is imperative that new STEM teachers enter the classroom prepared to deliver quality instruction, and that they persist in those schools as they improve. Findings from this study have the potential to: a) identify program features that are essential to the production of effective, rigorous STEM teachers that persist in high-need settings; and b) provide schools with specific coursework and field experiences to look for as they hire new teachers. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish correlations between features of STEM teacher preparation and induction programs and beginning STEM teachers' instructional quality and persistence over the first three years of their teaching careers. The sample for the study consists of over 100 first year teachers prepared across seven geographically dispersed (CA, CO, FL, NC, NJ, NY) Noyce Scholarship programs who are teaching in high-need schools. Data from 6 task assignments and associated student work samples in science and mathematics will be used to assess the quality of teachers' instruction, specifically the academic rigor and clear expectations they present to their students. Using both linear regression and HLM, the project will investigate the relationships between teacher preparation program coursework, field experiences, induction supports, and quality of instruction. Additionally, using logistic regression, the investigators will examine the relationships between these features of preparation and induction and the likelihood of teachers persisting past their Noyce commitment into their third year of teaching. Finally, also using logistic regression, the project will investigate whether the quality of teachers' instruction is associated with their likelihood of persisting past their Noyce commitment. There is a substantial gap in the research literature regarding the relationships between teacher preparation and induction and the quality of teachers' instruction. This study aims to contribute research-based knowledge to this issue, as well as to provide guidance on specific areas where teacher preparation programs can focus program improvement efforts. This project will also form the foundation for future quasi-experimental research that focuses on significant features of preparation and induction."

Gel and capillary electrophoresis are two dominant molecule separation technologies based on charge/size dispersion. The research objective of this proposal is to explore a novel nanofluidic molecular charge-coupled device (CCD) suitable for integrated electro-fluidic molecular separation and sensing, fundamentally different from the conventional gel and capillary electrophoresis. The proposed nanofluidic molecular CCD is based on the unique field effect coupling in nanofluidic systems, in which new transport behavior and functionality can be developed by leveraging the unique electrostatic coupling at the nanometer. The success of the proposed project will transform the biomolecule sensing and separation by exploring the rich properties of the novel nanofluidic molecular CCD. The project also includes education and outreach activities to tightly integrate the research efforts and results with graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education and to globally disseminate both research and the education outcomes.<br/><br/>Molecule transport at nanometer scale plays an important role in many biological, chemical, physical and engineering systems. Nanoscale channels offer a unique platform to explore new phenomena appearing for molecule confined in nanometers scales. New transport behavior and functionalities can be developed by taking advantage of the specific couplings occurring at these scales. Despite the fact that CCD image sensors have been indispensable tools for a variety of applications in various scientific and engineering disciplines, a similar bucket brigade transport and analysis of charged biomolecules in nanochannels has not been explored and realized. The proposed research will explore the field effect controlled bucket brigade transport of charged molecules by rational design, simulation, fabrication, and validation of a novel nanofluidic molecule CCD device. The outcome of the research will enable a paradigm shift in controllable molecule transport and separation. The major challenges in realizing a CCD-like device for bucket brigade transport and analysis are the lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamic electric field coupling to the charged molecules at the nanoscale, and the lack of feasible top-down engineered fabrication methods to produce the metal-insulator-nanochannel (MIN) structure. The proposed research objectives will be achieved through the following three aims: (i) Understand the device physics of nanofluidic molecular CCD, (ii) Explore viable device fabrication and integration techniques, and (iii) Investigate nanofluidic molecular CCDs for biomolecule transport and separation."

For computational reasons, analyses of data (big or otherwise) have tended to be simple and focused more on the difficulties of manipulating the data than on realistic scientific models. The next generation of Bayesian inference can take scientists beyond this impasse, via sophisticated models that can adjust for differences between sample and population, and between treatment and control groups, to join the benefits of large datasets with the rigor and power of statistical adjustment. Stan further helps educate the next generation of data scientists, with a natural, easy-to-learn and portable modeling language, coupled with robust, practical inference tools. The specific goal of this project is to solidify the Stan code base to enable application, maintenance, and development of the Stan software. Stan is being applied in many corners of the physical, biological, and social sciences, hundreds of at scales ranging from the neutrinos to supernovas, from cellular biology to population ecology, and from human reaction times to social network evolution. In this project the PI aims to document and ruggedize the core infrastructure of Stan to enable it to be used by a wider audience of scientists, to be maintained by a wider group of software developers, and to be extensible to allow for the future development of new scientific applications and statistical algorithms.<br/><br/>Technically, this project is devoted to thoroughly documenting for users and developers, testing at the unit, integration, and functional levels, and inevitably refactoring the application programming interfaces (API) of Stan's components. These components include (1) an automatically differentiable mathematics, statistics, and matrix algebra library, (2) an imperative probabilistic programming language for expressing statistical data/parameter structures and scientific/measurement models, (3) core inference algorithms for providing exact and approximate full Bayesian parameter estimation and predictive inference, (4) a service layer of high-level commands, I/O callbacks, and interrupts, and (5) interfaces integrating Stan's probability modeling, analysis and visualization capabilities into existing data science workflows in languages including R, Python, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, Mathematica and the command-line for cloud and cluster computing. The main goal of the refactoring is to achieve enough modularity in system components and documentation that developers will be able to concentrate on a single component, such as a new function, algorithm, or visualization, as well as to allow Stan to be used as a research tool for algorithm development. These goals complement the goals of documenting the language and interfaces in order to promote rigorous statistical methodology and reproducible computational workflows for applied scientists."

The intellectual merits are that the project is (1) developing new tools for maintaining computer systems, (2) designing models of computer systems that are amenable to analysis and verification, and (3) advancing the state of the art in formal methods for system administration tools. The project's broader significance and importance are that (1) it directly addresses a current and urgent problem that affects the nation's computing infrastructure, (2) it is developing tools that system administrators will be able to use, and (3) it will spur further research and development in this important area by publishing and releasing its products as open source software.<br/><br/>This project leverages recent advances in program verification and program synthesis to make system administration dramatically easier. Instead of proposing completely new abstractions that would be unfamiliar to system administrators, the project is developing techniques that are applicable to mainstream system configuration languages, such as Puppet, Chef, and Ansible. The project is developing tools to verify both universal properties of configurations and configuration-specific properties that govern how components of complex systems interact. Moreover, since real system configurations often invoke external commands, the project is also investigating a model-learning approach to accommodate them.  Finally, even verified configurations need to be updated, and updates introduce new errors. To address this problem, the project is developing new abstractions to make configuration updates dramatically easier."

The versatility of the 'molecular balances' enables the study of a broader range of molecular surfaces and environments and the direct comparison of their attractive or repulsive forces.  First, an expansive database of experimentally measured interactions is collected using a 'molecular balance'.  The 'balance' flips between two conformational states in which an intramolecular aromatic interaction is formed and broken.  Thus, the conformational ratio provides a sensitive and accurate measure of these weak interactions. Second, the importance and magnitude of individual contributing forces to the aromatic interactions is evaluated.  Of particular interest are the dispersion and solvophobic terms as their role in solution is still unclear.  Finally, a multivariate approach is employed using multiple molecular and solvent descriptors to develop a more accurate predictive model and also to assess the relative strengths of the contributing forces."

Dr. Walker involves students in electrochemistry, device design, nanoscience, surface and materials characterization, spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies. <br/><br/>In this work, Dr. Amy Walker (University of Texas at Dallas) is funded by the Macromolecular, Supermolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to develop new and scalable techniques used to synthesize metal chalcogenide nanostructures. Semiconductor nanowire deposition on micropatterned substrates (SENDOM) can create nanowires, nanopores, nanochannels and nanorings, which enables the fabrication of complex functional structures such as nanowire-based transistors. In SENDOM, a multifunctional micropatterned surface is used to direct the growth of nanostructures by chemical bath deposition (CBD). SENDOM is an in situ method that does not use complex lithography - these are significant advantages over other methods for nanostructures synthesis and placement. SENDOM relies on control of the interaction of CBD precursors and additives with organic thin films. Detailed mechanistic information about these interactions is also being leveraged to develop in situ solution-based techniques to selectively deposit and form free-standing transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) nanofilms. This research program substantially advances the state-of-the-art in nanotechnology by enabling the integration of nanostructures in practical devices.  Finally, solution-based methods such as those used in this work are becoming increasingly important in ""high-tech"" industries, and Dr. Walker is developing educational modules to train students at all levels in this area."

As transfer students continue to use community colleges as stepping stones to pursue STEM degrees, it is important to understand the unique challenges these students encounter and the diversity within this important student population. This study will develop a transfer student typology and investigate its relationships with transfer students' STEM choice, performance, persistence, and STEM degree attainment. As one of the first efforts to develop such a typology on an important, yet frequently ignored student population in STEM education, the research will advance knowledge by building better connections between transfer typology and educational outcomes and college experiences. This step will be critical to identifying what significantly different subgroups of transfer students demonstrate different patterns in achieving STEM success. This information will help higher education institutions allocate resources more effectively and efficiently to tailor interventions to each of the transfer subgroups. This approach will provide a more holistic understanding of transfer students' pathways to STEM success and nuanced differences between each of the transfer subpopulations. <br/><br/>Data will be collected through a mixed-method approach to understand the extent to which community college transfer students vary based on their beliefs, goals, and behaviors. Quantitative methods will be used to identify the specific typology groups existing in community college transfer students. The project will then investigate the relationships between transfer typology reference groups and students' STEM choice, performance, persistence, and completion of STEM baccalaureate degrees. A series of in-depth qualitative interviews with students in each reference group will provide a deeper understanding of unique challenges that transfer students experience. The interviews will also uncover how these students navigate their ways to college and STEM education, what strategies they have applied, and what policies and practices should be developed to best facilitate transfers of each group to achieve academic success. Outcomes from this research study will offer researchers, faculty members, administrators, and policymakers in higher education meaningful insights into the diversity and complexity of the transfer student population. More importantly, this project takes a step further to build connections between the transfer typology and educational outcomes and college experiences for each of the transfer reference groups, and thus it can lead to development and implication of tailored support for transfer students. The findings can also suggest effective intervention and prevention programs that help transfer students avoid taking missteps and wrong turns as they progress to obtaining baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields of study, transforming access into success for transfer students."

Network theory, which is the subject of this research project, provides a mathematical representation of systems like these which helps us to understand and predict their behavior.  This project focuses on modeling networked systems, using mathematical models and computer models.  Network models have seen impressive successes in recent years, in areas such as computer and information networks and epidemiology, but a fundamental shortcoming of previous work has been an inability to accurately represent network structure at both small and large scales simultaneously.  This project develops new classes of models that achieve this goal, thereby more accurately representing networks as they appear in real life and improving our understanding and ability to predict their behavior.  Specific goals of the project include: development of new multiscale mathematical and computer models of networked systems; testing and validation of models to demonstrate how well they capture the features of the systems they represent; model selection methods for determining how best to represent a particular system; anomaly detection in networks; improved computational methods to allow calculations to run efficiently on current computer hardware; and a range of specific applications, for instance to modeling of network resilience and the spread of disease.   <br/><br/>This project will develop and apply new classes of mathematical models for representing and analyzing networked systems.  Network models find wide uses in methods for the analysis of network data, such as community detection, embedding, and visualization, and as the foundation for simulation and modeling of network processes, such as resilience of systems to failure of their components, the spread of diseases over contact networks, or the design and refinement of network protocols and algorithms.   A fundamental shortcoming of current network models, however, is their inability to capture network structure accurately on both small and large scales.  Models based on local structural motifs, such as the configuration model or subgraph models, capture small-scale structure well, but fail with large-scale structure such as communities, stratification, or core-periphery structure.  Models that capture large-scale structure, such as block models, are normally locally tree-like and hence fail badly to capture the small scale.  This project will develop a new class of random graph models that naturally integrates the large and small, along with methods for analyzing the models' properties and for rapid Monte Carlo sampling.  Maximum-likelihood fitting methods will be developed to fit models to real-world network data, enabling accurate generalization, link prediction, and network reconstruction.  Statistical methods for the models will also be developed, including goodness-of-fit tests and model selection methods, along with specific applications, for instance to anomaly detection, network resilience, and epidemic modeling."

In particular, Professor Allison records snapshots of the vibrations of hydrogen bonds between water molecules when a few water molecules stick together in a ring but are otherwise isolated from the environment. These snapshots of simple systems help to understand how the motions of hydrogen atoms in more complex networks such as liquid water are coupled to one another. The information allows scientists to make better computer models of hydrogen-bonded matter. The new ultrafast spectrometers developed by the Allison Lab will be able to record signals from much more dilute samples than currently possible. Professor Allison's techniques, once developed, can be used to study motions of other molecular systems and find many uses in fundamental and applied research.  For example, the developed technique could allow scientists to study how water molecules interact with each other to understand how clouds form or to study how protein molecules interact with their surrounding molecules to understand enzymatic functions in biological processes.Professor Allison works with graduate and undergraduate students closely in the research. He also participates in a school summer program on campus targeting high school students. <br/><br/>Ultrafast optical spectroscopy methods, such as transient absorption spectroscopy and two-dimensional spectroscopy, are widely used across many disciplines. However, these techniques have been typically restricted to optically thick samples, such as solids and liquid solutions. Professor Allison and his group work on a widely tunable cavity-enhanced ultrafast spectrometer and apply it to the dynamics of elementary hydrogen bond networks. This involves substantial instrument development in concert with a series of experiments on jet-cooled gas-phase molecules and clusters. Cavity-enhanced two-dimensional infrared (CE-2DIR) spectroscopy is another technique to be developed to study hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimers. The study of small deuterated water clusters will provide critical data for understanding and modeling the complexities of liquid water. The development of a widely tunable cavity-enhanced ultrafast spectrometer is expected to open new opportunities for many future applications where classic ultrafast spectroscopy has been limited by its sensitivity and spectral information.

The ultimate goal of the work is the discovery of design principles for the construction of molecular machines and molecular-sized devices that can more easily integrate with existing technologies.  A goal is to gain a better understanding of molecular motion.  Control of molecular motion is crucial for the design of new approaches for unique new applications, including tiny molecular-sized pumps, sensors, and optoelectronics. To engage broad audiences in this project, the Sykes research team gives presentations about nanoscienceat local high schools with newly developed demonstrations.

Their utility is somewhat limited, however, by difficulties associated with coupling them with either each other or with interfaces such as electrodes.  This project takes a new approach using molecular self-assembly to produce 2D crystalline arrays of molecular rotors that display emergent properties like correlated rotational switching.  The arrays are synthesized by the Ullmann reaction of precursor molecular rotors with a Cu (111) surface, yielding 2D networks of metal-organic complexes in which the rotary units can interact with each other.  Scanning tunneling microscopy enables excitation of the individual rotor groups and the ability to study how reorientation of an individual molecular rotor affects its neighbors.  By studying the effect of voltage, current, and tunneling gap distance on rotor motion, the mechanism of excitation will be explored.  Altering the size and functionality of the precursor molecules enables control over the placement of the rotor units in the 2D molecular crystals and the ability to study the effect of rotor-rotor spacing and angle on correlated rotational switching.  By changing the functionality of the rotor itself, both steric and dipolar coupling will be explored.  Finally, chiral rotary units will be introduced as a way to induce unidirectional rotation via a flashing temperature ratchet-like mechanism."

Thus, broadening participation in engineering from underrepresented groups is a critical priority. To meet this need, this project focuses on economically disadvantaged rural students, particularly women and other underrepresented groups. Traditional models of career choice stressing interest as a primary career choice driver break down in rural contexts, where instead community values, local economic drivers, and strong family networks often play a critical role. As a result, this project shifts the focus from individual students to the communities themselves to understand how key stakeholders and organizations support the career choices of rural youth. With this knowledge, the investigators will engage target rural communities in participatory design workshops so that they might leverage their unique community assets to support more of their youth, particularly underrepresented groups, to pursue engineering careers. <br/><br/>The project begins with focus group and individual interviews with undergraduate engineering students from selected rural high schools that are known for producing high numbers of engineering majors. These data lay the foundation for interviews with key members of students' home communities and observations of salient programs or events to provide a rich understanding of the beliefs, experiences, and values of each community. Data analysis includes both within-case and cross case analysis. Further, the results of the multi-case study will be used to guide participatory design workshops with rural schools and communities in the region that do not typically produce engineering majors. These workshops will foster dialogue that explores factors that support or hinder transfer of practices to low-producing schools and identifies policies and strategies that would enhance each community's ability to better support engineering as a potential career choice. The study uses the southwestern region of Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains, as its primary focus, but research on career choice among rural students generally points to the potential transferability of the findings and methods. This project advances knowledge about engineering career choice and rural education by capturing the perspectives of community members who often play key roles in students' career and academic decisions, particularly in rural communities."

Current theories of second language acquisition maintain that accurate second language sound perception is 1) correlated with speakers' production ability on an individual level and 2) dependent on observable similarities between the native and target language. This project tests these hypotheses with experimental and naturally collected language data. Examining these effects is the first step toward identifying areas of difficulty for learners of any given second language, which will contribute to development of educational methods tailored to any individual learner and language in question. The results of this project have the potential to advance both English as a Second Language initiatives and foreign language education methods in the U.S.<br/><br/>Using methods drawn from phonological, phonetic, and psycholinguistic research, this project tests the above predictions with data collected from an understudied population of Welsh-Spanish bilinguals in Argentina.

A reading task will elicit productions of Welsh and Spanish vowels from the test group and control populations of Welsh speakers in Wales and Argentine Spanish monolinguals. Statistical analysis of control group speech will be used to predict which Welsh vowel contrasts are likely to challenge native speakers of Spanish. Results will be compared to 1) bilinguals' accuracy in vowel identification and discrimination and 2) the similarity of bilinguals' vowel productions to those of the control groups. Understanding the challenges of vowel contrast acquisition for this population will result in scalable predictions regarding the nature and consequences of second language acquisition for the field of bilingualism."

How those correlations are manifest depends on multiple parameters, which can be used to tune the complex systems. For example, the state of matter observed in very low temperatures can be controlled by an external parameter, like magnetic field, strain or carrier doping. Such tuning is performed to investigate new and uncharacterized states of matter, to control the physical properties within one state or another, to provide insight where prevailing understandings break down, and to  investigate the potential for applications through optimization. In this project, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is applied in versatile ways to selected systems subjected to variable magnetic fields and uniaxial strain. The specific objectives range from studies of the properties of otherwise inaccessible states of matter, to clarifying questions unresolved by other means. NMR is used because it provides a window into the local electronic environment. Both graduate and undergraduate students are trained in cryogenic, radiofrequency, and simulation technologies, with opportunities to train and collaborate with research groups located at user facilities in the United States and abroad, such as the National MagLab in Tallahassee. In addition to the transfer of science, technology and hardware between research groups initiated by these collaborations, the students benefit from exposure to complementary expertise by way of interactions with scientists working in other areas, and through extended visits to facilities. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This project employs solid state magnetic resonance techniques to address questions associated with quasi-two dimensional superconductors and frustrated quantum magnets. The approach integrates nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with different combinations of extreme conditions, specifically uniaxial strain, high magnetic fields, and temperatures ranging to less than 1 K. The objective is to study the nature of induced phases and excitations. NMR is well-suited for this task since the technique is generally sensitive to the local magnetic and charge environment through the hyperfine interaction and nuclear quadrupolar coupling to the electric field gradient. <br/>The strain method has potential for broader application since it can be varied continuously in situ; here it will be employed in a compound long-considered a chiral p-wave superconductor. Through transport and susceptibility studies, dramatic, non-monotonic changes in the critical temperature were demonstrated. NMR experiments will inform as to strain-induced changes to both normal and superconducting states, including changes to Fermi surface topology and density of states, identification of an anticipated split superconducting transition, or a transition between different superconducting orders. High magnetic fields will be utilized to stabilize and study the physical properties of inhomogeneous superconductivity in a quasi-2D compound for which where orbital suppression of the superconducting state is avoided as a result of uncommonly large electronic structure anisotropy."

The neuro-inspired architecture leverages the distributed computation in the neuron nodes and the localized storage in the synaptic elements. The neuron node today is generally implemented by tens of silicon transistors. Compared to the crossbar array of synaptic elements, the silicon neuron is power-hungry and area-inefficient, thereby reducing the parallelism of computing system. In such context, how to design a single device that can efficiently emulate the neuronal behavior (e.g. integrate-and-fire) is critical to the neuromorphic hardware design. This project aims to exploit the metal-insulator-transition phenomenon in strongly correlated oxides as a compact neuron node that can self-oscillate, namely oxide neuron, to overcome the aforementioned limitations of silicon neuron. The proposed research will have a profound impact on the society that is embracing the artificial intelligence. For instance, a compact design of neuromorphic hardware may enable intelligent information processing on power-efficient mobile platforms, e.g. autonomous vehicle, personalized healthcare, wearable devices, and smart sensors. The objective of the research and education integration is to train undergraduate/graduate students and next-generation workforce with interdisciplinary skills. The cross-layer nature of this project ranging from materials engineering, semiconductor device, circuit-device interaction and artificial neural network provides an ideal platform for this educational goal. The project also plans to engage minority and unrepresentative students in research. Technology transfer will be performed through video or on-site seminars and student internships with industrial collaborators.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this research is to advance the artificial neuron device design by exploiting the volatile and threshold switching behavior in strongly correlated oxides, with the purpose of significantly reducing the area and energy of the neuron node, and making it compatible for the integration with crossbar array of resistive synaptic elements. The scope of the project is to explore various material systems of the strongly correlated oxides, in particular, NbO2 and SmNiO3 to demonstrate the self-oscillation behavior in the artificial neuron node. When such oxide device is connected with a series synaptic element whose resistance is within the on/off dynamic range of the oxide device, the node voltage between the oxide device and the synaptic element will start self-oscillation, and the oscillation frequency represents the synaptic conductance. This project aims to explore such self-oscillation to emulate the integrate-and-fire neuronal behavior. To achieve the aforementioned research goal, device fabrication, physical and electrical characterization, device modeling, and circuit-device co-design will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and further optimize the device performance. The intellectual significance of this project is two folded. From the fundamental science perspective, the physical switching mechanism of metal-insulator-transition in strongly correlated oxides will be investigated. From the applied engineering perspective, the oxide neuron device will be integrated with the resistive crossbar array for demonstration of a neural network for solving a practical problem, i.e. the image pattern classification."

The objective is to create the capability for such movement without duplicating the full complexity and articulation of the human torso. Specifically, the project will implement a novel mechanism for shifting a heavy mass that shifts the robot center of mass independently of limb movements using novel muscle-like actuators, and evaluate the results based on a formal system of movement analysis developed for dance, athletics, and physical therapy. In addition to improving the robot's effectiveness at accomplishing locomotion, i.e., a walking gait, these capabilities will provide new channels for communication between robots and humans, i.e., modulating the style of the walking gait. Humans make unconscious inferences about attitude and intent from observing movement. For example, a robot co-worker will be more effective if its movements communicate trustworthiness and competence to its human partners, and a robot first-responder will be more effective if its movements communicate confidence and leadership during an emergency situation. This project incorporates the interplay of art and technology into outreach activities, such as using dance movements to understand fundamentals of robot locomotion.<br/> <br/>This project takes a novel approach to generating dynamic walking in a humanoid robot, by exploiting the dynamics of a novel, core-located rolling ball-and-tray actuation mechanism arising from exploration of embodied movement theory. The impedance of the actuator is varied in real time, modulating the robot dynamics to produce qualitatively different excitations. The focus of the project is on controlling the expressive character of robot gait, with explicit comparison to human movement. The goals of the project are to explore the role of center-of-mass control in human walking and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for bipedal robotic walking through modeling, simulation, and an initial prototype. The work will model and validate the ball-and-tray actuator via a set of motion primitives designed in accordance with Bartenieff Fundamentals, a formal system of movement analysis. The research team brings together experts in movement science, dynamic walking, and muscle-like actuation. In addition to improving robot performance, this work has the potential to increase the bandwidth of robot-human communications. Expressive movement can convey many different emotional contexts, including urgency, calm, enthusiasm, confidence, et cetera. The ability to engineer these contexts into robot movement has many potential applications in human facing scenarios."

This project explores how ultrasonic energy, combined with low-temperature heat sources, can realize higher-efficiency adsorption cooling by increasing the rate at which refrigerant vapor is released from the surface of a solid adsorbent.  This in effect creates a thermal compressor that replaces the conventional electric-powered compressor.  At this point, however, the mechanisms by which ultrasound interacts with adsorbed liquid refrigerant are not clear, and these are examined through both experiments and theoretical modeling.  This project also involves significant educational and outreach activities.  To date there has been no central, online, open-source resource for thermally activated heat pump technologies.  In addition to assembling and making available open-source simulation codes and performance data that make it easier to design improved systems, online educational modules are developed for enhancing the understanding of students and practitioners in this field and thus promote wider development and adoption of environmentally friendly heat pump technologies.<br/><br/>Although prior work clearly indicates the potential to improve desorption by applying ultrasonic energy, in general this prior work focused on system-level effects rather than local detailed measurements that would enable improved fundamental understanding.  For example, how much of the improved desorption is due to localized heating, and how much is due to other effects such as mechanical compression/decompression, acoustic softening, etc.?  Our work, rather than emphasizing such system-level performance, instead focuses on detailed, localized measurements and analysis to improve fundamental understanding of these coupled heat and mass transport processes that are crucial not only for adsorption cooling, but also for desiccant drying, food drying, etc.  We also explore a much wider range of adsorbents/refrigerants, in addition to the silica gel/water system studied earlier.  Interestingly, the application of ultrasound may enable new adsorbent materials to be utilized, such as superabsorbent polymers (commonly used in disposable diapers) that can absorb up to 2000 times their own weight in water. Without ultrasound, the use of polymers is limited or even prohibited because of the high temperatures needed for regeneration.  By examining alternative materials like superabsorbent polymers we are able to greatly expand the variety of adsorbent/refrigerant pairs that can be considered for application in adsorption cooling."

Accurate determination of protein structure is essential to understanding biological mechanism and designing new drugs. The purpose of this work is to use the petascale capabilities of Blue Waters to overcome limitations of current experimental and computational tools of structure determination.  The project will do this by running a physics-based simulation method, called MELD (Modeling Employing Limited Data) that rationally incorporates sparse, noisy, and ambiguous experimental or heuristic information. Currently around 15% of protein targets cannot be tackled by known methods. The transformative goal of this work is to use MELD, running on Blue Waters, to break substantial barriers in size and complexity for computational structure prediction.<br/><br/>This work has three major goals: (1) use MELD to provide structures for the known, small proteins were bioinformatics methods fail and where databases are sparse (e.g. membrane proteins), (2) provide kinetic and pathway information for protein folding by seeding Markov State Models (MSM) with MELD intermediate states, and (3) use accurate relative free energies of folding upon binding for more accurate peptide design. The project will use the the petascale capabilities of Blue Waters to push the size boundaries of full atomistic physics based predictions.  Both the software and the results obtained from this project will be freely accessible to the larger scientific community."

About 13,000 years ago many species of large mammals in the Americas became extinct. This research will examine the consequences of the loss of these large carnivores and herbivores from the food web to the remaining plant and animal communities. The responses seen at this long-ago event will be used to develop general concepts relevant to modern-day changes in plant and animal communities.

Patterns of abundance, distribution, diet and morphology in the surviving mammals both before and after the extinction event will be characterized. Using occurrence information from fossil database compilations, morphology and size will be determined by measuring fossil limbs and molars, and diet by using stable isotope analysis. These data will be integrated with reconstructions of vegetative communities using pollen databases and regional and global temperature records. An important ecological baseline for the understanding of contemporary trophic downgrading will be established by characterizing how terrestrial ecosystems were influenced by humans at an important point in human history."

Bimetallic nanocrystals, made of two different metal species, have properties that are often superior to their single-metal counterparts. The arrangement of the two different metals relative to each other in the nanocrystal is very important in determining the nanocrystal properties, and considerable effort has been made to deposit one metal atop the nanocrystal surface of another metal with precision in location.  It remains a grand challenge to detect and quantify the metal being deposited, particularly when the nanocrystals are still suspended in the reaction medium undergoing growth. Dr. Dong Qin addresses this challenge by developing a class of molecules, the isocyanides (molecules containing the -NC chemical group), as probes for in situ characterization with detection of the isocyanides by a spectroscopic technique, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The ultimate goal is to establish a scientific basis for enabling the rational synthesis of bimetallic nanocrystals with well-controlled compositions and shapes, which have broader societal impact through their need in a variety of applications. This research project encompasses multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, colloidal science, solid-state physics, photonics, and surface science, with a focus on the following components for student development: i)  active learning in interdisciplinary areas involved in understanding the structure and property relationships of nanomaterials; ii) training that provides hands-on experience in the synthesis of nanomaterials in the Qin laboratory, and on the characterization of nanomaterials in the state-of-the-art facilities at Georgia Tech and national laboratories; and iii) exposing the community and society, including high school students and teachers, to nanoscale science and technology concepts.<br/><br/>In this research, Dr. Dong Qin from the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to study the fundamentals involved in the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of bimetallic nanocrystals. Specifically, a novel class of isocyanide-based molecular probes (R-NC) are developed for in situ detection and analysis of the overgrowth of a second noble metal (M: Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh, or Ru) on Ag nanocrystals suspended in the original growth solution by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Because the binding of the isocyanide group to a metal surface is similar to that of carbon monoxide, it is anticipated that the stretching frequency of the NC bond differs when the isocyanide group binds to the Ag and M atoms, respectively. Therefore, it is feasible to monitor the M atoms being deposited onto Ag nanocrystals by following the stretching frequencies and intensities of NC vibration in real time. On the other hand, the SERS hot spots on the Ag nanocrystals can be designed to coincide with the sites favored by M atoms for heterogeneous nucleation, allowing for unprecedented sensitivity with a detection limit below one monolayer. By leveraging their consummate sensitivity toward metal atoms, the novel SERS probes open up new opportunities to elucidate the mechanistic details involved in the seeded overgrowth of a second noble metal on the surface of Ag nanocrystals. The mechanistic insights support the rational design and knowledge-based synthesis of bi- and multi-metallic nanocrystals for a variety of applications. This research project encompasses multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, colloidal science, solid-state physics, photonics, and surface science, with a focus on the following components for student development: i)  active learning in interdisciplinary areas involved in understanding the structure and property relationships of nanomaterials; ii) training that provides hands-on experience in the synthesis of nanomaterials in the Qin laboratory, and on the characterization of nanomaterials in the state-of-the-art facilities at Georgia Tech and national laboratories; and iii) exposing the community and society, including high school students and teachers, to nanoscale science and technology concepts."

The University's Middle School Mathematics and Science Teacher Certification Program focuses on helping future teachers learn ways to elicit and build upon middle grades students' common-sense knowledge and ways of thinking -- an approach used by exemplary teachers and supported by research about K-12 students' learning.  Many of the future teachers buy into this approach to teaching in principle, but once they graduate from the certification program and become professional teachers, many of them rarely if ever approach their teaching in this way.  This project explores why this occurs, with the goal of informing modifications to the certification program that could help teachers apply, more frequently and more fully, effective teaching practices learned in their certification program.  The project, funded by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, will inform improvements not only to the particular teacher preparation program studied in the project but to the hundreds of other programs that emphasize helping future teachers learn similar sets of effective teaching practices.<br/><br/>More specifically, the Middle School Teacher Certification Program mentioned above focuses on responsive teaching -- a set of approaches in which teachers consistently notice, attend to, interpret, and respond to the substance (as opposed to just the correctness) of students' ideas and adjust their instruction accordingly.  A growing body of research suggests that responsive teaching can help diverse students learn science, and a growing number of teacher education programs are attempting to support novice teachers' responsive teaching practices.  To help pre-service teachers (PSTs) learn responsive teaching, the Middle School Teacher Certification Program engages PSTs in pedagogies of practice-based teacher education:  PSTs observe models and representations of responsive teaching, they ""approximate"" responsive teaching by practicing with a classroom of virtual student ""avatars,"" and they enact responsive teaching in lessons in their early field experiences.  The goal of this research project is to explore the extent to which PSTs in the program focus on core practices of responsive teaching and enact responsive teaching practices in their student teaching as well as in their first years in the workforce.  The project takes a qualitative case study approach, triangulating between cases studies of particular program courses and longitudinal case studies of particular PSTs as they navigate the transition from the program into teaching.  The data collected includes video recordings of PSTs engaged in the practice-based pedagogies of the courses, recordings of each PST with the avatars, PSTs' program coursework, interviews with case-study participants, and observations and video recordings of case study participants in their student teaching and in their first year of teaching.  This small-N exploratory study helps articulate hypotheses and explanations about preparation for responsive teaching that will inform future large-N multi-institutional research and future design-based research on individual PST programs."

Through the examination of the colonial process in which pre-hispanic New World cultures were exposed to Christianity through Spanish colonization it is possible to examine multi-religion interaction over extended periods of time.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Mr. Victor Castillo will conduct archaeological investigations at Chiantla Viejo, a small highland Maya settlement that transitioned to Spanish colonial rule during the 16th century. In order to address the mechanism of community survival in colonial settings, Castillo's research will study how the continued use of the plaza by the local community for public concentrations and massive rituals left room for negotiation between external innovations and traditional ritual practices.  Combining the analysis of site layout, targeted excavations, and  laboratory analyses, this project will provide a substantive dataset to evaluate the dimension of culture change as a political outcome during a critical transitional period for small local communities. Castillos work will provide new grounds for addressing religious change beyond traditional models of acculturation and syncretism by studying a more complex and localized scenario of cultural interactions within the framework of colonialism. The investigations at Chiantla Viejo also integrates a constructive dialogue with the modern community surrounding the site since the place is treasured as the ancestral location of the modern town of Chiantla, thus raising awareness about the protection and preservation of the local archaeological patrimony.  Ultimately, this work will present a more proximate and locally situated account of the ways in which native Maya groups responded to the colonial impact and how pre-Hispanic communities managed to transition successfully to colonial life and even outlasted the Spanish domination up to modern times."

The first set of questions originates in biotechnology. Fast progress in modern biophysics requires new theoretical results on protein solutions (suspensions), particularly in the studies of protein diffusion and of transitions between globular and diffusive states. Diffusion processes in polymer solutions differ from classical diffusion -- while the diffusion coefficient grows linearly with temperature in the classical setting, it decreases near the critical temperature for proteins. A mathematical model for phase transitions in polymers will be developed, allowing one to explain this fact and to explore other near-critical phenomena. One of the possible applications is the analysis of the diffusion of medications in living tissue. The second part of the project concerns population dynamics. Some of the most important questions in this area concern the description of states that are homogeneous in space and time and the study of their stability with respect to local and random perturbations of the environment. These questions will be studied for a wide class of models, including cases with immigration and heavy-tailed migration in the population.

Practitioners in the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) community and policy makers face an urgency to re-envision learning and environments and workplaces to better support individuals in building critical and complex non-technical employability skillsets.   Based on a review of the research and practitioner literature, the cognitive employability skills associated with problem solving appear to enjoy a relatively robust level of investment and visibility, but the employability skills associated with interpersonal skills and the intrapersonal skills of coping and maintaining a positive ""mindset"" (e.g., positive attitude, persistence, and flexibility) are likely to occur informally and under the radar.   However, unlike technical skills, employability skills are ill defined.  Findings from the qualitative research study will yield research-based guidance for practitioners in education, policy makers, and employers to make informed decisions on how to promoted the development of employability skills and to advocate for needed resources.<br/> <br/>Addressing a gap in the literature on academic and career development in technician education, the targeted research project addresses will feature a qualitative research study that examines and synthesizes the literature and expert knowledge on employability skills.  Three questions are investigated in the exploratory empirical research study.  What are the employability skills? learning principles identified in the research and why are they important in technical contexts, such and Information Technology (IT) and Advanced Manufacturing (AM)?  What are the practices used to develop ad measure employability skills in IT and AM and how do the specifically support the needs of underrepresented groups?  What are the most promising directions for future development and evaluation o employability skills in workforce programming practice, research, and policy?  Three qualitative research methods will be used to answer the research questions.  This overall approach replicates the approach one taken in a previous investigation into general programs for supporting chronically unemployed and underemployed individuals and underrepresented minority adult students in post-secondary education and entry-level employment.  The narrative research synthesis is informed by the conceptualization of research syntheses proposed by Cooper (1998, 2006) and Campbell and associates (1992).  The Interviews with expert informants in workforce development, technician education, and the industry selected industry sectors will deepen an understanding of employability skills.  The systematic examination and iterative refinement of the synthesis of the research and expert knowledge will assess data saturation (e.g., knowing how many interviews are needed to provide sufficient codes and themes for replicable findings) and ensure support the development of stable data categories."

Recent reports by the Council of Graduate Schools reported that in engineering, the 10-year completion rate for doctoral programs for domestic students was only 59%. Attrition is problematic for several reasons. First, since many domestic students are funded by federal grants (through NSF, for example) and through domestic industry, each domestic student that leaves academia prematurely represents a lost investment. Second, graduate students are required for the continued quantity and quality of engineering research and development that supports all facets of engineering, impacting defense, biomedical applications, and energy technologies, and will be future thought-leaders in engineering industry and academic research. Even though engineering is usually represented solely as a mathematical and scientific discipline, being able to successfully write for an academic engineering audience can be the difference between completing a Ph.D. or leaving without a degree.  However, to date, no research has studied the linkage between engineering writing, attrition/persistence and career goals for engineering graduate students.  This study employs both qualitative interview techniques and statistical methods to study domestic graduate students who have decided to stay in graduate school and those that decided to leave academia. <br/><br/>According to Academic Literacies Theory, Role Identity Theory, and Vygotskian Sociocultural Theory applied to graduate students and academic writing, the ability to communicate as a member of a discipline (i.e., develop disciplinary discourse) is critical to the development of disciplinary identity and feelings of belonging to a research community. Other studies have linked these characteristics to persistence in graduate school; however, no work to date explores student attitudes and concepts of writing in engineering as it relates to attrition, persistence, and goals of careers in academia for graduate students. An exploratory embedded mixed methods approach with a qualitative emphasis is being conducted over the three years of this grant. This research design seeks to examine the writing approaches and attitudes of graduate students in graduate programs and in students who decided to leave academia before completing their graduate studies (non-completers). With the broader purpose of forming competencies and identities for future domestic faculty from graduate students, the guiding research questions for this study are as follows: (1) How do graduate students at various stages in their Ph.D. programs in engineering perceive the role of academic writing as it relates to academic persistence and the desire to pursue academic careers? (2) How are these perceptions different or similar for graduate students who are considering leaving or have left their Ph.D. programs before graduating? (3) Can writing concepts, attitudes, and self-efficacies (measured through survey constructs) predict or correlate strongly with graduate engineering students' attrition or persistence?  The intellectual merit of this work lies in the fundamental advancement of theories of engineering formation and socialization at the doctoral level, which to date are underexplored. Furthermore, the role that writing plays in the socialization process, including its potential relationship with the decision to leave academia has not been explored in a rigorous quantitative way in any discipline. As the broader impacts of the study, the findings of the study will facilitate the development of writing based interventions to increase the persistence of U.S. doctoral engineering students. Broader impacts activities include dissemination of research results via academic courses for graduate students, and workshops, webinars, and resources for graduate students and faculty."

The objective is to create the capability for such movement without duplicating the full complexity and articulation of the human torso. Specifically, the project will implement a novel mechanism for shifting a heavy mass that shifts the robot center of mass independently of limb movements using novel muscle-like actuators, and evaluate the results based on a formal system of movement analysis developed for dance, athletics, and physical therapy. In addition to improving the robot's effectiveness at accomplishing locomotion, i.e., a walking gait, these capabilities will provide new channels for communication between robots and humans, i.e., modulating the style of the walking gait. Humans make unconscious inferences about attitude and intent from observing movement. For example, a robot co-worker will be more effective if its movements communicate trustworthiness and competence to its human partners, and a robot first-responder will be more effective if its movements communicate confidence and leadership during an emergency situation. This project incorporates the interplay of art and technology into outreach activities, such as using dance movements to understand fundamentals of robot locomotion.<br/> <br/>This project takes a novel approach to generating dynamic walking in a humanoid robot, by exploiting the dynamics of a novel, core-located rolling ball-and-tray actuation mechanism arising from exploration of embodied movement theory. The impedance of the actuator is varied in real time, modulating the robot dynamics to produce qualitatively different excitations. The focus of the project is on controlling the expressive character of robot gait, with explicit comparison to human movement. The goals of the project are to explore the role of center-of-mass control in human walking and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for bipedal robotic walking through modeling, simulation, and an initial prototype. The work will model and validate the ball-and-tray actuator via a set of motion primitives designed in accordance with Bartenieff Fundamentals, a formal system of movement analysis. The research team brings together experts in movement science, dynamic walking, and muscle-like actuation. In addition to improving robot performance, this work has the potential to increase the bandwidth of robot-human communications. Expressive movement can convey many different emotional contexts, including urgency, calm, enthusiasm, confidence, et cetera. The ability to engineer these contexts into robot movement has many potential applications in human facing scenarios."

This continuous creation of enormous amounts of raw digital information demands new, efficient ways to extract useful content and filter out the noise inherent in any data-gathering process. Mathematical and computational techniques of data analysis offer powerful tools that can be brought to bear, but new challenges arise on a daily basis. This requires the constant refinement and improvement of existing techniques, as well as the development of new ones. This research project aims to produce a new body of mathematical knowledge and new computational techniques that will enhance the ability to tackle challenges arising from data-intensive fields of science and engineering including computer vision, compressed sensing, control, and others. Quantitative finance, network analysis and synthesis, and medical imaging are other areas where the research can be expected to have an impact. The principal investigator will study a class of mathematical objects known as generalized matrix functions and aims to exploit the resulting knowledge to develop new, efficient computer methods for data analysis. Training of a PhD student in computational mathematics is also an integral part of the project.<br/><br/>The principal investigator aims to develop the theory of generalized matrix functions, a type of matrix function based on the singular value decomposition of a (possibly rectangular) matrix. The resulting theory is intended to be the basis for the development of numerical methods for the efficient approximate evaluation of such matrix functions. The focus will be primarily on large-scale problems for which the (full) singular value decomposition cannot be computed. Techniques based on sparsity and low-rank approximations will be combined with Krylov-type methods (especially the Lanczos and Golub--Kahan algorithms) to design fast algorithms for solving a variety of problems involving generalized matrix functions. The algorithms will be applied to problems such as low-rank matrix optimization, the regularization of discrete inverse problems, and the analysis of directed networks. As a by-product of this research, new algorithms for the computation of standard matrix functions where the matrix argument is only available in factored form will be derived and analyzed. This research represents a new direction in numerical linear algebra and is expected to produce useful numerical tools for the solution of a variety of problems in data science and optimization."

He also will conduct interviews and focus groups with former police department officers and civilian employees about past technology use. Finally, he will evaluate these data against the backdrop of archival research tracing the development of police technologies from the automation of data processing in the 1950s to the analytics-driven policing model developing currently. Findings from this research will broaden insights into the role of technology in shaping police practices and public perception of police, safety, and urban governance. Conclusions will advance anthropological theory by extending work on actor-network theory and techno-politics to the study of urban governance and spatial management."

It also extends previous work on interactive data visualizations in museums to encompass an element of active contribution to scientific data.  To achieve these goals, this project will develop and research U!Scientist (pronounced `You, Scientist!')--a novel approach to using citizen science and learning research-based technology to engage museum visitors in learning about the process of science, shaping attitudes towards science, and science identity development. Through the U!Scientist multi-touch tabletop exhibit, visitors will: (1) interact with scientific data, (2) provide interpretations of data for direct use by scientists, (3) make statements based on evidence, and (4) visualize how their data classifications contribute to globe-spanning research projects. Visitors will also get to experience the process of science, gaining efficacy and confidence through these carefully designed interactions. This project brings together Zooniverse, experts in interactive design and learning based on large data visualizations in museums, and leaders in visitor experience and learning in science museums. Over fifty thousand museum visitors are expected to interact annually with U!Scientist through this effort. This impact will be multiplied by packaging the open-source platform so that others can easily instantiate U!Scientist at their institution. <br/><br/>The U!Scientist exhibit development process will follow rapid iterations of design, implementation, and revision driven by evaluation of experiences with museum visitors. It will involve close collaboration between specialists in computer science, human-computer interaction and educational design, informal science learning experts, and museum practitioners.

Three key questions will be addressed through this effort: Q1) Will visitors participate in PPSR activities (via the U!Scientist touch table exhibit) on the museum floor, despite all the distractions and other learning opportunities competing for their attention? If so, who engages, for how long, and in what group configurations? Q2) If visitors do participate, will they re-engage with the content after the museum visit (i.e., continue on to Zooniverse.org)? Q3) Does engaging in PPSR via the touch table exhibit--with or without continued engagement in Zooniverse.org after the museum visit--lead to learning gains, improved understanding of the nature of science, improved attitudes towards science, and/or science identity development?"

Scientists are increasingly interested in how such changes in the abundance of one species can impact other species, particularly those that eat species that become rare.  Some scientists think that the rareness of one species leads to the rareness of other species that rely on this species, potentially causing a lot of local extinctions -- perhaps even the collapse of an entire ecosystem.   Other scientists disagree.  They think that declines in one species can benefit other species if the first species might compete with the second, leading to a stable ecosystem in which there is an overall balance in the number of species that are increasing relative to those that are decreasing.  Key to predicting the vulnerability of plants and animals to changes in their environment is figuring out which of these opposing views is most likely.  Such understanding will help managers, policy makers and scientists develop strategies to support the diversity of life on earth. The goal of this project is to test how a coastal ecosystem responds to disturbances and, in particular, whether a top predator can adjust to changes in the abundance in its prey.<br/><br/>This research uses a predatory whelk on the Oregon coast to examine how different possible foraging strategies of generalist predators influence the stability of rocky intertidal communities. The researchers will use whelks trained on different prey in the laboratory to replicate different methods of generalist foraging in the field (e.g., constant prey preferences and adaptive foraging). The whelks will be exposed to two natural pulse recruitment perturbations in the field.  Researchers will use the changes in species densities following the perturbations to determine the resilience and resistance of the communities. This will allow the researchers to examine the role that generalists play in promoting community stability and what forms of generalist foraging are the most likely to stabilize communities. This study will support the training of a graduate and undergraduate students and will provide opportunities for outreach through the development of an exhibit for a science center that explains the concept of food webs and how food webs influence the everyday lives of visitors to the science center."

Guiding light via topological protection is particularly exciting due to its economic and scientific importance.  Theoretical descriptions of topologically protected modes often use non-standard forms of topology, described in terms of matrix models.  The project aims to develop the theory of matrix models, and the broader theoretical subject of operator algebras, in ways that are inspired by the advances in physics.  It also intends to make knowledge from the area of operator algebras available to physicists in the form of algorithms and formulas applicable to light waves and electronic waves.  The project aims to develop an unusually direct connection between this work in mathematical analysis and current research on graphene-based electronics and silicon-based photonics.  However, the emphasis will be on a theory of matrix models with symmetries that is robust enough to work equally well with various types of systems, and on advances in matrix theory that will support future applications and future theoretical work in the area of analysis known as noncommutative topology.  <br/><br/>Models of free fermionic systems that allow hopping within a manifold can be naturally formed into a group that is abstractly isomorphic to more standard groups associated to a manifold.  This suggests that there is a reformulation of the common homology theories used in operator algebras.  Central to this project will be finding such a computable reformulation of homology theories for the whole categories of operator algebras that have zero, one, or two added symmetries.  There is now a need for numerical algorithms to analyze many of these matrix models quickly.  Although the classical matrix invariants from geometry can be dealt with by hand calculations for small problems, physicists now require calculation of these invariants on multitudes of large matrices.  Progress in such calculations can be enhanced by improved mathematical understanding of these invariants.  For example, researchers in driven photonic systems use the Bott invariant for almost commuting unitary matrices, which is on good theoretical grounds.  However, there is a related invariant, based on the emergent topology of a matrix model, that can be computed by a much faster algorithm.  This invariant will be studied, with a goal of putting it in a better theoretical context.  The emergent topology of condensed matter and other physical systems will also be used to enhance visualization of the structure of matrix models."

Existing generators of terahertz radiation have significant deficiencies that severely limit their usefulness. These generators either work at temperatures below room temperature or are based on expensive and bulky laser systems. The goal of this project is to create a new type of terahertz generator that is compact, inexpensive and works at room temperature. These generators are based on readily available magnetic materials such as iron oxide and nickel oxide and will operate via conversion of magnetic oscillations in these materials into terahertz electromagnetic waves. The goal of the proposed research program will be achieved via a collaborative effort of a synergistic team of experts in magnetic device fabrication (University of California, Irvine) and leading theorists in the field of magnetic devices (Oakland University).   The results of the proposed research program will impact society in multiple ways. The new method of terahertz signal generation will help maintain the US leadership in terahertz technology. A number of undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in modern device fabrication techniques, which will enhance the US nanotechnology workforce. The outreach activities, including demonstrations on magnetism and superconductivity, will target middle school students from underrepresented groups, and will help attract minorities to science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research program is based on a substantial preliminary experimental and theoretical work of the proposers, who experimentally demonstrated spin pumping in Pt/hematite bi-layers, and theoretically predicted that a bi-layer of a heavy metal (Pt) and an antiferromagnetic material with strong easy-plane and weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropies can function as a source of coherent THz radiation when direct current is applied to the Pt layer. In such antiferromagnet-based auto-oscillators, an electric current in the Pt layer injects pure spin Hall current into the antiferromagnet and drives its order parameter into a state of persistent precession. This precession excited by the component of spin current perpendicular to the easy plane anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is non-uniform in time due to the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy present within the easy plane anisotropy. The frequency of the antiferromagnetic order parameter oscillations is proportional to the injected spin current, and increases from approximately 0.1 THz to 2.0 THz with increasing current density in the Pt layer. The order parameter oscillations are converted into a THz electromagnetic signal with electric field amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm via spin pumping and the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pt layer. The dynamics of the THz-frequency room-temperature antiferromagnetic auto-oscillator is mathematically equivalent to that of a Josephson junction auto-oscillator, with the energy of the weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the antiferromagnet playing the role of the Josephson energy. The demonstration of these compact, tunable and structurally simple antiferromagnet-based sources of THz radiation will enable the development of compact and inexpensive solid state THz devices for imaging, chemical detection, wireless chip-to-chip communication and THz spectroscopy/microscopy."

First, organized heterogeneous information networks (hence called StructNet) are constructed, and then powerful mining mechanisms on such organized networks are developed.  With a focus on biomedical sciences, the project investigates the principles, methodologies and algorithms for (i) construction of relatively structured heterogeneous information networks (called MediNet) by mining biomedical research corpora via attribute extraction, relation typing, and claim mining, and (ii) exploration and mining of the networks so constructed via graph OLAP and task-guided embedding. The project develops an extensible framework to facilitate literature-based scientific research. The study on construction and exploration of MediNet not only impacts biomedical research but also consolidates this data-to-network-to knowledge methodology, readily to be transferred to other domains,  for automatic transformation of massive unstructured text data in those domains into structured and actionable knowledge."

Fraser of the University of Virginia is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the luminescent (light emitting) properties of materials based on difluoroboron beta-diketonates, a family of organic responsive dyes. The many different ways by which these dyes respond to changes in their environment in solution, organized media and the solid state are being investigated.  These responsive dye materials change color when scratched, crushed or smeared, and can self-erase with time. As such, they can find use as sensors, optical memory materials, security inks, intelligence contexts, pigments for art and other products.  Students from diverse backgrounds obtain multifaceted training in a multidisciplinary environment, engage with a network of local, national and international collaborators and learn science communication skills. Outreach towards K-12 schools is established through ties to a local high school science teacher.  An interdisciplinary ""Real World Chemistry Lab"" is under development to engage students, faculty and the community in chemistry and materials related issues relevant to society.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to explore responsive properties of difluoroboron beta-diketonate and bdk dyes in different environments and to consider ways to harness these properties for applications. Informed by computation, this is accomplished by preparing material sets designed to modulate luminescence properties in solution, nanoscale lipid assemblies and molecular solids. Dyes with donor-acceptor substituents, molecular rotors, lipids and other organizing groups are synthesized. Optical properties (emission, lifetime, quantum yield, ultrafast photoluminescence decay) are measured in solution and compared to computed spectra and frontier molecular orbitals. Solvatochromic and viscochromic effects are probed, relevant to investigations with liposomes, membranes and mechanistic probe development. Aggregation induced emission studies characterize the transition from solution to the solid state, whereas dye/polymer blends probe solid-state solvatochromism (dielectric, polar dopants, dye-dye interactions), rigidochromic effects (polymer glass transition temperature, crystallinity), and ML mechanisms, and are readily processable for potential uses. Powder and single crystal XRD provide information about order, dye-dye interactions, and molecular structure, whereas AFM reveals crystallinity and thin film morphologies in molecular solids. Dye assemblies are modeled computationally. Super cooled liquids are investigated by DSC, and mechanochromic properties of dyes are studied for thin films on weigh paper and glass along with new substrates with promising behaviors. A laptop/RGB camera imaging system will characterize dynamic optical effects such as ML recovery, supercooled liquid crystallization, and other luminescence changes in films and assemblies. The expected outcomes of this research are greater fundamental understanding of boron and diketone dye properties in solution, organized lipid media and the solid state. This will lead to more rational design of stimuli responsive, luminescent boron and diketone materials for imaging, sensing and detection applications."

Crisis mortality was important in the past and still has the potential to powerfully shape human demography and biological variation. Anthropological work on past mortality crises has not yet fully clarified the factors that created vulnerability to mortality during different crisis events and the longer-term consequences of demographic crises. Using large skeletal samples from medieval England, Dr. Sharon DeWitte (University of South Carolina), in collaboration with Dr. Julia Beaumont (University of Bradford, UK) and Dr. Janet Montgomery (Durham University, UK), will integrate paleodemographic and isotope analyses to examine temporal changes in diet and migration at the time of the 14th-century Black Death and the interactions among diet, migration, demography, health, sex, and socioeconomic status in the context of the medieval mortality crises of famine and plague. This project will highlight the cultural and social factors that affect crisis events and their outcomes. The results of this project can aid predictions about what might happen in future demographic crises. Clarifying the wider social and economic contexts of mortality crises contributes to the development of policies that can reduce their occurrence and effects. The Black Death and its context provide fascinating examples that capture the public attention and imagination, which can be leveraged to produce positive change. By revealing what happened at the time of the Black Death, this project can motivate action in the face of crises today. Such action might include increased spending on disease research, and efforts to reduce disparities in access to food, medical care, and other resources that affect vulnerability to and mortality during crises.<br/><br/>Clarifying how dietary resources were distributed in the medieval period will allow for an examination of the ways in which general resource availability in a population does not necessarily translate into widespread benefits in the face of socially-, economically-, or politically-prescribed patterns of access to those resources. This project will also contribute to an understanding of long-term changes in migration in the context of disaster and particularly the health consequences thereof. This project will be done using over 2400 skeletons from medieval England using hazards-analysis based approaches in combination with isotope data to achieve the following objectives: 1) determine whether diet improved significantly for different segments of society following the Black Death; 2) examine the effect of migrant status on risk of death during the Black Death and determine whether patterns of migration or the health of migrants changed following the Black Death; 3) determine the factors that affected risks of medieval famine mortality; and 4) determine whether the experience of famine substantially affected risks of mortality during the Black Death, other medieval famines, and under conditions of normal medieval mortality.<br/><br/>This proposal is awarded under the SBE-RCUK Lead Agency Agreement."

Indeed, the idea that owning a house confers enormous benefits on poor families, and that mortgages are the best way to do this, has become a central assumption in poverty-reduction strategies the world over. And yet, the 2007-2008 financial crisis in the United States crucially questioned whether homeownership was reliably a worthwhile goal for low-income families, who disproportionately suffered and lost in the crisis. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores the extent to which homeownership is effective in breaking the cycle of poverty, and in what exact terms, is fundamental to the construction of effective policies that truly promote socioeconomic wellbeing. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, findings will be disseminated to organizations and individuals exploring what factors promote or hinder families' ability to harness homeownership to break the cycle of poverty.<br/><br/>Ins Escobar Gonzalez, under the supervision of Dr. Stephan Palmi of the University of Chicago, explores what socioeconomic and cultural factors contribute to the success or failure of mortgage-based homeownership initiatives. The research will be conducted in Tlajomulco de Ziga, a municipality in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara in western Mexico. This is a particularly apt research setting because, since 2001, it has been the site of a government program that dramatically expanded mortgage-based homeownership rates amongst a diverse pool of lower-income families, resulting in various levels of case-based success. Therefore, the research setting will allow for a precise comparative study into the exact ways mortgages and mortgage-based homeownership are impacting the lives of different kinds of lower-income families, all while assessing the crucial explanatory variables that define people's ability to make and maintain assets. Based on a strategic comparative sample, the investigators will construct 36 case studies that comprise contrasting household structures, employment profiles, and income and asset histories, thus elucidating how different families are processually enabled and constrained by mortgage-based homeownership. The project will contribute to anthropological discussions about neoliberalism, economic anthropological debates about value and moral economies, and cross-disciplinary research on the relationship between debt, sociality, and property."

The report states that the ""accumulated costs to the individual, the family, and the community are staggering and arise as a consequence of many direct and indirect effects, including compromised physical and mental health, increased spread of infectious disease, loss of productivity, reduced quality of life, increased crime and violence, increased motor vehicle crashes, abuse and neglect of children, and health care costs.""

This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will address operational methods to understand and mitigate multiple interrelated opioid addiction epidemics.  The methods will be developed and evaluated with ongoing feedback from an advisory group of policy makers, including state health departments serving multiple urban and rural populations.  The potential impact of these new methods includes improved prevention strategies and support for effective allocation of resources between treatment and interdiction.

The model(s) developed will combine approaches based on differential equations, cellular automata, stochastic processes and will incorporate different geographic and social network topologies, account for regional and population heterogeneity, and capture behavioral characteristics that influence dynamics of disease spread.  An important aspect of these models is the explicit consideration of the inter-relationships between multiple disease modalities, including such factors as substance availability, addiction progression, drug switching and substitutability, variable drug potency, and market (price/supply/demand) forces.  The models will be developed and validated using data obtained from local and regional public health agencies.  Models will be informed by qualitative ethnographic techniques that describe the dynamics of person-to-person spread and region-to-region spread.  These models will serve as platforms for the assessment of current and future intervention strategies, and are expected to help inform policy makers that oversee resource allocation in state public health departments, treatment centers, social service agencies, and law enforcement agencies."

This project advances a new hypothesis that a small molecule, which plants use to make ethylene, functions itself as a novel plant hormone that impacts plant growth and development, and further investigates how the hormone functions at the molecular level throughout the evolutionary breadth of plants. The project has the potential to transform the plant hormone field by altering existing dogma, by requiring the reevaluation of several decades of ethylene literature and by impacting how future ethylene experiments are carried out. The knowledge gained from this project could contribute to future strategies for modifying crop plants for the benefit of society. The project broadens participation of underrepresented students by providing two to three student internships per year in the lab of the principal investigator. The internships involve partnerships with Howard University (an Historically Black College or University) and Eleanor Roosevelt High School (a local public school in which over 70% of the students are underrepresented minorities). The interns carry out aspects of the project while receiving valuable training in scientific methods, data analysis and communication. The project also provides training and career preparation for two postdoctoral scientists, two graduate students and two University of Maryland undergraduates. To further broaden participation, the principal investigator co-teaches summer research workshops for Howard University undergraduates. <br/><br/>The well-known ethylene precursor in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a non-proteinogenic amino acid. Compelling new data suggest that ACC itself may be an important signaling molecule that evolutionarily predated the ability of higher land plants to efficiently convert ACC to ethylene. In particular, ACC inhibits cellular differentiation and growth in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. This project tests the hypothesis that ACC is a novel plant hormone through analyses of ACC function, including an investigation of ACC signaling mechanisms. Insight into ACC function is provided by studies of ACC synthesis mutants and ACC responses in Marchantia, and in evolutionarily relevant species in the plant lineage (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Spirogyra pratensis, Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis thaliana), thus addressing the conservation of ACC function, while taking advantage of lower gene copy number in basal plants. In Arabidopsis, preliminary findings indicate that ACC can induce pollen tube growth concomitant with Ca2+ influx and can stimulate primary root growth. ACC activates Ca2+ currents in Arabidopsis root protoplasts, and notably, this activation is dependent on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) ionotropic channels. The project tests the hypothesis that ACC is a GLR ligand using a combination of molecular genetics, patch-clamping, ion-specific vibrating probes and live imaging of Ca2+. Genetic evidence is sought based on phenotypic comparisons of glr mutants and ACC synthesis mutants in the range of plant species. The activation of GLRs by ACC, leading to the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in pollen tube growth and/or root growth, would be a breakthrough in understanding mechanisms of ACC signaling, as well as GLR signaling, and would represent a ligand-operated system of Ca2+ regulation for which no consensual system currently exists in plants. The striking ACC response uncovered in Marchantia provides for a genetic screen for ACC signaling mutants, followed by gene cloning based on T-DNA tagging or whole genome sequencing."

Its absolute zero resistivity promises the future of clean energy transmission and magnetically-levitated transportation without friction. Superconductivity has been challenging the scientific community for three decades. Unlike in simple metals, where electrons move freely, in unconventional superconductors they are mostly confined in two dimensional planes. This restriction, together with their mutual stronger interaction, create a ""traffic jam"" of electrons. Externally, altering the number of the electrons leads to various novel states of matter, such as superconductivity and exotic electronic patterns. It remains unclear whether these different electronic states coexist or compete. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, an experimental technique that locally visualizes the electrons, and resonant x-ray scattering, an experimental probe of global electronic states, the research team aims to investigate how these electronic states emerge in various correlated material systems. An important question to be answered is how external tuning can locally destroy one ordered state and enhance another. The project is designed to advance our fundamental understanding of superconductivity and provide means for enhancing their transition temperatures. Educational goals result from this research through outreach activities utilizing the principle investigator's research tools that will amaze and inspire K-12 students with live-demonstrations and hands-on experimentations as well as provide explicit education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Identifying broken symmetry states near quantum phase transitions remains a key objective of strongly correlated electron systems. A challenging goal is the microscopic understanding of emergent superconductivity. Central to this challenge is the local coexistence of various electronic states, such as nematic, charge, and orbital ordering that preempt, promote, or are intertwined with superconductivity. Probing and visualizing the microscopic origin of these ordered states and deliberately tuning them is the key objective towards understanding and controlling superconductivity. The research program aims to visualize and tune broken symmetry states in d- and f-correlated electron systems near quantum phase transitions. The research team uses a new approach that enables to uniaxially strain these material systems and visualize their response in the electronic density of states through spectroscopic imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope and resonant x-ray scattering. The research program's goal is to discover and understand novel phases of matter in correlated material systems that may promote, enhance, or twist superconductivity. Natural broader impacts result from this research through outreach activities that aim to amaze and inspire K-12 students. Some of these activities involve live demonstrations and hands-on experimentations, such as cryogenic cooling, superconducting levitation and transportation to be performed at the Greater Binghamton Soccer Dome, the Kopernik Observatory & Science Center, and local elementary schools. A graduate level course on experimental techniques in condensed matter is developed by the principle investigator that provides explicit education and training for undergraduate and graduate students."

Large portions of the United States, from Alaska to California and eastward to the New Madrid Seismic Zone and coastal South Carolina and north to the St. Lawrence Seaway, are prone to the impacts from earthquakes.  Earthquakes such as those in New Zealand and others have raised awareness about limitations in our understanding of the cyclic response of natural soil deposits.  These limitations have arisen through continued use of the traditional practice of simplifying geotechnical analyses by considering two main soil types: drained sands and undrained clays.  Design methodologies for nearly all geotechnical systems have developed along these two distinct lines.  However, many natural soil deposits do not fit into these simple categories; transitional silty soils, the subject of this research, are an example.  This study aims to answer pertinent questions concerning the cyclic response of transitional silty soils through systematic and coordinated field and laboratory studies that will improve our understanding of the potential for large deformations and loss of life and property during large earthquakes.  The findings of this research will have broad application across the nation and globe.  Furthermore, this research will have a parallel objective of inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders.  Collaboration with the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon will allow our outreach efforts to reach 150,000 visitors and 40,000 K-12 students and teachers per year, through: (1) public demonstrations of liquefaction and in-situ cyclic tests with a large mobile shaker truck, (2) a compilation of video demonstrations, data, and interviews with the researchers into a permanent interactive exhibit, and (3) development of instructional modules for HMSC staff to help their established outreach effort expand instruction to include coastal hazards such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone and associated tsunami.  The demonstrations will be leveraged to form permanent exhibits and instructional modules, which will greatly extend this outreach effort.<br/><br/>This research will improve our understanding of the in-situ and laboratory cyclic response of silt soils including nonlinearity, degradation of stiffness, triggering of destabilizing excess pore pressures, and the corresponding post-shaking consequences.  Specifically, this study will: (1) narrow the threshold fines content and plasticity separating ""sand-like"" and ""clay-like"" responses to cyclic shear stresses/strains and identify critical threshold states; (2) compare the in-situ, uniaxial and biaxial cyclic response of transitional soils to understand how changes in strong ground motion directionality impacts generation of pore pressure and volumetric strain; (3) determine the effect of soil fabric, stress history, and degree of saturation on the cyclic and post-cyclic response of transitional soils; (4) link the regional findings from this work to previous efforts on transitional soils; and (5) inspire future seismologists, geologists, earthquake engineers, and natural hazard and resilience planners through a long-lived, coordinated outreach program.  This work concentrates on experiments that target small-to-large shear strains, using techniques that range from in-situ cyclic loading from large mobile shakers and blast liquefaction, to specialized and coordinated laboratory tests, allowing the development of an unprecedented dataset critical for improving the understanding of the in-situ and elemental level cyclic response to be bridged."

Often individual tools are used without much guidance on how they fit in the big picture, and questions about best practices abound in online forums. However, existing answers are typically generic rules of thumb or dated advice, mostly based on third-party experiences, often non-applicable to the specific context.

State-of-the-art decision-making support, based on hard data and informed advice, can help DevOps engineers discern the best choices and practices for their tasks.<br/><br/>The proposed research is grounded in contingency theory, where the emphasis is on task context when reasoning about the effectiveness of practices. The goal of this project is to learn and convey structured, context-dependent analytics on best practices in DevOps environments, by mining and analyzing data from the collaborative coding platform GitHub. Using established and novel qualitative and quantitative techniques, this research will: (1) identify clusters of software projects that share similar context variables; and (2) within a context of interest, discern the conditions under which DevOps practices such as continuous integration are most (and least) effective.

This project systematically measures the influence of molecular shape and the strength of intermolecular interactions on the kinetics of crystal growth to investigate molecular level control of the mechanism of melt crystallization.  In addition to advancing the fundamental science, this work is invaluable to all fields of science for which crystal growth is critical, such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, food products, geology, and atmospheric science.

Experimental measurement of the crystallization kinetics of oligoacenes and alkylammonium metal halide salts, as a function of the number of aromatic rings and length of alkyl chains, respectively, is being used to probe the impact of molecular anisotropy and crystal dimensionality on the rate of crystallization. Comparative kinetic measurements from isotropic vs. oriented melts of liquid crystals is utilized to articulate the impact of molecular pre-orientation on the rate of crystallization. Also, the crystallization kinetics across the family of substituted benzenes creates a geometric and energetic matrix with which to evaluate functional group effects.  The PI's recent discovery of Transition Zone Theory, the condensed matter analog of Eyring's transition state theory, enables for the identification of entropic and enthalpic activation parameters of crystallization reactions. This award facilitates a continuing offering of the summer teacher workshops, and also supports hiring a high school chemistry teacher to work with the PI during summers to write and publish components of this professional development, which affords greater dissemination of the problem-solving/discovery based materials."

The project will compare a cohort of teachers who participated in STEM research as part of their teacher training (teacher-researchers) with a comparison group of teachers who have been similarly prepared but have limited research backgrounds. Approximately half of the teacher-researchers involved in this study were also Noyce Scholars, who have committed to teaching in high-need settings. The findings of this study may lead to improved STEM education and educator development by demonstrating the impacts of research experiences for pre-service teachers. Findings will also inform research partnerships involving academia, industry, and federal agencies. Finally, the ultimate measure of any teacher research experience is the impact on the students of the teacher-researcher. This study will examine the extent to which teacher-researchers effectively engage their students in science, engineering, and mathematical practices and prepare their students for STEM careers. <br/><br/>The treatment group in this quasi-experimental, comparative study will involve 303 individuals (including 175 Noyce Scholars) who participated for one to three years in a pre-service teacher-researcher program in partnerships with national research laboratories from 2010-2014. This group will be compared with Noyce Scholars and other teacher candidates who applied to but did not participate in research. The project will also focus on a subset of 159 treatment-group participants (including 51 Noyce Scholars) from four higher education institutions. This subsample will be compared with other Noyce Scholars and teacher candidates prepared by the same institutions, but with limited research experience. To measure impacts on persistence and retention, the study will investigate career trajectories of the treatment and comparison groups. Informed by this work, the project will conduct additional data collection in four high-need local educational agencies with high numbers of treatment group participants to identify matched comparison teachers within their schools. Additional data collected from these selected districts will include teacher and principal/supervisor interviews along with K-12 student surveys and data from student achievement assessments aligned with state standards. Controlling for academic and demographic variables, teacher preparation, and local school and district characteristics, the study will inform how teacher effectiveness, retention, and persistence are impacted by enrichment of the Noyce Scholar experience through summer research.

However, the way charges move through these materials can be complex due to their disordered nature or sensitivity to their environment.  The better one understands charge motion in these materials and at their interfaces, the better one can devise materials for applications such as solar cells, efficient lighting and electronic devices.  Given their disordered nature, full characterization of these materials must be done with nanoscale resolution.  Furthermore, it is possible to use an atomic force microscope - a tool that enables imaging of materials on the nanoscale - to visualize charge motion through these materials in real time. This project harnesses an atomic force microscope to develop a technique for accurate probing of charge motion through a variety of non-traditional semiconductors.  This technique can provide insights into material behavior by following real-time charge motion at different points in response to changing conditions. The female undergraduate students from Mount Holyoke College are involved in every part of the research.  Women are severely underrepresented in physics and engineering - fewer than 25% of the bachelor's degrees are granted to women in physics - and early involvement in research encourages persistence in the major.  To promote public engagement with science, the PI organizes and hosts a monthly SciTech Caf open to the public, where participants discuss scientific topics with researchers in an informal setting.   <br/><br/>Technical description: This proposal develops a scanning probe technique that records real-time charge motion in thin films in response to a changing electric field, applying the technique to non-traditional semiconductors.  These materials show complex transport behavior, often due to their disorder or sensitivity to the environment.  The morphological non-uniformity within many of these materials and the importance of interfaces necessitates characterization tools that provide spatial resolution, while the time dependence on long and short timescales requires time resolution.  Time-resolved point Kelvin probe force microscopy records the potential of the thin film at a point as it evolves in time after the application of a gate voltage, as charges are injected or extracted from the film to screen the gate potential.  This real-time screening behavior permits characterization of the carrier traps, critical for understanding hysteresis in devices and in predicting and understanding open circuit voltage in solar cells.  The spatial resolution enables discrimination among contributions to the observed transport behavior.  Studying well characterized organic semiconductors is used to validate the technique before investigating colloidal quantum dot thin films and monolayers of molybdenum disulfide.  The project is conducted at Mount Holyoke College, with the female undergraduate student body participating in all aspects of the research.  The project also supports SciTech Caf, which brings scientists into an informal setting to share their excitement about their work with the general public.

Glasses are ubiquitous in nature, and many of them have superior properties (much better than crystals) that can be utilized for important applications. For example, metallic glasses (MGs) are multi-component metallic alloys with glassy (disordered) atomic structure, and their excellent properties, including high strength and elastic energy, have shown great promises for novel structural applications. However, such applications are currently limited by the poor ductility of MGs. To understand the deformation behavior of MGs, it is required to understand their atomic structure and how structural heterogeneities at different length scales influence the way they plastically deform. Using a unique combination of advanced electron microscopy and mesoscale computer simulation, the PIs will investigate how the local atomic ordering that is inherited from processing of the MGs affects their important mechanical properties, and seek opportunities to improve MG ductility by engineering structural heterogeneities at the nanoscale through adjusting alloy composition and heat treatment. The PIs will use electron microscopy techniques for the educational component of this award to introduce science and engineering of MGs to K12 students and teachers, including students with disabilities, and to motivate them to choose science and engineering as their college major and to pursue their careers in these fields.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This award supports an integrated experimental and computational study of the correlation between nanoscale structural heterogeneities and deformation behavior of metallic glasses (MGs). In particular, the PIs will use nanodiffraction combined with two advanced analysis methods (fluctuation microscopy and angular correlation function) to reveal the details of medium range (nanoscale) atomic orders (MROs) in MGs, including their type, size, volume fraction, and distribution, at an unprecedented quantitative level. These structural details will be characterized as function of composition and thermal history of the MGs and correlated to their deformation behavior. The PIs will then incorporate the experimentally determined MRO information into mesoscale computer simulations based on a heterogeneously randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) model to establish new understanding on how the MROs affect shear banding and overall deformation. The possible connection between MRO and STZs will be investigated by first assuming a set of deformation rules in the simulations according to the detailed MRO structures revealed by the nanodiffraction, and then matching the simulation results (including overall ductility and shear banding patterns) to the experimental observations. Such a fully integrated experimental and computational study will provide important insights into how the nanoscale structural heterogeneity affects STZ activation and the overall deformation. <br/>Through this award the PIs will probe nanoscale structural heterogeneities in MGs beyond the limits of the conventional characterization methods, and reveal important connections among composition, thermal history, MRO, and mechanical properties. Simulations incorporating the experimentally determined structural heterogeneity will offer new insights into how structural heterogeneities at the nanoscale in MGs affect their overall deformation behavior beyond the spatial and temporal limits of previous simulations. This award will also provide insights into how the nanoscale structural heterogeneity is related to the previously suggested plasticity carriers and structural defects in MGs, such as STZ, free volume distribution, and the recently suggested geometrically unfavored motifs. The new structure-property relationship established will provide new possibilities in designing MGs with enhanced mechanical properties (in particular, ductility) by tuning the nanoscale structural heterogeneities."

The intellectual merits of this project are to develop theory, algorithms, and implementation for robust and scalable network-based machine learning and data mining techniques in high-dimensional gene expression and gene mutation data for disease subtype discovery in cancer. The results of the project can help to identify individual cancer, pan-cancer, and sex-specific subtypes to better understand the nature of cancer and to develop the most efficacious therapeutic strategies.

Today, most computer hardware executes programs in a non-deterministic fashion: a program may yield different output or behavior in different runs, given the exact same input, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Recent research enforces deterministic execution in inherently non-deterministic systems. Unfortunately, this often comes at a steep performance price. Also, until now determinism is only available for non-interactive programs. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of deterministic execution of concurrent programs, and to include a large class of interactive programs in the scope of deterministic execution. Longer term, the goal is to make deterministic computing a viable choice, where nondeterminism is the only option today. This would likely improve both the safety and quality of the vast number of multithreaded programs running on today's and tomorrow's multicore devices.<br/><br/>To bring the benefits of deterministic execution to real-world programs, this project investigates algorithms, runtime systems, operating systems and hardware support to improve the performance and applicability of determinism. The project is organized along three major thrusts: combating the clock skew in deterministic logical clocks that imposes unnecessary waiting on threads, using speculation to break the serial bottleneck that current systems impose on synchronization operations, and extending the scope of determinism to encompass interactive applications. The researchers plan to openly distribute the systems built for this project to facilitate examination by other researchers and integration with computer systems education."

The principal investigator also plans to apply these tools to study the problem of which high dimensional shapes can be triangulated, that is, decomposed into simple pieces (similar to a decomposition of a surface into triangles). Triangulations have applications beyond pure mathematics, for example in computer graphics. The project also aims to support graduate education and to disseminate mathematical ideas to the general public.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the project concerns Floer theories associated to three-manifolds, and their topological applications. In particular, the principal investigator will investigate Seiberg-Witten Floer stable homotopy types, the associated Pin(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, and involutive Heegaard Floer homology. These theories can be used to get information about the homology cobordism group in three dimensions. In turn, homology cobordism gives insight into the classification of triangulations for manifolds of dimension at least five. The principal investigator also proposes to understand the behavior of Heegaard Floer homology for coverings of 3-manifolds, and to develop 3-manifold invariants from the moduli spaces of SL(2,C) flat connections."

This phenomenon affects both new-comers and seasoned veterans of the differential privacy field because of the difficulty and subtlety of developing new differentially private algorithms.<br/><br/>This proposal outlines a research plan for the development of a system called DevDP, whose purpose is to enable novice and expert users to develop prototypes and explore differentially private algorithms. In particular, the project will develop program analysis tools and theory that leverage both programming language and machine learning technology to aid the development of correct differentially private programs by automating much of the verification and reasoning about errors. As part of broader impacts, DevDP also has the potential to help educate students and less-technical members of the scientific community by providing interactive software tools. A solid understanding of differential privacy will become crucial as it makes its way into public policy."

The fraction of thermal energy is significant, because sunlight-excited electrons transfer some of their excess energy into vibrations in the material's crystal. To improve the performance of solar cells, researchers seek a new class of materials in which sunlight-excited electrons transfer excess energy to other electrons, rather than to vibrations in the crystal lattice. Semiconducting carbon nanotubes are a promising material for this new generation of solar cell design. The electrons in carbon nanotubes interact very strongly with each other, suggesting that energy can be efficiently transferred from one electron to another. This research project addresses the challenge of optimizing a photovoltaic device to understand the physics of strongly interacting electrons in these materials. The project has a public-engagement component, with the PI working as a Science Communication Fellow associated with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and leading the physics outreach team at Oregon State University. The project includes summer research experience for young scientists from under-represented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Description: In low-dimensional materials, Coulomb interactions between charge carriers are enhanced, thereby enhancing the phenomena of carrier multiplication. Carrier multiplication can increase the energy conversion efficiency of solar cell devices because multiple electron-hole pairs can be excited by a single photon when photon energy exceeds twice the band gap. Previous experiments on zero-dimensional quantum dots have shown that carrier extraction is a major obstacle to harnessing carrier multiplication. This project focuses on carrier multiplication in a semiconducting carbon nanotube, a one-dimensional system in which carriers can be efficiently extracted. The experiments utilize individual carbon nanotube pn junctions to reveal the effect of temperature, electric field, and dielectric screening on the carrier multiplication process. The research addresses the exciton dissociation mechanism, carrier multiplication efficiency, and the fundamental limits of photocurrent quantum yield in semiconducting carbon nanotubes. By furthering our understanding of carrier multiplication in a strongly-interacting electronic system, the project supports the development of solar cell devices that beat the Schockley-Queisser limit."

Haskell is used by researchers and programmers in industry to build a variety of software  systems, such as financial analysis tools, interactive websites, data visualizations, and automated vehicle software. Dependent types are an up-and-coming technology that allows programmers to avoid bugs in their software, allowing them to include mathematical proofs of correctness in their code. These proofs are checked before the software ever runs, ruling out the possibility of failures, such as a crashed website. The intellectual merits are insights into the integration of advanced mathematical theories with an industrial-strength development tool (Haskell) and a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles that underlie the creation of correct software. The project's broader significance and importance are to give the technology industry access to dependent types for the first time, while creating opportunities for students (including those at one principal investigator's undergraduate women's college) to engage with this technology.<br/><br/>The project includes both practical and foundational components. The  Haskell type system, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 8.0, is able to simulate dependent types through the use of many language extensions. However, this use requires awkward encodings, and the extensions that support them complicate the language. In contrast, the Haskell type system envisioned by this project is based on a uniform approach to dependently typed programming that subsumes prior extensions. Part of this project involves replacing the core language of GHC with one based on dependent type theory, using relevance annotations to ensure that these extensions are backwards compatible. Furthermore, the project also introduces matchable functions, a qualifier that determines whether function applications can be analyzed via pattern matching, enabling the integration of dependent types with GHC's current type inference algorithm.  Finally, this project includes an examination of the semantics of dependently typed programming languages with partiality."

Algebraic topology associates algebraic invariants to spaces, moving the problem of understanding spaces (up to continuous deformation), to the more tractable world of algebra. At the heart of this project is the problem of understanding some of these invariants when the space in question is considered with the additional data of its symmetries. For example, instead of just considering a sphere, we can try to build in the additional data of the symmetry which maps each point to its antipodal point; or instead of considering a plane, we can consider a plane together with all the rigid motions of the plane that fix a square centered at its origin. The particular invariants considered in this project are algebraic K-theory and A-theory: deep invariants that have very significant connections to problems in number theory and geometry. Their versatility, however, requires sophisticated topological and categorical constructions. Part of this project is concerned with completing some necessary foundational work that allows these constructions to encode the extra data of symmetries, and part of it is concerned with using newly developed tools to rigorously define and study these theories, while keeping track of symmetries. There is also an educational component to the proposal-the PI plans to start a Directed Reading Program at the Johns Hopkins University, modeled on the one at the University of Chicago. The goal is to provide mentorship to undergraduates by pairing them with graduate students for reading courses, and in the process encourage interested students to pursue graduate work in mathematics.<br/><br/>Building on the PI's previous work on equivariant algebraic K-theory, the PI will develop an equivariant version of A-theory that is related to equivariant pseudo-isotopies and h-cobordisms of G-manifolds. Th project fits into a long-term research program of the project team aimed at establishing a chain of homotopy-theoretic constructions that relate the geometric behavior of compact G-manifolds to that of their underlying equivariant homotopy types. In current work, the project team has defined an equivariant A-theory spectrum, and the next step is to show that it fits into an equivariant stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem. In a related project with collaborators, the PI plans to study an equivariant version of the additivity theorem for Waldhausen G-categories. Nonequivariantly, K-theory is universal with respect to the additivity theorem, and equivariantly one can hope for a similar characterization. Progress has been slow in equivariant K and A-theory partly because adequate foundations were not in place. Equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery which turns suitable categories with G-action into G-spectra, has seen a lot of development in the last few years, and, motivated by the need for a solid foundation for equivariant algebraic K and A-theory, the PI, together with collaborators, is completing a series of projects on equivariant infinite loop space theory. This work not only produces new results (some of which have been anticipated for about 35 years), but they also consolidate work in important areas where the literature is fragmented and in need of clarification. They should provide some of the tools for the projects proposed above, as well as some related ones. In a different direction, the PI and collaborators have defined and are studying a spectral character map that generalizes the classical character map from representation theory. Lastly, the PI plans to study motivic Galois extensions."

For example, in cancer research it is common to use multiple high-throughput technology platforms to measure genotype, gene expression levels, and methylation levels. One of the main challenges in the analysis of such data is the identification of key biological measurements that can be used to classify the subject into a known cancer subtype.  While significant progress has been made in the development of computationally efficient classification methods to address this challenge, existing methods do not adequately take into account the heterogeneity across the cancer subtypes and the mixed types of measurements (binary/count/continuous) across technology platforms.  As such, existing methods may fail to identify relevant biological patterns. The goal of this project is to develop new classification methods that explicitly take into account the type and heterogeneity of measurements. While the primary focus is on methodology, high priority will be given to computational considerations and software development to encourage dissemination and ensure ease of use for domain scientists.  <br/><br/>Regularized linear discriminant methods are commonly used for simultaneous classification and variable selection due to their interpretability and computational efficiency. These methods, however, rely on unrealistic assumptions of equality of group-covariance matrices and normality of measurements. This project aims to address the limitations present in current discriminant approaches, and has three objectives: (1) to develop computationally efficient quadratic classification rules that perform variable selection; (2) to generalize the discriminant analysis framework to non-normal measurements; (3) to develop a classification framework for mixed type data coming from multiple technology platforms collected on the same set of subjects. The key methodological innovation is the combination of sparse low-rank singular value decomposition, which enables computational efficiency, with geometric interpretation of linear discriminant analysis, which allows for the construction of nonlinear classification rules by redefining the space for discrimination."

However, a great challenge is identifying the differences in DNA between related varieties of the same crop, which are responsible for the subtle trait variation that plant breeders exploit to improve productivity. A major contributor to this trait variation is 'genome structural variation' where pieces of DNA are deleted, inserted, or rearranged resulting in changes in gene expression. This project will focus on how structural variation contributed to domestication and breeding of tomatoes. A related goal is to expand and develop new molecular tools to create structural variation for crop improvement. This project will improve US agriculture by providing new knowledge and tools to efficiently and predictably enhance crop productivity. A major part of the project will also include training of young scientists in fundamental principles of plant genome research that can be applied to agriculture.  This knowledge will also be shared through outreach programs in inner city New York schools that do not have access to research opportunities. Project personnel will develop hands-on teaching activities that will highlight the importance of plant genomics and new genome editing technologies to improve crops and meet the agricultural needs of the 21st century.<br/><br/><br/>Limited knowledge on the extent and diversity of structural variation in plant genomes is hindering the ability to link genes to important crop phenotypes. This project will unite new long-read sequencing technologies, computational biology, developmental and quantitative genetics, and genome editing to elucidate and manipulate structural variation (SV) at a scale never before achieved for a major crop. Tomato provides a powerful system due to its relatively small and high quality reference genome and availability of resequenced genomes. By applying SV-detection algorithms to existing short-read Illumina sequencing data from hundreds of accessions, more than 40 genomes will be selected, capturing the majority of predicted SV diversity, to establish new reference genomes using the latest long-read sequencing technology (PacBio and 10X Genomics). From these data, a compendium of validated SVs will be generated and integrated with ongoing genome-wide association studies. Significant gene-associated SVs, including those affecting gene activity measured by genome-wide transcript profiling, will be characterized using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and quantitative phenotypic analyses, focusing on reproductive traits that drive crop productivity. In parallel, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will be used to generate a collection of SV mutations in known yield and fruit quality genes in two related wild Solanaceae with agricultural potential, with the goal of achieving major steps towards domestication and for comparative developmental genetics studies. This project will greatly expand our knowledge of genomic diversity in tomato, and provide a road map for dissecting SVs in other crops, where such knowledge can be exploited to improve productivity."

However, we do not know exactly how this happens or particularly, how these different factors work together. In the United States and around the world, marginalized populations find ways to directly or indirectly access mainstream socio-economic resources. In the context of unprecedented global population mobility, there is a need to better understand the negative health and psychosocial impacts of low status, especially with respect to their effects on the economy at large. The research funded by this award will address this problem by examining a case in which people suddenly experience a very sharp reduction in their political and social status, which will allow the researchers to observe the effects more clearly. In addition, the research will test the idea that a person's social support networks moderate the effects of low status on well-being.

Thousands of asylum seekers at Kakuma lose institutional support from the UNHCR and other international non-governmental organizations when their petitions for refugee status are rejected, denying them access to food distribution, healthcare resources, and other services. Those denied refugee status are expected to leave the camp, but most are unable to do so because of prohibitive financial costs and their precarious status as stateless persons. The unfortunate situation provides an important research opportunity to compare the effects of marginality on those who receive official status and those who do not. The researchers will collect data on how both groups obtain resources and how their social and behavioral responses are reflected in their health and physiology. They will employ ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire to assess refugees' perceived wellbeing and integration into the camp's informal economy. They will collect social network data to quantify the size and diversity of social support networks. Body composition (body fat and BMI), blood pressure, and heart rate will be used to provide measures of overall health and nutritional status, while biomarkers of immune function and stress physiology will be assessed from blood and fingernail samples.

This tool will achieve the<br/>following objectives: 1) be portable, easy to use and easy to<br/>understand, 2) have high performance and scalable rendering and<br/>storage techniques and, 3) be applicable to the different<br/>communication fabrics and programming models that are likely to be<br/>used on existing large HPC systems and emerging exascale systems.  The<br/>transformative impact of the proposed research and development effort<br/>is to design a comprehensive analysis and performance monitoring tool<br/>for applications of current and next generation multi<br/>petascale/exascale systems to harness the maximum performance and<br/>scalability.<br/><br/>The proposed research and the associated infrastructure will have a<br/>significant impact on enabling optimizations of HPC and Big Data<br/>applications that have previously been difficult to provide. These<br/>potential outcomes will be demonstrated by using the proposed<br/>framework to validate a variety of HPC and Big Data benchmarks and<br/>applications under multiple scenarios.  The integrated middleware and<br/>tools will be made publicly available to the community through public<br/>repositories and publications in the top forums, enabling other MPI<br/>and Big Data stacks to adopt the designs.  Research results will also<br/>be disseminated to the collaborating organizations of the<br/>investigators to impact their HPC software products and<br/>applications. The proposed research directions and their solutions<br/>will be used in the curriculum of the PIs to train undergraduate and<br/>graduate students, including under-represented minorities and female<br/>students. The technical challenges addressed by the proposal include: 1)<br/>Scalable visualization of large and complex HEC networks so as to<br/>provide a near instant rendering to end users, 2) A generalized data<br/>gathering scheme which is easily portable to multiple communication<br/>fabrics, novel compute architectures and high-performance middleware,<br/>3) Enhanced data storage performance through optimized database<br/>schemas and the use of memory-backed key value stores/databases, 4)<br/>Support in MPI, PGAS, and Big Data libraries to enable the proposed<br/>monitoring, analysis, and introspection framework, and 5) Enabling<br/>deeper introspection of particular regions of application.

In this project, the research team will use a naturally-occurring animal model, the white-throated sparrow, to connect behavior with gene sequence in a concrete way. In this species, 50% of the birds have an unusual chromosome that makes them more aggressive. The chromosome is therefore an excellent tool for understanding how individual variation in gene expression contributes to variation in behavior. The team recently showed that animals with the unusual chromosome have higher expression of a type of steroid receptor in some areas of the brain. Here, the research group determines the genetic mechanisms, at the molecular level, that cause some birds to express more of these receptors than others. In so doing, the team demonstrates how responsiveness to steroid hormones is encoded in the genome. The work lends itself well to education and outreach because it illustrates basic biological concepts in a common backyard bird. Thus, it serves to integrate multiple units of a typical biology course in a way that is accessible to students. High school teachers are recruited to participate in the research and to develop lesson plans about genetics, hormones, brain anatomy, and social behavior. The PI also mentors high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students in the lab. More than 75% of the PI's mentees at Emory have been underrepresented minorities or women. <br/><br/>The evolution of behavior relies on changes at the level of the genome, yet few vertebrate behaviors can be traced directly to genetic sequences. In the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a chromosomal inversion segregates with an aggressive behavioral phenotype, offering a rare opportunity to connect genes and behavior in a concrete way. The inversion has captured the gene ESR1, which encodes estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). The research team recently showed that the local expression of ERalpha in the brain depends on the presence or absence of the inversion and that variation in ERalpha expression predicts the effect of genotype on territorial aggression. The research group uses in vitro reporter assays, bisulfite sequencing, and allele-specific quantitative PCR to identify the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to variation in expression of ERalpha. The effects of selective ERalpha ligands on aggressive behavior in animals of each genotype is used to determine whether variation in ERalpha expression and function is causal for variation in territorial aggression. Because the team uses tissue from behaviorally characterized, free-living animals, the molecular and behavioral levels are integrated in the same animals to allow novel connections. The results provide an interdisciplinary, integrated model of how genetic change leads to phenotypic change. The work lends itself well to education and outreach because it illustrates basic biological concepts in a common backyard bird."

However, the precise mechanism of explosion has not been unambiguously determined, and this fifty-year-old conundrum is one of the central remaining unsolved problems in theoretical astrophysics.  A research team at Princeton University will conduct three-dimensional computer simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the goal of determining the explosion mechanisms, energies, and the morphologies and masses of the residual neutron stars left after the explosion. The three-dimensional models of the core-collapse explosion process will be among the most complete, detailed, and realistic ever performed and will serve as crucial benchmarks for comparisons with observations of supernovae and their products. These simulations produce video products, which the researchers will adapt into talks and displays for the public.<br/><br/>The investigators will conduct three-dimensional radiation/hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae using the newly-developed and published code FORNAX, whichincorporates state-of-the-art microphysics and methodologies.  The research team has found that all their models with realistic physics explode by the neutrino heating mechanism. They will build on this result to further study the effects of many-body corrections to neutrino-nucleon cross sections, pre-collapse seed perturbations, general relativity, and inelastic neutrino-electron and neutrino-nucleon scattering on the supernova explosions. In addition, this proposal supports the experimental nuclear physics program by exploring nucleosynthesis in astrophysical explosions, the properties of the neutrino, and the equation of state and phases of dense nuclear matter.

Large-population games have traditionally been difficult to analyze due to the large size of the system and the game nature of the interaction. The theory of mean field games provides a useful way to approximate these complex systems, and the theory helps to improve understanding of the effects of interactions and how populations react to different compensation schemes or public policies. On the other hand, the 2008 financial crisis revealed the fragility of financial models. Since then, the urge to develop financial theories that take into account model risk has grown tremendously. This research project explores mathematical questions in mean field game theory and robust finance.<br/> <br/>The first part of the project analyzes a dynamic competition involving a large number of players, where the interaction among players is through the ranking of the completion time of their respective projects. The model applies to situations where many firms or individuals compete to be the first to achieve a goal. The objective is to understand the equilibrium and design a reward scheme that encourages early project completion given that the organizer has a limited budget, or to minimize the budget given a desired rate of completion. The second part of the project is concerned with the accuracy of the mean field game approximation, when in many applications, the typical size of competition is only modestly large. The objective is to study the fluctuation around the hydrodynamic limit of the mean field game approximation so as to improve accuracy. The third part of the project studies a mean field game of optimal stopping when the interaction among players is neither through the state process nor the cost structure, at least not in a direct way, but through the belief or information revealed from the action of stopping. The last part of the project considers pricing and hedging of contingent claims in a financial market under both transaction costs and model uncertainty, where model uncertainty is described by a collection of probability measures. In general the collection need not have a reference measure that dominates every other measure, and therefore, standard tools from functional analysis cannot be applied, and new techniques are called for."

Second, the investigator aims to find novel ways of modeling data sets that can take into account new features of modern big data. Finally, the investigator intends to push the boundary of Bayesian computation by inventing new algorithms that are both fast and theoretically sound.

As of October 2016, PFOA has been discovered in unsafe concentrations in the groundwater of Eagle Bridge and Petersburgh, NY, Merrimack, NH, and in Bennington, North Bennington, and Pownal, VT. In response, select science courses at Bennington College and Union College will be redesigned in conversation with this unfolding contamination event. In these courses, undergraduate students will be trained in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies and equipped to apply that training in the production of independent data on a disaster in real-time. The project will craft new curriculum and teaching modules aimed at incorporating local environmental problems into science curriculum, as well as new methods for assessing the educational impact of doing so.  The educational data produced by this project promises to inform and improve existing science curriculum at Bennington College and Union College as well as offer insights about what works in STEM education on a liberal arts campus more generally. This project will also produce key data on changing levels of PFOA in groundwater and regional soils that will provide a much-needed independent characterization of the contamination plume. This project, then, will showcase the civic value of an education in science for diverse undergraduate students and the local community.<br/><br/>The guiding educational research question of this project is: How can environmental research on a local public crisis enhance the STEM curriculum for undergraduate students? Specifically, this project willexamine how training students in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology and equipping them to apply those discipline-based skills to help produce key data on a local crisis will influence student enrollment, fluency, retention, and vocational orientation in STEM fields. The researchers hypothesize that hands-on experience in meaningful environmental research will demonstrate the value of STEM fields in a liberal arts education and enhance student outcomes within STEM for both STEM and non-STEM majors. To evaluate this hypothesis, this project will produce data on changes in student attitudes towards and aptitude in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies while those students participate in environmental research on a nearby water contamination issue. Education assessment scholars will collaborate with project personnel to calibrate proven education assessment tools to this project. These evaluation tools include: pre- and post- assessments of discipline-specific knowledge, reflective prompts in Assessment Tools in Informal Science (ATIS) geared towards measuring students' beliefs about and understandings of science, and the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey. This project will also develop a reflexive infrastructure of assessment designed to monitor the entire learning experience of students in these classes and incorporate preliminary findings into the overall pedagogy of the project.

The research focuses on electrical charge carriers of opposite signs located very close to each other in gallium nitride quantum structures. The carriers of opposite signs maintain separate identities, until they receive a command (for example through a small voltage or a current), upon which they mix strongly to either emit light, or flow as currents with very little energy dissipation. This sort of phenomena has been long desired for making low-power or ultrafast and energy-efficient electronic switches, for photonic devices, and potentially for sensor environments. Thus, findings of this project have a potential to impact the electronics and photonics industries, and environmental health and safety systems. The project trains graduate students in a fascinating emerging field at the intersection of physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. In addition to expanding existing outreach programs, new activities are considered with a special focus on the high-school students and underrepresented groups, including direct school visits and in-class demonstrations. The dissemination of research results in journal publications, presentations at conferences and inclusion in courses taught by the PI made available online ensures the outreach to the widest possible audience.<br/><br/>Technical description: This project explores the quantum transport and optical properties of III-nitride quantum structures and their potential applications in electron-hole bilayer systems, driven by large polarization fields. Such bilayers are difficult to create in other material systems either because of the lack of polarization, doping limitations, or because of low breakdown fields. When created (for example, in two-dimensional layered materials), additional challenges occur related to their chemical doping and contact reliability. In this project, the PI takes advantage of unique recent technological progress in epitaxially regrown contacts to two-dimensional electron and hole gases in novel compressively strained GaN quantum wells on AlN substrates to explore bilayer physics in a fundamentally new platform. Parallel two-dimensional systems of electrons and holes boast rich physics at several levels of complexity - from uncoupled two-dimensional electron-gas / two-dimensional hole gas p-n diodes that could lead to new electronic and photonic devices, to weakly coupled systems, exhibiting Coulomb drag, to strongly coupled systems that have shown glimpses of excitonic or Bose-Einstein condensation. And with the tantalizing possibility of polarization-driven topological edge states, the outcomes of the project has a potential for significant scientific and technological advances for ultra-low power electronic, photonic quantum information-processing applications."

Typical examples include boundary layers developing over surface irregularities on aircraft and wind turbine blades, macro bio-fouled ship hulls, edges of forests or wind-farms, urban canopies, crop boundaries, river-beds, and wind over rough seas. Despite decades of sustained research, accurate predictions of momentum transfers and/or skin-friction drag based on geometric information about the surface alone are difficult. This is primarily because in most cases, the topography of surface roughness is multi-scale, that is to say, it contains a wide variety of roughness length scales. Moreover, the variation in the range of roughness length scales and the distribution of the roughness features is heterogeneous across the surface. Current predictive approaches, designed mostly for homogeneous and single-scale roughness element distributions, can neither accurately predict nor offer insights into the complex physics of flow over multi-scale heterogeneous surfaces. In this collaborative research,a systematic approach to characterize drag and the mechanisms of momentum transfers in flows over heterogeneous multi-scale surfaces will be applied. This research will be broadly relevant to a large number of industries where flows over rough surfaces are critical for performance. In the transportation industry for example, the drag incurred by rough surfaces has important impact on transportation efficiency and its environmental footprint. This research is also important for understanding and modeling atmospheric flows, of relevance to weather prediction. The flows over complex terrain are currently poorly resolved in most atmospheric flow models and there is a need for improved predictive models. Better predictive models are also important for understanding flows in urban regions and wind farms.<br/><br/>In this project, a series of high-fidelity computer simulations - to be carried out at Johns Hopkins in the US - and of physical experiments - to be performed at Southampton in the UK - will generate unprecedented data of flows over heterogeneous, multi-scale surfaces. Numerical modeling will be based on Large Eddy Simulation that uses a novel integral wall model implemented in a high-accuracy finite difference solver that uses sharp immersed boundary method to resolve larger-scale roughness elements. Three different cases will be considered both numerically and experimentally: (i) an abrupt change in nature of multi-scale roughness, (ii) finite patch of multi-scale roughness, and (iii) repeated changes in multi-scale roughness. The data will be analyzed and simulations and experiments compared. The experimental and numerical data as well as the physical insights obtained will be used to test existing, and develop new, analytical models that enable accurate prediction of drag and momentum transfers based only on available information about the topography of multi-scale heterogeneous surfaces.  The project will strengthen graduate education, since the PhD student who will be a part of this project will gain substantial expertise in computational methods, modeling strategies and collaborating internationally with experimentalists. This training will be invaluable as these methodologies are widely recognized as areas of substantial growth in the coming decades, where experienced researchers will be most needed."

With technological advances in data collection, HFD occurs in medicine (from neuroscience to patient care), finance and economics, geosciences (such as earthquake data), marine science (fishing and shipping), and other areas. The research focuses on how to extract information from complex big data and how to turn data into knowledge. In particular, the project aims to develop cutting-edge mathematics and statistical methodology to uncover the dependence structure governing a HFD system. The new dependence structure will permit the ""borrowing"" of information from adjacent time periods, and also from other series from a panel of data. It is expected that the results will lead to more efficient estimators and better prediction and that this approach will form a new paradigm for HFD. In addition to developing a general theory, the project is concerned with applications to financial data, including risk management, forecasting, and portfolio management. More precise estimators, with improved margins of error, will be useful in all these areas of finance. The results are expected to be of interest to investors, regulators, and policymakers, and the results are entirely in the public domain. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create a unified framework for inference in high frequency data, based on dividing the observations and the parameter process into blocks. The work pursues two paths, both involving the fundamental structure of the data architecture. A ""within block"" approach uses contiguity to make the structure of the observations more accessible in local neighborhoods. The ""between block"" approach sets up a tool for using stochastic calculus to study the relationship between parameters in blocks that are adjacent (in time and space). It also permits the integration of high and low frequency models. This is achieved without altering current models. A final part of the project is devoted to further study of the observed asymptotic variance, in particular work on tuning parameters and inferential interpretation. Both the ""within block"" and ""between block"" approaches are formulated to cover general time varying ""parameters"" that are usually estimated from high frequency data series, not only volatility, but also skewness (leverage effect), regression coefficients, and parameter dynamics (such as volatility of volatility). In both cases, the observed data and also parameter processes may have large dimension (large panel size) in addition to high frequency observation. The within block approach permits contiguity to be stated jointly for the latent underlying processes and the microstructure/observation noise. For the between block approach, the investigators will further develop a new way to look at the dependence relationships between the parameters."

Now, imagine applying pressures up to a hundred times higher than that to solid materials: a rich collection of new phenomena and effects would emerge, which would shed light on our understanding of basic physics and development of useful new functionalities of these materials. This project does this on a special class of materials, layered transition metal dichalcogenides, where the interactions between neighboring layers are intrinsically weak, hence allowing an even wider range of modulation of the structure and properties by the high pressure. Integrated with the research effort, the principal investigator also runs an educational activity to create a series of hands-on exhibits and experiments for visits of middle-high school students in partnership with the local Techbridge Girls Program.<br/><br/>Technical description: In van der Waals (vdW) materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides, physical properties such as band structures are sensitive to interlayer coupling between neighboring monolayers across the vdW gap. If the interlayer coupling of vdW materials can be artificially enhanced, one can effectively modulate the electronic dimensionality, and study scientific problems of emergent physical behavior of the system under the dimensionality modulation that would not arise otherwise. The goals of this project are to enable, discover and understand emergent electronic behavior of vdW heterostructures by maximally modulating their interlayer coupling with high pressures. These goals are achieved by utilizing diamond anvil cells to apply hydrostatic pressures up to 60 GPa onto vdW heterostructures, and probing their vibrational, optical and transport properties. Exotic new phenomena have been predicted to emerge at such extreme conditions, but have not been experimentally tested or were tested only at very low temperatures where the thermal energy is insufficient to destroy the interlayer coupling. In this project, the principal investigator and his team test and probe these predictions by drastically enhancing the interlayer coupling energy in the vdW structures such that these effects could be stabilized even at room temperature. The research is expected to bring new knowledge on vdW materials behaviour under unprecedented conditions and to push the boundary of layered materials functionality beyond current establishments."

The natural domains of complex-number-valued functions are complex manifolds, including the n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. This project concerns the relationship between the geometry of a natural class of complex manifolds, called Kahler manifolds, and the behavior of complex functions on these manifolds.  One of the most beautiful results in complex analysis (the study of complex-valued functions) is the uniformization theorem, which says that one-dimensional complex manifolds have essentially only three shapes: a sphere, a disc, or a plane, corresponding to positive, negative, or zero curvature. A higher-dimensional version of uniformization has long eluded mathematicians; for example, it is conjectured that if an open n-dimensional complex manifold has positive curvature then it is a copy of complex n-space.  The PI will address this long-standing conjecture.  The resulting research, which lies at the intersection of many branches of mathematics, will establish new and interesting connections between analysis, algebra, differential geometry and topology.<br/><br/>More precisely, the PI will work on the uniformization conjecture of Yau, which states that a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with positive bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex n-space. So far there have been numerous attempts at this conjecture, starting with Mok-Siu-Yau in early 1980s.  Along with the uniformization conjecture, the PI will also address related problems such as Siu's conjecture on Stein-ness of complete noncompact Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature.  As in the PI's earlier work, the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence theory will serve as an important tool to study these conjectures. The PI will also study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Kahler manifolds with curvature lower bound (e.g., the degeneration of the complex structure). In some sense, this is a generalization of the breakthrough result of Donaldson-Sun on Kahler manifolds. The expectation is that the limit space should carry a natural complex analytic structure."

Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.<br/><br/>The project creates intensive research-based training courses in the life sciences for students and faculty, using zebrafish as a versatile model organism for classroom experiments. In Aim 1, a series of courses will be created, in partnership between faculty at tribal colleges (A'aniiih Nakoda College, Chief Dull Knife College, Little Big Horn College, and Fort Peck Community College) and research faculty at Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU). Each set of course curricula will reflect issues relevant to the specific faculty, students, and community. Aim 2, through week-long intensive courses, lays the foundation for tribal college faculty to develop or enhance their research mindset and skills to mentor undergraduate research endeavors at their respective colleges. Collaboration between tribal college faculty and the MSU scientists will continue to support tribal college faculty as they develop new, or enhance existing research projects and research-based courses. Aim 3 proposes that students will attend courses and then participate as student TAs for deeper engagement with the research mindset. Offering these courses at the tribal colleges allows students to attend the courses within their communities and permits these courses to act as stepping stones for future endeavors, including research programs at their tribal colleges and programs at 4-year universities like MSU."

Existing generators of terahertz radiation have significant deficiencies that severely limit their usefulness. These generators either work at temperatures below room temperature or are based on expensive and bulky laser systems. The goal of this project is to create a new type of terahertz generator that is compact, inexpensive and works at room temperature. These generators are based on readily available magnetic materials such as iron oxide and nickel oxide and will operate via conversion of magnetic oscillations in these materials into terahertz electromagnetic waves. The goal of the proposed research program will be achieved via a collaborative effort of a synergistic team of experts in magnetic device fabrication (University of California, Irvine) and leading theorists in the field of magnetic devices (Oakland University).   The results of the proposed research program will impact society in multiple ways. The new method of terahertz signal generation will help maintain the US leadership in terahertz technology. A number of undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in modern device fabrication techniques, which will enhance the US nanotechnology workforce. The outreach activities, including demonstrations on magnetism and superconductivity, will target middle school students from underrepresented groups, and will help attract minorities to science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research program is based on a substantial preliminary experimental and theoretical work of the proposers, who experimentally demonstrated spin pumping in Pt/hematite bi-layers, and theoretically predicted that a bi-layer of a heavy metal (Pt) and an antiferromagnetic material with strong easy-plane and weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropies can function as a source of coherent THz radiation when direct current is applied to the Pt layer. In such antiferromagnet-based auto-oscillators, an electric current in the Pt layer injects pure spin Hall current into the antiferromagnet and drives its order parameter into a state of persistent precession. This precession excited by the component of spin current perpendicular to the easy plane anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is non-uniform in time due to the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy present within the easy plane anisotropy. The frequency of the antiferromagnetic order parameter oscillations is proportional to the injected spin current, and increases from approximately 0.1 THz to 2.0 THz with increasing current density in the Pt layer. The order parameter oscillations are converted into a THz electromagnetic signal with electric field amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm via spin pumping and the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pt layer. The dynamics of the THz-frequency room-temperature antiferromagnetic auto-oscillator is mathematically equivalent to that of a Josephson junction auto-oscillator, with the energy of the weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the antiferromagnet playing the role of the Josephson energy. The demonstration of these compact, tunable and structurally simple antiferromagnet-based sources of THz radiation will enable the development of compact and inexpensive solid state THz devices for imaging, chemical detection, wireless chip-to-chip communication and THz spectroscopy/microscopy."

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal."

For example, existing cooling mechanisms cannot efficiently cool the extremely high power densities that are expected in exascale systems. Emerging cooling technologies, which may address these temperature challenges, are not easily accessible for experimentation to computer engineers. In fact, there is a substantial lag before a cooling technology becomes available for system design and optimization. Such lags cause design quality to be left on the table. To this end, this project proposes a software infrastructure that enables accurate modeling of cutting-edge cooling methods and that facilitates mutually customizing the computing and cooling systems to dramatically push system energy efficiency. <br/><br/>The proposed infrastructure is a system-level design automation tool that includes compact thermal models of emerging cooling methods (thermoelectric coolers, two-phase cooling with microchannels or nanopores, phase-change materials, and single-phase liquid cooling). The project plan includes (1) synthesizing novel device-level models into compact representations; (2) using measurements on prototypes for validation of the proposed models; and (3) developing automation tooling to co-design hybrid customized cooling subsystems together with a given computing system. The broader impact of the project will be to help advance computing beyond the limitations of Moore's Law by making efficient design of high-power-density systems possible. The proposed infrastructure will enable transformative research in design automation, computer architecture, and system design with emerging cooling technologies, particularly in the dimensions of performance, variability, energy, heterogeneity, and cross-layer design. The infrastructure will be released to the community as open source software. The interdisciplinary nature of the project creates ample opportunities for undergraduate projects and outreach programs for underrepresented groups and K-12 students."

Broadly, clustering methods which discover latent structure in data are our primary tool for navigating, exploring and visualizing massive datasets. These methods have been widely and successfully applied in phylogeny, medicine, psychiatry, archaeology and anthropology, phytosociology, economics and several other fields. Despite its ubiquity, the widespread scientific adoption of clustering methods have been hindered by the lack of flexible clustering methods for high-dimensional datasets and by the dearth of meaningful inferential guarantees in clustering problems. Accordingly, the goal of this research is to develop new and effective methods for clustering complex data-sets, and to further develop an inferential grounding -- which will in turn lead to actionable conclusions -- for these methods. This research will lead to the development of new clustering methods, as well as to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limitations of methods aimed at uncovering latent structure in data. <br/><br/>The research component of this project consists of four aims designed to address related aspects of this high-level goal: (a) analyze and develop new clustering methods for high-dimensional datasets, with a particular focus on practically useful methods like mixture-model based clustering, and minimum volume clustering; (b) develop novel methods for inference in the context of clustering, motivated by scientific applications where it is important not only to cluster the data but also to clearly characterize the sampling variability of the discovered clusters; (c) develop fundamental lower bounds for high-dimensional clustering (d) develop novel methods for clustering functional data with inferential guarantees. These research components are closely coupled with concrete educational initiatives, including the development and broad dissemination of publicly-available software for high-dimensional clustering; tutorials and workshops at Machine Learning conferences and fostering further interactions between the Departments of Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon."

This project investigates the intersection of these strategies and how they facilitate the persistence of blue crabs and a pathogenic virus along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The widespread distribution of this crab-virus system makes it useful for investigating host-pathogen interactions. Blue crabs can reduce their activity level and induce winter dormancy in colder climates, but it is unclear how this alters progression and transmission of the pathogen. Conversely, year-round growth and reproduction of tropical blue crabs may be offset by higher pathogen abundance and activity. This project will use a combination of field and laboratory studies to reveal how crab life history and pathogen dynamics interact and adapt at the extremes of their range. Genetic sequencing, crab movement tracking and oceanographic models will be used to understand how crab-disease dynamics vary across temperate and tropical latitudes. The blue crab is an ecologically and economically important species and knowledge generated in this project will help provide management guidance to support sustainable fisheries. Best practices to avoid and limit disease will be communicated to commercial and artisanal harvesters through partnerships and workshops. Local high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be engaged through a variety of formal and informal educational programs. Public outreach will be implemented through a museum partnership with the Shedd Aquarium and will include the training of a science communication intern.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine empirical field and laboratory experiments, population genomics, and biophysical modeling to explore the consequences of latitude-driven changes in life history and oceanic connectivity on a trans-hemispheric pathosystem comprised of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the pathogenic virus, CsRV1. The virulence of the CsRV1 virus from tropical and temperate latitudes and the impact of overwintering will be studied by experimental virus challenges of crabs transplanted between high and low latitudes. The impact of infection and virulence on crab movement will be investigated in laboratory raceway experiments of healthy and infected crabs and in the field with acoustically tagged crabs deployed in temperate and tropical locations. Population genetic studies using thousands of genome-wide RAD sequencing markers for crabs and whole-genome sequencing for the virus will define genetic connectivity of crab and virus populations across their range, and will investigate the possible latitudinal, seascape, and life history-driven changes in blue crab and virus genomes. The two population genomic data sets are expected to provide different inferences and scales of connectivity because CsRV1 virus genotypes are transmitted only among post-larval crabs while blue crab genotypes also move by a potentially long-range dispersive larval stage. Finally, integrated biophysical models will be used to investigate the relative contributions of adult and larval dispersal on the population structure of the crab and the pathogen across a broad swath of habitat between New England and Argentina with a decade of simulations. An open-source Lagrangian stochastic model will estimate pelagic larval transport, and spatially explicit biased-correlated random walk models will estimate adult movement. Models will be informed by experimentally-derived movement and behavior data, as well as information on crab larval and adult behavior and overwintering duration available in the published literature. Under a series of scenarios in which crab behavior is affected by latitude and virus infection, statistical comparisons will be made between biophysical model-based predictions of connectivity and genetic estimates of connectivity. These analyses will advance our understanding of the physical, environmental, and biological factors that shape the dynamics of the blue crab CsRV1 pathosystem."

The event will take place on Sunday, October 29, immediately preceding and in conjunction with the 19th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS 2017), to be held October 30-November 1 in Baltimore,, MD.  The ASSETS conferences are the premier forum for presenting innovative research on the design and use of both mainstream and specialized assistive technologies.  This includes the use of technology by and in support of: individuals with hearing, vision and other sensory impairments; individuals with motor impairments; individuals with memory, learning and cognitive impairments; individuals with multiple impairments; older adults; and professionals who work with these populations.  Researchers and developers from around the world, in both academia and industry, will meet at ASSETS 2017 to exchange ideas and present their latest work.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://assets17.sigaccess.org/.   A key component of building any community is through its youth.  The Doctoral Consortium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in this field, by providing them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community.  It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  The organizers will take steps to promote participation from institutions with relatively large numbers of students from under-represented groups.  To further increase diversity, the organizers will aim for equal participation of females and males in the consortium, and will not invite more than 1 or 2 students from the same educational institution; if two students from the same educational institution are selected, the organizers will ensure that at least one of them is from an underrepresented minority in STEM.  In an effort to further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, a session has been set aside in the technical program to allow all Doctoral Consortium participants to present their research to the full conference.<br/><br/>The ASSETS 2017 Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused meeting of an international group of selected Ph.D. candidates and an international panel of distinguished research faculty (the latter yet to be named).  It will provide an opportunity for graduate students from diverse backgrounds (computing, engineering, psychology, architecture, etc.) to come together and explore their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of the PI and the panel of experts, so that they can appreciate the broader spectrum of research and development approaches to assistive technologies and universal usability, and also experience the community in which they can pursue their endeavors.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the consortium, and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Thus, the consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at assistive technologies and universal access, will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in these interdisciplinary fields, and will also expose the young researchers to a larger community.  In addition, the faculty will give a presentation on job opportunities for researchers in both academia and industry, to better inform the students when considering career options.  An evaluation of the consortium will be conducted and the results made available to the organizers of future such events."

Professor Johnson is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The synthesis of organic molecules is central to a wide variety of scientific endeavors ranging from the discovery of new drugs to the development of new materials. Typically, these synthetic efforts have at their origin a small molecule that it built upon by various functional groups. Professor Johnson is developing new methods for rapidly accessing these valuable small starting blocks from inexpensive, abundant feedstock chemicals. The transformations are accomplished using catalysts that are not consumed in the reactions along with environmentally-friendly chemicals like molecular oxygen and molecular hydrogen in order to ensure that the processes are sustainable.  This project provides an ideal platform for training graduate, undergraduate, and high school students from all backgrounds.  Professor Johnson's group has a history of inclusion and diversity, and as department chairperson, he is in an excellent position to continue advancing initiatives that contribute to the overall diversity of the department.<br/><br/>The creation of highly functionalized, stereochemically-defined small molecule building blocks is central to many scientific endeavors, particularly in the realm of drug discovery and chemical biology.  An ongoing challenge is the development of tools that not only deliver novel chemical entities, but do so in a way that is sustainable.  This proposal seeks to develop new chemical reactions and sequences that operate at the intersection of these two issues in chemical synthesis.  This project provides reveals uniquely enabling mechanisms for reactions of strained ring compounds. It is expected that this expansion of the strained ring paradigm into substructures derived from commercial, readily available feedstock chemical may provide unique, efficient access to heretofore unknown chemical matter.  The reactions under study rapidly develop complex three-dimensional architectures from planar aromatics in a few chemical operations.  The outreach plan integrates the research team into the local community for STEAM Day at Northside Elementary School, which serves a majority non-white student population in North Carolina."

For this project, the investigators will build a large library of high-quality spectra for about 6000 stars using observations made on existing telescopes and instruments.  This project will serve the national interest as it promotes the progress of research in astronomy by providing high-quality standards for astronomers to use to do their research.  The investigators will make and use a teaching unit with a web app for introductory college astronomy education that will help students understand how astronomers can learn about populations of stars using spectra.  They will also train graduate students and run outreach activities.<br/><br/>Stellar spectral libraries underpin spectroscopic analysis in stellar, galactic, and extragalactic astronomy; they are fundamental for modeling stellar populations in galaxies.  Existing empirical stellar libraries have poor sampling in several important parts of the stellar parameter space, do not provide adequate wavelength coverage and spectral resolution for the state-of-the-art galaxy surveys, and often have poor flux calibration.  Theoretical stellar libraries are not yet realistic enough to match the observed colors of stars and galaxies; this reveals an incomplete understanding of important stellar physics.  To address these problems, the investigators will build a large, well-calibrated, high quality empirical stellar library of ~6000 stars with much more extensive coverage of stellar parameter space than previous efforts.  The spectra will cover the wavelength range of 3600-10,300 at a resolution of R~2000, with better than 3% relative flux calibration.  It will be achieved by conducting parallel optical observations piggybacking on the APOGEE-2 survey as part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV.

All these populations formed more than 8 billion years ago and must be younger than about 13.7 billion years old, the age of the Universe.  For perspective, the Sun is about 4.5 billion years old.  Yet, the ages of each of these Galactic populations is uncertain to one or two billion years.  Without better knowledge of the ages of these populations, astronomers cannot answer fundamental questions about the formation of the Galaxy.  To progress on these questions, astronomers need to improve how they determine the ages of stars.  The investigators developed a new technique that more precisely determines the ages of stars than any prior technique.  This technique takes advantage of data from the Gaia satellite and advanced Bayesian statistics.<br/><br/>The project will train physics, mathematics, and software engineering students at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in modern statistical and analysis methods.  The students will gain valuable experience working with researchers and students abroad.  The team includes the statistics group at Imperial College in London, England, and the Gaia research group at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany.  The project is committed to including the full participation of women and underrepresented minorities.  Therefore, the project will improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in the United States.  It will also contribute to a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Many types of stars are presently used as age proxies, yet among them white dwarf stars hold the most promise.  A white dwarf's luminosity directly encodes its age, but this relies on accurately measuring its distance.  The Gaia satellite is currently measuring the most accurate and precise trigonometric parallax distances ever obtained.  Among the ~1.7 billion stars that Gaia is observing, there will be ~15,000 white dwarfs within 100 pc with typical distance uncertainties < 1%.  This compares to only two white dwarfs with distances presently known this accurately.  The proposers will combine these Gaia data with optical and near-infrared photometry from ground-based surveys.  They will analyze these data with their well-tested modeling technique, which relies on Bayesian statistics and state-of-the-art model ingredients.  These unprecedented data and new modeling technique will allow the proposers to (1) derive ages for thousands of white dwarfs with typical age precisions of 1 to 5%, and then subsequently determine (2) the star formation history in the disk, (3) the onset and cessation of star formation in the thick disk, and (4) the mean age and age dispersion of the halo."

The event brings together a group graduate students with demonstrated interest and research experience in the field of electrochemistry with renowned electrochemists from across North America. The primary objective of the activity is to present fundamental questions and research at the frontiers of the field, and develop innovative strategies to address current gaps through collaboration and critical thinking. The format of NGenE is designed to accelerate advances at the frontier of electrochemistry in the United States, while developing a close-knit community of collaborators intent on tackling the most important fundamental questions with a direct impact on society, for instance, through novel energy technologies. The fundamental aspects presented by the instructors are broadly relevant, often applicable in other sub-fields of electrochemical research. A salient feature of the structure of NGenE is to contribute to the training of the next generation of electrochemists, fostering their critical thinking, and providing the tools to identify and tackle pioneering research priorities that produce meaningful societal advances through economic and environmental benefits.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>Next Generation Electrochemistry (NGenE) brings approximately 40 advanced graduate students and 10 distinguished lecturers together for five days to explore the frontiers of our scientific knowledge in electrochemistry. They examine fundamental phenomena that control the reactivity, transport and stability of electrochemical processes at an advanced level, identifying critical gaps in our understanding and innovative strategies to address them. NGenE explores these research frontiers through lectures, discussions and demonstrations, including a site visit to cutting-edge facilities at Argonne National Laboratory, as well as research projects developed by students under the mentoring of NGenE faculty. Faculty stimulate discussion by bringing unsolved challenges at the frontiers of electrochemistry to the fore, while working with students to develop and design innovative, forward-looking synthesis, characterization, theory, and simulation to solve problems in electrochemical science. The activity assumes baseline knowledge and prior experience in electrochemistry. As a result, NGenE does not ask, ""What is electrochemistry?"" but instead ""What will electrochemistry become?"" This focus on the fundamental knowledge gaps distinguishes NGenE from other summer workshops in electrochemistry. The goal of the activity is to stimulate a dialog between the current and the next generation of scientists in electrochemistry that spurs, in the future, an accelerated development of electrochemical science impacting applications in energy, medicine and manufacturing. This outcome would provide a clear societal benefit and contribute to the leadership of the US in this important discipline."

First, organized heterogeneous information networks (hence called StructNet) are constructed, and then powerful mining mechanisms on such organized networks are developed.  With a focus on biomedical sciences, the project investigates the principles, methodologies and algorithms for (i) construction of relatively structured heterogeneous information networks (called MediNet) by mining biomedical research corpora via attribute extraction, relation typing, and claim mining, and (ii) exploration and mining of the networks so constructed via graph OLAP and task-guided embedding. The project develops an extensible framework to facilitate literature-based scientific research. The study on construction and exploration of MediNet not only impacts biomedical research but also consolidates this data-to-network-to knowledge methodology, readily to be transferred to other domains,  for automatic transformation of massive unstructured text data in those domains into structured and actionable knowledge."

Current state-of-the-art systems require significant computer post-processing and expensive hardware.  This project will lead to a novel camera positioning system (hardware) and real-time vision (software) system that does not require any post-processing and produces ready-to-use images in real-time. To achieve this goal, the project draws upon the biomechanical and cognitive principles of human vision. The innovative methods and algorithms that can produce motions with speed, accuracy, and smoothness to mimic human eye can greatly enhance capabilities of autonomous vehicles used in a wide variety of applications such as agriculture, military, security, and traffic monitoring. The project will integrate research and outreach activities for K-12 and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project studies a bio-inspired dynamics-based method for coordinating motion control and image processing where the system can mechanically displace the field of view by a large angle between frames. The concept behind this research is to merge the system dynamics area and image processing area while previous studies focused solely on either mechanical design or image processing.  The method is motivated by the principles of human vision for effective image de-blurring and panoramic image stitching. In coordination with inherently discrete and rapid ocular movements, the developed image processing methods inspired by ocular physiology will mimic saccades and smooth-pursuit in a fast-moving robotic eye.  A piezoelectrically driven robotic camera positioning mechanism will be employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this ocular physiology-inspired approach. Hardware architecture that can synchronize image processing and real-time motion control will be configured and tested. A panoramic image of a scene will be generated from multiple images acquired during saccades by removing motion blur and stitching images within a single frame rate. The system architecture will be optimized to best coordinate hardware and software for real-time motion control."

One of the most fundamental and important problems in number theory is to solve Diophantine equations, that is, to find integer solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. For example, the famous Fermat's Last Theorem concerns one class of Diophantine equations. In modern mathematical language, Diophantine equations can be encoded into a geometric notion, called algebraic varieties. Then the information of the solution will give rise to an arithmetic invariant of the corresponding algebraic variety. However, these algebraic varieties carry other important invariants related to the arithmetic one via the so-called L-function. It is often possible to transfer information from different invariants and achieve better understanding of all of them. This project aims to deepen understanding of fundamental relationships among such mathematical constructs.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is to study L-functions of motives, which are a systematic generalization of algebraic varieties, via studying various aspects of Shimura varieties and the method of Arakelov geometry. The L-functions of motives play an important role in the current research in number theory, automorphic representations, and arithmetic geometry, as they encode crucial information from all these aspects. The Langlands Program predicts that motives, like rational elliptic curves, are linked with automorphic forms through L-functions. This project investigates five topics: (1) the Bloch-Kato conjecture for motives appearing in the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture; (2) modularity of Hecke actions on special cycles on Shimura varieties; (3) potential theory on non-Archimedean spaces and its connection to Arakelov geometry; (4) a higher derivative version of the Rallis inner product formula over function fields; and (5) nearby cycles for Artin stacks over general bases."

In symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics -- points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider a class of half-dimensional subspaces called Lagrangian submanifolds. Considering the geometry of these submanifolds, rather than points, naturally gives rise to a noncommutative space: the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry,"" asserts that many Fukaya categories are in fact equivalent to conventional commutative spaces such as those studied in algebraic geometry. The main goal of this research project is to expand the range of settings to which mirror symmetry is applicable. <br/><br/>Specifically, the goal is to establish homological mirror symmetry in a broad enough setting to exhibit all (commutative) algebraic spaces defined by systems of polynomial equations as instances of Fukaya categories. A key step in this program is to study the non-commutative geometry that arises from a symplectic manifold equipped with one or more (commuting) functions.  More specifically, the main goal of this project is to prove Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for all complete intersections in (possibly noncompact) toric varieties. The mirror spaces in this setting are so-called toric Landau-Ginzburg models (i.e., noncompact toric Calabi-Yau varieties equipped with regular functions). A key ingredient in the study of their Fukaya categories is the concept of simultaneous admissibility with respect to a collection of toric monomials. This gives a new approach to the Floer-theoretic calculations needed to prove homological mirror symmetry. The expected outcome will be a framework for understanding mirror symmetry that places varieties of general type (including noncompact ones) on the same footing as the more classical Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. This project will also investigate some apparently new structural features of Fukaya categories for Landau-Ginzburg models and for affine varieties, which suggest previously unnoticed functoriality properties of homological mirror symmetry, as well as a new approach to computations for affine varieties."

A perfect example of the field's reach is offered by the so-called Tracy-Widom laws. First discovered in the description of the largest eigenvalues for certain large random matrices, these laws are now understood to serve the role of the ""bell curve"" (or provide the appropriate central limit theorem) for a wide area of modern nonlinear phenomena. The main objective of this research is to advance our understanding of these and other probability laws introduced through the study of random matrices. The focus is on their basic mathematical properties, as well as extending the class of models in which they apply.<br/><br/>The research builds in part on the PI's recent work on the general beta extensions of the Tracy-Widom and related distributions. These extensions have the advantage of embedding the more familiar triple(s) of limit laws (tied to the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry classes) into a one-parameter family of distributions defined via random differential operators. The main goal here is to push this approach toward descriptions of more exotic limit theorems, such as the higher order Tracy-Widom laws and various double scaling regimes (again in the general beta context). Additional projects center around a recently established matrix version of the classical Dufresne identity for integrated geometric Brownian motion as well as solvable matrix models which interpolate between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Symplectic Ensembles and can be viewed as multi-type coulomb gases."

With technological advances in data collection, HFD occurs in medicine (from neuroscience to patient care), finance and economics, geosciences (such as earthquake data), marine science (fishing and shipping), and other areas. The research focuses on how to extract information from complex big data and how to turn data into knowledge. In particular, the project aims to develop cutting-edge mathematics and statistical methodology to uncover the dependence structure governing a HFD system. The new dependence structure will permit the ""borrowing"" of information from adjacent time periods, and also from other series from a panel of data. It is expected that the results will lead to more efficient estimators and better prediction and that this approach will form a new paradigm for HFD. In addition to developing a general theory, the project is concerned with applications to financial data, including risk management, forecasting, and portfolio management. More precise estimators, with improved margins of error, will be useful in all these areas of finance. The results are expected to be of interest to investors, regulators, and policymakers, and the results are entirely in the public domain. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create a unified framework for inference in high frequency data, based on dividing the observations and the parameter process into blocks. The work pursues two paths, both involving the fundamental structure of the data architecture. A ""within block"" approach uses contiguity to make the structure of the observations more accessible in local neighborhoods. The ""between block"" approach sets up a tool for using stochastic calculus to study the relationship between parameters in blocks that are adjacent (in time and space). It also permits the integration of high and low frequency models. This is achieved without altering current models. A final part of the project is devoted to further study of the observed asymptotic variance, in particular work on tuning parameters and inferential interpretation. Both the ""within block"" and ""between block"" approaches are formulated to cover general time varying ""parameters"" that are usually estimated from high frequency data series, not only volatility, but also skewness (leverage effect), regression coefficients, and parameter dynamics (such as volatility of volatility). In both cases, the observed data and also parameter processes may have large dimension (large panel size) in addition to high frequency observation. The within block approach permits contiguity to be stated jointly for the latent underlying processes and the microstructure/observation noise. For the between block approach, the investigators will further develop a new way to look at the dependence relationships between the parameters."

Hoye. Professor Hoye is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota. He is developing new chemical reactions that allow for the synthesis of novel molecules known as polycylic aromatics. These molecules are valuable for a variety of reasons, one being their potential for use in optoelectronic devices such as the organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaic cells that are used in energy efficient displays, lighting units, and for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. By developing a fundamental understanding of the new reactions used to make polycyclic aromatics, Professor Hoye and his coworkers may push the chemical reactions toward the synthesis of compounds having previously unknown chemical structures and, in the future, build new materials with improved properties. A number of significant broader impacts of benefit to a wide group of stakeholders result from the project. Of particular note are research opportunities for undergraduate research students, a tutorial on the practical separation of complex organic mixtures, and new extensions of the Minnesota State Fair exhibit on ""Sustainable Polymers.""<br/><br/>Professor Hoye's research group is capitalizing on the tremendous potential for the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction cascade to provide for the rapid chemical synthesis of manifold classes of highly conjugated polycyclic aromatics. Some are of value to the field of organic electronic and photonic materials research.  Collaborations are in place to pursue early phases of such development. It is the methods and strategies for the syntheses of such compounds that are the most important 'products' that are emerging from this project. Preliminary results demonstrate that the synthetic routes are often remarkably short and efficient. New and fundamentally important mechanistic knowledge is also emerging. Advances in the benzyne chemistry include new aspects of cycloaddition reactions, two-directional benzyne trapping, and controlled oligomer synthesis. A process dubbed the 'domino-HDDA reaction' is particularly intriguing. Professor Hoye holds major teaching awards that recognize his career-long commitment to the education of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Outreach activities supported by this project benefit chemistry research students at multiple levels and contribute to the education of the public in the arenas of green chemistry and sustainable polymers. The scientific advances have the possibility of opening new avenues for pursuit by materials scientists who use organic electronic and photonic compounds in the settings of light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and solar cells.  These applications have a large potential for societal impact."

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

To understand such a model, one must describe how the system will evolve in time. Of interest is whether the solution grows with time, and whether the short-term behavior of the system is different from the behavior over a large-time window.  This project aims to develop tools to help scientists and engineers better analyze a challenging class of models in which the system's current rate-of-change is dictated by its configuration at some time in the recent past, models known as ""delay systems.""  Compelling examples come from biology, where this delay could correspond to gestation in a population, the incubation of a disease, or the time for a pill to dissolve.  In many important scenarios, highly accurate models require thousands or millions of variables.  This project will design high-performance computing algorithms to efficiently assess the behavior of such systems.<br/><br/>The research team will develop a new class of algorithms that are derived from interpolation techniques for model reduction of large-scale dynamical systems, for solving important large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems.  Nonlinear eigenvalue problems play an increasingly important role in many applications, including the stability analysis of delay differential equations.  Such problems pose a great challenge to computation: the number of eigenvalues is often infinite, even when the dimension of the problem is finite.   This project's interpolation-based techniques hold the promise of accurately modeling nonlinear operators over a broad region of the complex plane, resulting in algorithms that are both more efficient and more robust than existing methods.  Combining interpolation with structure-preserving subspace projection has the potential to approximate a much larger number of eigenvalues than possible with traditional methods.  To understand the performance of these new algorithms and to improve their speed, the project will also address convergence theory; for greater efficiency the project will explore inexact solution methods. Improved solvers for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem will inform development of the other two main aspects of this project: determination of critical stability transitions as a function of parameters (such as the time delays) in differential equations, and an enhanced understanding of the transient behavior of dynamical systems associated with nonlinear eigenvalue problems.  This project is expected to lead to substantial improvements in algorithms and analysis for the nonlinear eigenvalue problem and related stability questions."

Better solid state electrolytes will enable the development of safer batteries with improved lifetimes, and have the potential to completely eliminate the flammability and toxicity associated with current organic electrolyte technologies for Li-ion batteries.  This project will lead to the discovery of better solid state electrolytes both by evaluating new candidate compounds and by carrying out fundamental studies to better understand how Li ions diffuse through solid electrolytes.  This work will be supported by diffraction studies at national user facilities that will allow the accurate determination of the crystal structure of solid electrolytes at the atomic scale, allowing the mechanism of ionic motion to be understood.  This project will additionally support the training of young researchers in advanced structural characterization methods through a national summer school on structural analysis to be offered every year.  The integration of solid state electrolytes into next-generation Li-ion batteries has the potential to completely eliminate battery fires, to extend the range and reduce the cost of electric vehicles, and to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid by providing low-cost load leveling.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>In the last 50 years, only about half a dozen structural families of superionic conductors for Li and Na ions have been discovered.  A major goal of this proposal is the identification of new superionic conductors, an aim which will be supported by fundamental studies to identify and control the structural features that most directly influence the ionic conductivity.  The development of improved solid state superionic conductors that can replace the organic liquid electrolytes (which are responsible for major flammability, toxicity, and lifetime issues) in current Li-ion battery systems will lead to safer batteries with improved lifetimes.  Fundamental studies will be carried out to understand and optimize the conductivity of ions at room temperature within a special CUBICON ceramic host whose cubic symmetry allows ions to be transported equally well in all directions, unlike most other alternative systems.  First, chemical syntheses (solid state and ion exchange) will be carried out to prepare a variety of single-phase CUBICON materials of known and novel compositions.  Next, X-ray and neutron diffraction studies will be carried out to accurately locate the positions of atoms (enabling both qualitative estimates and quantitative calculations of the strength of bonding and mobility of ions). New in situ methods will be applied to determine ion exchange mechanisms relevant to their synthesis.  Finally, physical properties measurements will be done to assess the ionic and electronic conductivity of these materials, and to identify design rules than can be used to prepare CUBICON materials with optimal properties."

These materials are characterized by a small concentration of highly mobile electrons with polarized magnetic moments. As a result of the small concentration and the high mobility of these polarized electrons, quantum effects can be observed at low magnetic fields and moderate temperatures within the reach of most small laboratories. The main quantum effect in the magnetic topological semimetals is that their magnetic order determines their electrical conduction and vice versa. Therefore, they can act as magnetic switches, memories, or sensors capable of operating at very small magnetic fields and moderate temperatures which is the most useful range for applications. The project relies on a feedback loop between theoretical calculations, materials synthesis, and characterizations through a combination of chemistry, physics, and materials science techniques. The cross-disciplinary nature of this project provides a unique educational platform for young scientists, from postdocs to graduate and undergraduate students. A new interdisciplinary course is designed by the PI to teach the chemistry and the physics of novel quantum materials to graduate students from both disciplines. The PI makes a conscious effort to connect his research to the society by presenting public lectures and demonstrations at several libraries to explain the physics and the chemistry of materials to the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>While most of the current studies on topological semimetals are focused on non-magnetic intermetallic compounds, the PI wants to deliberately take a different trajectory to look at the magnetic compounds with topological potentials. The materials explorations in this project exploit recent advances in the theoretical classification of topological systems based on the crystalline and the time reversal symmetries. The impact of the project is to open a new direction in topological materials design by incorporating magnetism with Dirac/Weyl physics in a systematic way. The project is particularly timely due to the rapid advances in the field of non-magnetic semimetals. The final goal is to engineer novel electronic phases such as chiral conductors which are stabilized by the internal molecular field of the material without the need for an external magnetic field. The project relies on a feedback loop between material synthesis, x-ray crystallography, physical measurements, electron microscopy, and DFT calculations to identify materials candidates, to grow high quality single crystals, and to thoroughly characterize them. The interdisciplinary environment of the PI's lab provides a unique educational environment from undergraduate to postdoctoral level. Connected to this research, a new course titled ""from bonds to bands"" is developed by the PI for both physics and chemistry graduate students to demonstrate the formation of extended solids from bonding between atoms and molecules."

With the shifting demographics of the country, there is also an imperative need to attract women and people from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering to address this workforce shortage. Community colleges are well suited to be a resource in these efforts with the potential to increase both the number and diversity of such qualified engineers. Although community colleges have received much attention in recent years, little is known about the experiences of community college engineering students as they complete their coursework at the community college and transfer to the next stage of their life (e.g., accredited engineering program or their career). As this time period critically influences students' chosen pathways to engineering careers, this study seeks to understand the lived and told experiences of community college engineering students, specifically focusing on those from underrepresented groups (URGs). As this is a budding, diverse pool of talent with promise in meeting the workforce needs, this project has the potential to uncover barriers and catalysts that URGs experience as they progress in their education in multiple contexts. <br/><br/>This project involves diverse community college programs spanning three U.S. Census regions, which could inform both community college programs and four-year institutions across the country. This work also leverages the progress of prior National Science Foundation investments in community colleges while addressing issues of social justice such as inequity and exclusion, which are perpetuated when pathways to Bachelor's degrees are less accessible for particular groups of students - here, community college students. Specifically, the project will address the following research questions: <br/>RQ1: What are the lived and told stories of community college engineering students from URGs? <br/>RQ2: How do URG community college students' understandings of their experiences and the relationship of those experiences to the environment influence their plans for future education and careers? <br/>RQ3: In what ways, if any, do community college engineering students' narratives bring to light issues of oppression, privilege and inequality? <br/><br/>In this narrative inquiry project, the project will conduct a series of in-depth interviews with participants from underrepresented groups at three community college systems in Virginia, Texas, and Arizona, where the selected institutions each serve large numbers of students from underrepresented groups.  These community colleges were chosen intentionally as they have close proximity to and/or articulation agreements with four-year institutions with engineering programs. Gaining a better understanding of student experiences promises to enable proactive development of strategies to position and prepare students to pursue four-year degrees from the inception of their studies at community colleges. Moreover, findings from this study promise to shed light on why existing efforts to increase transfer rates to four-year institutions have had limited effectiveness, which could inform academia, industry, and government."

Under the influence of gravity alone, all this gas should have collapsed into stars.  However, most of the matter in the Universe is not in stars; it is diffuse gas.  Furthermore, galaxies rarely show gas falling in; it is almost always flowing out.  Study of diffuse gas around galaxies is needed to understand how some small fraction of this tenuous vapor finally gave rise to the universe we know today.  In this project, Rubin and collaborators take advantage of new observations of hundreds of galaxies that reveal nearby gas.  Their specialized methods are sensitive to cool gas, which is relatively massive and dense.  They can image its position and determine its velocity relative to each galaxy.  The result will be a large sample of galaxies and gas flows to provide new constraints for theoretical models.   The PI will recruit and train undergraduates from underserved populations to participate in the analysis.  Suitable projects that fit into the overall research plan have been defined.  These projects make use of modern, inquiry-based teaching methods.<br/><br/>This project will draw upon data from the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey / Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) initiative, which has obtained integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy of several thousand nearby galaxies.  Rubin and collaborators will study cold, neutral gas via the Na I transition, which is accessible to ground-based, optical spectroscopy.  They will form two dimensional velocity maps of this gas and compare them to broadband imaging of each galaxy.  These data will be augmented with a complementary study of Ca II and Na I absorption spectroscopy of a sample of galaxies with fortuitously aligned, background-illuminating quasars.  This complementary investigation will be performed using Keck telescope observations, for which partial time has already been awarded.  Together, these investigations will provide a census of the incidence, morphology, and mass of gas inflows.

Piezoelectric nanowires can convert mechanical energy into electrical power, and extend the applications for implanted biomedical devices. They can be used where solar energy is unreliable. However, there are significant roadblocks for nano and micro systems to realize their full potential. Current methods used for making these systems require many discrete processes, expensive equipment in addition to a clean room environment resulting in prohibitive cost. Each process requires long preparation, handling and processing times. For faster throughput, huge investments must be made for automation, justifiable only for mass production. In general, cost has become a roadblock against capturing the benefits of most nanotechnology innovations. Therefore, a need in nanomanufacturing is to develop innovative flexible processes that enable integration for efficient small and medium lot size production. This award is to work on a single equipment that can perform multiple tasks required for processing heterogeneous nanomaterials and integrating them into a device. The non-cleanroom method is scalable and has shown more than two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in zinc oxide nanowire performance, reduction of six processes in to one, and reduction of equipment investment by a factor of ten. This research advances the fundamental understanding of the capabilities and performance of this single-step approach for processing and integrating heterogeneous materials and devices. The project plans to recruit female and under-represented minority graduate students, use the research results in new coursework and organize symposia as a platform for stimulating and exchanging new ideas.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to study and develop a novel integrated nanomanufacturing process for self-powered nanosensor systems. The research involves understanding the process-structure-properties-performance relationships in these materials and systems. The objectives of this research project are to uncover the correlations among the nucleation density, growth and morphology of the ZnO nanowire arrays produced by a pulsed laser; the correlation of the piezoelectric properties and the morphology of the ZnO nanowire arrays; the correlation of the performance of the piezoelectric nanogenerator subassembly and the piezoelectric properties, and the integration of a nanosensor into the self-powered nanogenerator system. The main outcome of this research is the understanding of the mechanisms and relationships among pulsed laser parameters, crystal nucleation and morphology control of ZnO nanowire arrays, and its impact on the material properties and performance in self-powered nanosensing systems."

In spite of their importance in a variety of devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), power transistors, and high-efficiency solar cells, much remains unknown about the crystalline growth processes occurring at the interface between these important materials. In order to achieve the integration of these materials for next generation devices, an improved understanding of the interface chemistry, growth mechanisms, metallurgical reactions, and resulting defect formation at this important interface is needed. This project utilizes a recently developed low temperature crystal growth process, capable of achieving commercially advantageous, high-throughput rates with various analyses to study the complex interfacial phenomena and extend the use of III-Nitrides to include the elusive material AlGaInN. A mechanism to control these phenomena, possibly reducing defects and enabling future applications is also targeted. This project provides graduate students access to cutting-edge technology and resources at the intersection of physics, materials science, and nanoelectronics. The resulting device platform has the potential to lead to innovations in energy saving devices, communications, solar cells, and medical device technologies. Social and academic outreach programs are expanded to include demonstrations for elementary to high school students. This research provides new opportunities for the dissemination and publication of detailed methods for achieving (AlGaIn)-Nitride and Silicon device integration.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  This project explores the development of heterostructures composed of quaternary III-Nitrides (AlGaInN) and Silicon for electronic and optoelectronic device integration. While AlN on Silicon is largely commercialized, all other commonly available III-Nitride alloys including GaN, InN, AlGaN and InGaN are substantially not implemented directly on Silicon substrates. Furthermore, the daunting challenge of growing quaternaries of AlGaInN has not been mastered, especially not on silicon substrates. Early attempts to control the naturally occurring growth phenomena at III-Nitride/Si interfaces were limited to the case where an insulating aluminum nitride interlayer was acceptable, as in lateral transistors like high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). For those cases where insulating barriers are not acceptable, as in future vertical conduction devices, e.g. transistors, LEDs, solar cells, and power devices, limited scientific understanding and no existing commercial success has been demonstrated. The recent demonstration of low temperature, rapid growth methods such as Metal Modulated Epitaxy (MME) with growth rates up to 9.8 microns/hr is providing new possibilities to ""freeze in"" new phases thought previously too challenging. Since MME is performed at extremely low temperatures (300 degrees C for indium nitride and ~500-600 degrees C for gallium nitride), the ability to control the interface diffusion, elimination of eutectic driven substrate etching, and control of interface planarity, all by using kinetically limited diffusion is viable. Furthermore, having already been proven to overcome phase separation challenges of InGaN, MME is viable for overcoming the same challenges of quaternary AlGaInN as well. The goal of this basic research effort is to better understand and control the interface kinetics of III-Nitride/Silicon heterojunctions, provide high quality quaternary III-Nitride materials and identify a better solution for vertical conduction devices integrated on silicon that eliminates the insulating AlN interlayer commonly used in silicon/nitride electronics today. The successful execution of this project has the potential to lead to a detailed understanding of the chemical and metallurgical interactions between III-Nitrides and Silicon including quantification of diffusion and reaction coefficients. This is the foundation required for next generation vertical power transistors on silicon that integrate smart CMOS devices with the enhanced power handling capabilities of III-Nitrides and LEDs for solid-state lighting grown on low-cost (even removable/disposable) large area silicon substrates."

They are not alone. Migration over short and long distances is a widespread animal behavior. Just why so many species risk the perils and uncertainties of migration is a puzzle. Many theories exist to help understand how this seemingly costly behavior evolved. To evaluate these, it is necessary to think small, namely, at the role played by parasites and pathogens. By combining knowledge from animal movement and infectious disease ecology, the researchers will develop mathematical models to study the evolution of migration. This research will not only improve our understanding of host movement and parasites, but will also advance migration theory broadly. Fully understanding what factors drive migration is crucial for predicting how migratory patterns will continue to adaptively change in the future. This project will address a broad range of problems of social and economic interest such as disease spread between migrating wildlife and livestock. It also will help our understanding of the influence of increasing human travel on emergent diseases. The researchers will engage undergraduate students through teaching modules at the University of Minnesota. In addition, they will provide opportunities for independent research projects. The research findings will be communicated to the public at the Bell Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>Despite growing interest in how host migration interacts with infection by pathogens and parasites, there is no rigorous framework to organize, interpret, and predict these interactions. Host movement can either increase or decrease host exposure to parasites and verbal models have generated conflicting predictions. The lack of understanding of when each outcome is likely to occur represents a serious roadblock in our ability to anticipate potential consequences of shifting environmental conditions for both migration and host-parasite dynamics. This research is the first step in overcoming this obstacle. It will use proof-of-concept mathematical models to rigorously test the links between specific assumptions and resulting predictions regarding host movement and parasites. The goal of the work is to develop models that are broadly applicable across systems, but have not yet been considered. Analytical models will be used to test how (a) parasite transmission mode (direct host-to-host-contact versus indirectly through the environment), (b) type of infection cost (survival or fecundity), and (c) spatial/temporal aspects of parasite transmission influence Evolutionarily Stable Strategies. The project will search for the parameter space that promotes evolution of migratory behaviors. The results will highlight certain regions of parameter space as deserving further exploration. This will suggest areas in which more detailed models, parameterized to a specific study system, will be especially useful. The results will also provide a set of theoretical hypotheses that can be tested using already available datasets."

Graphs and networks are widely used formats for representing data via edges that describe pairs of related objects. There is a growing need for efficient graph algorithms due to the abundance of large graphs in many of these domains. This project will study two important tools in the development of efficient graph algorithms: sparsification, which removes edges while preserving the overall structure of the graph, and preconditioned iterative methods, which improve the qualities of solutions. It will also support the development of courses that incorporate experimental aspects motivated by data science, the training of research-oriented students, and outreach activities based on algorithmic problem solving.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to extend key primitives for efficient algorithms on undirected graphs to directed graphs. Recent works hinted that two important tools for designing provably efficient algorithms on undirected graphs, sparsification and preconditioning, can be generalized to directed graphs when used in conjunction with each other. Studying these routines together enables a greater range of algorithmic flexibility: the construction of approximate graphs now only need to preserve solutions relevant to the convergence of the other loop, instead of for all possible inputs. The project will focus on extending this interplay between sparsification and preconditioning through better understanding of the underlying tools, iterative methods and concentration bounds. Progress on these tools can in turn lead to improvements on fundamental problems in graph algorithms such as computing directed random walks, finding maximum matchings on dense bipartite graphs, and maintaining large matchings on dynamically changing graphs."

The objectives of the learning community are to promote interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving, decrease student mathematics anxiety, encourage students to pursue STEM coursework, and increase student self-efficacy and persistence in STEM.

Conversely, researchers postulate that the number of STEM students who switch to non-STEM disciplines will be reduced among participants in the small learning communities, and the level of math anxiety will significantly decrease upon completion of the integrated course.  The researchers will develop the course materials for intrusive learning and the survey to measure the support system in the Performance Pyramid model.

Often individual tools are used without much guidance on how they fit in the big picture, and questions about best practices abound in online forums. However, existing answers are typically generic rules of thumb or dated advice, mostly based on third-party experiences, often non-applicable to the specific context.

Its presence in food can interfere with the adsorption of nutrients in the digestive track of many animals, including pigs and chickens. As a result, proteins and vital metal ions present in the animals' feed are rendered unavailable, causing an enormous loss in efficiency in the meat products made from these animals. With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul S. Cremer at the Pennsylvania State University is studying phytate and similar anions (molecules with extra negative charge) to understand their interactions with metal ions and to learn how these highly negatively charged species cause the precipitation of proteins and other large molecules from water solutions. This work not only helps shed light on how livestock feed can be used more efficiently, but also helps train graduate and undergraduate students in the chemical sciences. Simplified versions of these studies are being used as a springboard to update the curriculum and laboratories used to teach high school students about intermolecular forces and non-covalent interactions. <br/><br/>The Cremer group is exploring interactions between phytate and divalent metal cations in aqueous solutions. The interactions between various cations and individual phosphate groups are often similar, but this changes markedly when metal ions interact simultaneously with multiple phosphate groups, where the ions can bridge adjacent phosphate moieties. The thermodynamics of ion binding is being correlated with information on the polyanion's hydration shell that can be obtained by Raman and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. Such studies are also being extended to understand how ion binding and hydration water structures affect the salting out of proteins and polypeptides from aqueous solutions as a function of pH, salt concentration, and specific cation identity. In addition to phytate, which contains six phosphate groups around an inositol ring, studies are being performed with one through five phosphate groups placed around the ring with specific stereochemistry. Measurements are also being made with phosphatidylinositol lipids in planar membrane formats to elucidate the difference in binding behavior of polyphosphate groups bound to surfaces and those in bulk solution."

Available techniques often either neglect temporal dependencies for such high-dimensional data arising from multiple sources or do not apply to situations when the number of sources is large. This research project aims to develop novel statistical modeling tools that can capture adequately both the temporal features of such data and also their dependencies across multiple sources. Such tools have the potential to greatly enhance knowledge gained from such data. With fMRI data, for example, proper accounting for temporal dependence and large number of brain regions may facilitate better distinction among various clinical categories (ADHD, autism, etc.). Understanding the temporal and spatial dependencies in wave height data can lead to better predictions of storm activity across the oceans, and further insight into economic activity is expected from improved analysis of multiple economic indicators.<br/><br/>The project aims at developing an integrated approach to analyzing large multidimensional time series data, including their statistical models, estimation, computation (algorithms), and practice. The research covers both short-range and long-range dependent multidimensional time series. For short-range dependent series, the focus is on sparse vector autoregressive and related models, dimension reduction, change point detection and some nonlinear models. The problems to be addressed concern regularization techniques, statistical significance, models exhibiting cyclical variations and other issues. Multidimensional long-range dependence is suggested as the important class complementing vector autoregressive and related short-range dependent series, thus gathering the two general classes of models employed in modern time series analysis. The goal is to develop a new methodology for multidimensional long-range dependent series with the so-called general phase, which controls the symmetry properties of multidimensional time series, in both linear and nonlinear settings. The developed methods should be useful across a wide range of areas, including neuroscience, oceanography and environmental sciences, geophysics, economics and finance, and others."

These modules follow an explicit learning trajectory in which a video clip is used in the middle of an online teacher learning experience composed of mathematical problem solving, video analysis of classroom practice, and pedagogical reflection. Within each module activity, a teacher experiences a consistent set of activities. Before and after teachers watch each video clip, they engage in activities designed to immerse them deeply in both the mathematics content and the focal instructional components. The study has the potential to advance the knowledge of the use of educational data mining into the research and development of teacher education materials. In researching both the design and impact of the materials this project may offer implications for others interested in designing online professional development and teacher education materials. The Discovery Research preK-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The professional development is rooted in refining and consistently examining best practices in developing the teacher materials. The study investigates the design and impact of the materials which can support others who are interested in designing digital professional development. The project will employ the use of data analytics to discover what video-based modules users choose to use first, the sequence in which they use the modules, and the modules they don't choose. The modules will include three delivery formats to meet the variety of teacher learning needs (individual self-paced, group-paced, facilitated/structured course) and offer flexible pathways and sequences of multiple modules for professional development providers and teacher educators to use in their own contexts. Moreover, the project includes a plan to make the modules available through open access for professional developers and educators. The project contains a robust plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the professional development. In Year 3, a randomized controlled trial pilot efficacy study is planned to address the impact of teachers' participation in the group-paced delivery and facilitated course form format on their mathematics knowledge for teaching and teaching practice as well as the overall impact on their students' performance. The project has a strong focus on the practical problem of supporting teachers' knowledge of linear functions, expressions, and equations as well as how various representations are connected and linked."

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal."

By developing novel approaches to recyclable polymers/plastics that are affordable and sustainable, this project aims to benefit society by significantly (1) reducing the environmental damage caused by using non-sustainable plastics, (2) reducing the cost of consumer products in many different markets, and (3) decreasing the amount of waste for which agricultural companies and petroleum refineries pay for disposal.  K-12 teachers are offered opportunities to learn about sustainable chemistry to use in lessons in K-12 science classes.  To increase participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, this project provides research opportunities to technical and predominantly undergraduate college students and educational activities to engage underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students.<br/><br/>Polymeric organic and inorganic wastes (POIWs) generated by agricultural and petroleum refining processes have been explored as additives for conventional construction materials, but such products are merely physically blended materials, which are inherently prone to multiple, inescapable environmental deterioration pathways, including fragmentation, leaching, corrosion, and biological degradation.  This research is developing chemistry to form covalent bonds between these POIWs and the components of traditional macromolecular compounds to confer upon them significantly greater strength and environmental durability.  The objective is being pursued by covalently crosslinking agricultural waste-derived polymeric materials (such as lignocellulosic materials) with petroleum refining waste-derived materials (e.g., sulfur)."

This project will investigate interactions between planktonic grazers and marine aggregates - sinking particles that form in the surface ocean and have been shown to play an important role in marine food webs. The small scale of these biological processes makes them particularly challenging to study, but modern advances in mathematics and computer science have made direct observations of these interactions feasible. Experiments using high-resolution imaging will provide direct visual observations of zooplankton ingestion and the alteration of marine aggregates. These laboratory studies will guide the development of mathematical models to examine how these interactions affect particulate carbon sinking out of the surface ocean. This project will support an educational initiative focused on training undergraduate biology students in mathematical and computational techniques. This initiative includes the development of new interdisciplinary courses and undergraduate-focused independent research projects to help prepare the next generation of scientists in quantitative techniques that are essential to tackling the most challenging and complex biological problems. <br/><br/>Marine snow aggregates are particles that form in the surface ocean from organic and inorganic matter. These aggregates play a fundamental role in the biological pump, as sinking particles are a dominant contributor to the downward transfer of carbon in the ocean. However, much of the small-scale processes governing these particles and their role in the marine carbon cycle are still unknown. The goal of this project is to use mathematical and computational techniques to investigate interactions between aggregates and planktonic grazers, an understudied link in the planktonic food web that has important implications for carbon export. Three-dimensional trajectories of copepods within marine snow thin layers will be obtained to experimentally investigate copepod foraging behavior in response to patchy distributions of marine snow. In addition, high-speed imaging will allow for the direct observation of how copepods manipulate and ingest marine snow aggregates, thus affecting their size and settling velocity. Lastly, a mathematical model will be developed to study the impact of these small-scale interactions on large-scale carbon cycling and export. This project will also support the implementation of a comprehensive education plan focused on teaching undergraduate students how mathematical modeling and computational techniques can be used to address biological questions. This educational objective will be accomplished through the development of new courses in mathematical and computational biology and through the inclusion of undergraduate students in independent research projects."

The intervention incorporates small in-class collaborative projects to inspire students' interest in learning new theory and to train students in the design process. The researchers will leverage the Robotics Clinics learning environment at Bowie State to understand why the intervention is effective and to generalize the innovative teaching practice to the broader STEM education community, particularly minority serving institutions. <br/><br/>The researchers propose to investigate two research questions in two phases. The research questions are what are the learning characteristics of minority freshmen in STEM, and how do various features in collaborative learning and group dynamics influence the development of efficacy. In the first phase, the investigators will collect and analyze survey data of students enrolled in the Robotics Clinic freshman seminar courses using a social constructivist framework. They will then conduct a learner and contextual analysis to study the influences of learner characteristics and group differences. In the second phase, the investigators will use the results of the first phase to design and test the effectiveness of the evidence-based instructional system in fostering self-efficacy. The researchers will assess the impact of the project on faculty through surveys, focus groups, and self-reported anecdotes. The project is expected to produce a measure to evaluate the developmental impacts of the collaborative learning strategy on learning outcomes, to articulate an effective instructional system that integrates community inquiry, and to indirectly enhance the training of STEM faculty in educational research."

In order to get the best science from these observations, two types of additional, supporting observations will also be used: observations that have been made using different telescopes and instruments in the past, and observations that will be made with other telescopes and instruments in the future.  For all of these supporting observations to be useful, they must be as accurate as the observations that will be taken using the LSST.  For this project, the astronomers will calibrate the telescopes, instruments, and sky conditions of the observatories where the other observations are or will be made.  This project serves the national interest, as it ensures that the data acquired with the new telescope will contribute the best scientific results possible, promoting the progress of observational astronomy.  The astronomers are from Texas A & M University, which draws most of its students from a heavily Hispanic population.  The investigators intend to employ two graduate students and 8 - 10 undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project will produce an enormous amount of photometric data that will revolutionize the field of astronomy.  One of the LSST goals is to provide an unprecedented level of photometric accuracy: <0.5%.  Existing and on-going data from other telescopes will be used for comparison and follow-up observations with the new LSST observations.  These observations, however, will need to be very well calibrated.  The investigators will use existing equipment to provide accurate spectrophotometric calibration of imaging systems at observatories around the world.  The calibration will include in-situ measurements of the telescopes, optics, filters, and detectors, providing detailed knowledge of the transmission profiles of the instruments.  The atmospheric transmission above the observatory sites will also be measured.  Together, these measurements will help to enable exceptionally accurate photometric calibration of these systems.  Based on similar measurements of the DECam instrument and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory location, the investigators estimate that the proposed work should allow for accuracy of ~0.2% across large surveys and all spectral bands."

Second, the project will investigate the connections between set theory and an abstract view of model theory. Many assertions in model theory turn out to have set theoretic content, and the investigator will pursue the question of when there is such a connection and when there is not. Third, the project will explore the relatively recent field of descriptive graph combinatorics and its connections with classical questions in geometry and measure theory. <br/><br/>From infinitary combinatorics, the project will focus on the tree property, which is a compactness principle that abstracts the Konig infinity lemma to higher cardinals. A specific goal of the project is to explore the conjecture that modulo the consistency of large cardinals the least uncountable cardinal is the only cardinal which provably carries a counterexample to the tree property. The project will also pursue other similar questions. From model theory, the investigator will study model theoretic notions connected to the classification theory of abstract elementary classes and their set theoretic content. Particular properties of interest are tameness and locality, categoricity, and Hanf numbers. From descriptive graph combinatorics, the investigator will explore matchings and colorings in definable graphs. This study has already been shown to have interesting connections with questions in geometry, for example Marczewski's question about whether the Banach-Tarski paradox is possible using Baire measurable pieces."

The symposium focuses on the ways that people may or may not use technology. The extent to which people trust hardware and software platforms, and the people and organizations with whom they interact, influences their use and misuse. Trust can influence whether people may use reliable technologies, but also can lead to cybersecurity breaches and other detrimental outcomes. This symposium will focus on the psychological and sociological dimensions of trust and the linkages of trust to security, privacy and trustworthy systems. <br/><br/>Trust plays a key role in determining whether humans will rely on technology. What facilitates trust calibration and reliance? Over or under trusting technology can have dire consequences, including cybersecurity breaches and accidents, loss of data including identity data, and intrusions on privacy. This symposium addresses a gap between basic research on the predictors and consequences of trust as manifested in cyberspace. There will be both theoretical and practical foci. The focus on theory will include presentations and discussions of new models for understanding when people trust information, organizations, and artifacts online as well as contexts that moderate these phenomena. The focus on practical application will include presentations and discussions of vulnerabilities to abuses of trust. Four keynotes will be invited to present with an estimated 80 attendees, at this symposium to be held at UC Berkeley. The implications include arriving at a better understanding of whether or when people would be willing to allow machines to manage their security or to assist with their daily routines such as driving cars. Cybersecurity institutions, companies trying to market new technology to users, and government officials trying to prevent hacking are constituencies that will find this topic informative and useful. Moreover, as the human-technology frontier continues to expand, this topic of this symposium will have continued relevance for U.S. productivity, well-being, and security."

Highly trained postdoc scientists are employed to manually convert them. By one estimate, one year's worth of English biomedical journal publications alone would take a full-time postdoc over 30 years to convert. This manual process is fundamentally problematics for three reasons: First, it does not stop the continued publication of character descriptions in the legacy format. Second, it takes time away from highly trained scientists and preventing them from making new and more important discoveries. Third, it does not address the fundamental causes of large differences (~ 40%)  in the data converted by different scientists, resulting in less useful data. This project will investigate a transformative approach that solves the problem at its root, by enabling authors of biodiversity works to directly produce computable data at the time of publication, eliminating the need for subsequent post-publication data conversion. Scientists will be able to direct use the published data in the new format to address grand conservation, environmental, or medical challenges facing humankind today.    <br/><br/>This research has great potential to solve the phenotype data production problem at its root. It recognizes that authors make (implicit) ontological commitments when writing a descriptive work and that they are best qualified to interpret the work. Instead of limiting authors to any ""standardized"" terminology, authors will be provided with a low-barrier, efficient, open-collaboration platform to describe characters as accurately as they wish using an ontology built collectively with other authors working on similar taxa. This process makes authors more aware of term usage in the community and helps the community (including younger generation of scientists) converge on best practices. The result will be that all character terms included in the descriptive work are documented/defined in the taxon-specific ontology and the descriptions are consequently made semantically clear, and ready for software to harvest computable character data. The software platform to be developed by this project exposes disagreements among authors and usage-based term status in the ontology, and notifies authors of updates and conflicts via a mobile-friendly app. Taking into account user motivation and attribution factors, the project will design, implement, and evaluate the approach from both human social behavior and software usability perspectives, employing recent results from open online collaboration research and cutting-edge usability test techniques (e.g., measuring user stress levels via eye-tracking and pupil dilation). The success of the project is generalizable to other domains and will fundamentally change the way phenotypic characters are documented and used in biological research.

General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity; in this theory the effects of gravity are due to the curvature of the universe. The gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.  In very general terms, this project is concerned with the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and light cones).<br/> <br/>An initial data set in a spacetime consists of a smooth spacelike hypersurface, its induced metric and second fundamental form.  The principal investigator (PI) will continue his investigations concerning asyptotically flat initial data sets with horizons.  Such initial data sets model isolated gravitating systems with black holes.  In this context the PI, with various collaborators, has established results on 'topological censorship' at the initial data level, for initial data sets in three and higher dimensions.  These results establish, under natural physical assumptions, restrictions on the geometry and topology of the spatial domain of outer communication in black hole spacetimes. They rest in large measure on the rather recently developed theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs).  These are objects of considerable interest.   On the one hand they play an important role in the theory of black holes, and on the other, they may be viewed as natural spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry.  Although MOTS are not in general variational objects, they nevertheless turn out to have properties remarkably similar to minimal surfaces.   The work of the PI, and related results, lead to many interesting open problems that the PI will investigate, including problems concerning the topology of MOTSs and the spatial domain of outer communication, as well as problems concerning MOTS existence and rigidity phenomena, both in the compact and noncompact case.  Topological issues will benefit from a deeper understanding of the relationship between MOTSs and so-called immersed MOTSs.  The PI will also work on some problems pertaining to `time-symmetric'  (i.e., totally geodesic) initial data sets.  The PI will implement a strategy for proving a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds, in the spirit of the Schoen-Yau positive mass proof in the asymptotically Euclidean case. The research has the potential to close a gap in previous positive mass proofs in the AH case.  A further aim in this direction would then be to try to use this method to obtain a proof of the Horowitz-Myers conjecture concerning the AdS soliton.  The PI will also continue on-going projects involving photon spheres and spacetime rigidity problems."

However, the vitality of these languages is threatened, making the documentation and maintenance of surviving Native languages all the more pressing. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. The opportunity to document the speech used in oral traditions and the verbal arts for Native American languages is urgent, especially when this occurs in communities where the language retains considerable vitality and is still used extensively by speakers.  This project will document oral traditions, and cultural and ethnohistorical knowledge where the indigenous language usage and speakers' traditional knowledge are very strong.  The documentation will form the core material analyzed in a doctoral dissertation produced by the CoPI.  Broader impacts include a publicly available deposit of the recordings and transcriptions at the California Language Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, and the uses of this material by the tribe to support language revitalization and educational activities in culture, history and related areas.<br/><br/>The Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Reservation is an isolated Native community situated across the Nevada-Oregon border, formed when the Atsak&#616;da kwa N&#616;m&#616; (the people of the Red Mountain), were joined by families from neighboring areas looking for a Paiute safe haven as Euro-American settlers expanded settlements westward. Northern Paiute, a member of the Uto-Aztecan language family, is used extensively in this community by about three hundred speakers.  This project will record the Northern Paiute language in both casual and formal speech. It will also document Paiute perspectives on past events as well as more distant collective history for the community, examining how oral traditions are used, and performed, as well as how they contrast with the Euro-American historical discourse. Native American languages differ in their linguistic and information structure from Indo-European languages like English.  As a result, documenting Native American cultures requires serious attention to not only the structure of these languages, but also to the performance of verbal arts and how grammatical structures interact to express historical and other knowledge. The CoPI, a doctoral student at Indiana University, will analyze the documentation to explore how oral traditions in Northern Paiute are performed.  The analysis will include how meaning is expressed in both the physical body in performance and via the grammar through instrumental prefixes, morphemes referring to gestures or parts of the body. Elicitation strategies range from videorecording of an annual storytelling festival (started in 2016), the use of focus groups in which people come together and discuss specific topics of the history of the community, and interviews and field trips to places of relevance to the community's collective history.  By transcribing, analyzing, and translating Northern Paiute texts, the project will expand the linguistic, cultural, and historic record for the community and for researchers in history, anthropology, and folklore, as well as other allied disciplines."

As concern over this discovery grew, other communities began testing their water for PFOA. As of October 2016, PFOA has been discovered in unsafe concentrations in the groundwater of Eagle Bridge and Petersburgh, NY, Merrimack, NH, and in Bennington, North Bennington, and Pownal, VT. In response, select science courses at Bennington College and Union College will be redesigned in conversation with this unfolding contamination event. In these courses, undergraduate students will be trained in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies and equipped to apply that training in the production of independent data on a disaster in real-time. The project will craft new curriculum and teaching modules aimed at incorporating local environmental problems into science curriculum, as well as new methods for assessing the educational impact of doing so.  The educational data produced by this project promises to inform and improve existing science curriculum at Bennington College and Union College as well as offer insights about what works in STEM education on a liberal arts campus more generally. This project will also produce key data on changing levels of PFOA in groundwater and regional soils that will provide a much-needed independent characterization of the contamination plume. This project, then, will showcase the civic value of an education in science for diverse undergraduate students and the local community.<br/><br/>The guiding educational research question of this project is: How can environmental research on a local public crisis enhance the STEM curriculum for undergraduate students? Specifically, this project willexamine how training students in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology and equipping them to apply those discipline-based skills to help produce key data on a local crisis will influence student enrollment, fluency, retention, and vocational orientation in STEM fields. The researchers hypothesize that hands-on experience in meaningful environmental research will demonstrate the value of STEM fields in a liberal arts education and enhance student outcomes within STEM for both STEM and non-STEM majors. To evaluate this hypothesis, this project will produce data on changes in student attitudes towards and aptitude in chemistry, geology, and environmental studies while those students participate in environmental research on a nearby water contamination issue. Education assessment scholars will collaborate with project personnel to calibrate proven education assessment tools to this project. These evaluation tools include: pre- and post- assessments of discipline-specific knowledge, reflective prompts in Assessment Tools in Informal Science (ATIS) geared towards measuring students' beliefs about and understandings of science, and the Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) survey. This project will also develop a reflexive infrastructure of assessment designed to monitor the entire learning experience of students in these classes and incorporate preliminary findings into the overall pedagogy of the project. Together, these education assessment tools and methods will enable us to evaluate students' mastery of disciplinary concepts and skills through practical application and exams as well as through self-assessments embedded in surveys, class discussions, and reflective writing exercises."

Despite their success, major gaps remain in our understanding of how genetic changes affect phenotype. These gaps, coupled with advances in high-throughput technologies to measure genetic variation, have motivated GWAS of increasingly larger scale. However, the statistical and computational challenges posed by the scale and complexity of these studies present a critical bottleneck in realizing their promise.  These recent advances in scalable ML provide the potential for paradigm-shifting advances in the field of GWAS. However, these concepts have yet to be rigorously explored in the context of the GWAS modeling and testing problems. Exploring the intersection of these domains introduces fundamentally new statistical and computational challenges. The team will develop a suite of modeling and testing methods that target massive modern genomics datasets. The techniques that we will build upon include low-rank matrix approximation, kernel methods and matrix completion. They will also provide open-source software tailored to parallel and distributed computing environments to facilitate wide-spread adoption of methods.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Exploring GWAS through the lens of scalable machine learning introduces several research directions and requires the development of novel algorithms and analyses. Firstly, the focus of much scalable ML research has been on the statistical task of prediction, while GWAS inference problems also emphasize hypothesis testing and parameter estimation. Characterizing the behavior of scalable ML methods in these novel settings is a challenging open problem. The team will develop principled GWAS modeling and testing methods. The results to also be of great interest to the scalable ML community. Secondly, while scalable ML techniques are designed to be general purpose and domain-agnostic, the GWAS setting introduces rich biologically-motivated domain knowledge that needs to be leveraged to improve the quality of inference. Statistical models that are able to encode this prior knowledge while still permitting efficient inference will be developed. Ultimately the algorithms will be implemented as efficient parallel and distributed algorithms for these core modeling and testing problems, and develop robust open-source implementations that leverage modern computing infrastructure.1The proposed methods will dramatically improve the scalability of current GWAS analyses, on the one hand, while enabling the development of increasingly realistic genomic models, on the other. Collaborations and open-source artifacts will enable the wide-spread adoption of these methods by the human genetics community. This project will lead to a closer interaction of the genomics and machine learning communities at UCLA and outside."

Haskell is used by researchers and programmers in industry to build a variety of software  systems, such as financial analysis tools, interactive websites, data visualizations, and automated vehicle software. Dependent types are an up-and-coming technology that allows programmers to avoid bugs in their software, allowing them to include mathematical proofs of correctness in their code. These proofs are checked before the software ever runs, ruling out the possibility of failures, such as a crashed website. The intellectual merits are insights into the integration of advanced mathematical theories with an industrial-strength development tool (Haskell) and a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles that underlie the creation of correct software. The project's broader significance and importance are to give the technology industry access to dependent types for the first time, while creating opportunities for students (including those at one principal investigator's undergraduate women's college) to engage with this technology.<br/><br/>The project includes both practical and foundational components. The  Haskell type system, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) version 8.0, is able to simulate dependent types through the use of many language extensions. However, this use requires awkward encodings, and the extensions that support them complicate the language. In contrast, the Haskell type system envisioned by this project is based on a uniform approach to dependently typed programming that subsumes prior extensions. Part of this project involves replacing the core language of GHC with one based on dependent type theory, using relevance annotations to ensure that these extensions are backwards compatible. Furthermore, the project also introduces matchable functions, a qualifier that determines whether function applications can be analyzed via pattern matching, enabling the integration of dependent types with GHC's current type inference algorithm.  Finally, this project includes an examination of the semantics of dependently typed programming languages with partiality."

Ecological disturbances often favor growth of cyanobacteria because of their capability to adapt to rapid changes in the environment. Sometimes changes in environmental conditions can result in dense populations of cyanobacteria, (algal bloom) and they may also produce high concentrations of toxins (cyanotoxins) that kill fish and are a hazard to humans. The goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to test whether cyanotoxins have an important alternative biochemical and ecological function, namely, to protect the cyanobacteria by removing hydrogen peroxide. If this proves to be true, it would transform our understanding of the structure and function of freshwater lakes.  The results from this EAGER project may also lead to more effective and economical management of harmful cyanobacerial blooms. Cyanotoxins released during harmful algal blooms can pose health risks, and require millions of dollars to decontaminate freshwater supplies.

Cyanobacteria were the first lineage to establish oxygen-producing photosynthesis. Cyanobacterial photosynthesis captures solar energy, but it comes at the risk of producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. The development of a cellular process capable of handling intracellular reactive oxygen molecules was key to the evolution of cyanobacterial photosynthesis. This EAGER project will test an intriguing hypothesis about why cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins, that they function to sequester hydrogen peroxide, or otherwise convert it to a non-reactive form. In this project, toxic and non-toxic cyanobacterial strains will be compared with respect to hydrogen peroxide production. A new hydrogen peroxide microsensor will be used to examine the microscale distribution of hydrogen peroxide in thin surface lake water to determine whether (consistent with the hypothesis) it is inversely proportional with the abundance of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Finally, studies will determine whether the ability to isolate and grow novel cyanobacteria in culture can be improved by adding alpha-keto acids to scavenge any hydrogen peroxide produced by cells."

The migration can restore normal function of damaged tissue, as in wound repair, or further the spread of disease, as in a spreading cancer. In both wound healing and cancer, it is typical for cells to migrate together where each cell's motion depends its own active contractile forces and its interaction with neighbors. The resulting cellular motions can vary dramatically--from a solid-like state, where each cell remains close to its neighbors, to a fluid-like state, where each cell freely migrates past its neighbors. The transition between solid-like and fluid-like migration occurs in both wound healing and cancer invasion and its causes remain unclear. Theoretical models have predicted that the transition depends on the adhesion molecules between neighboring cells, and, counterintuitively, that greater adhesion causes a more fluid-like behavior.  This prediction is complicated by the fact that some molecules associated with cell-cell adhesion also cause cells to contract and pull against their neighbors. The work will experimentally examine the competing roles of adhesion and contraction on collective migration, thereby clarifying our understanding of collective migration and providing new insights into how the migration may be promoted in wound healing or reduced during cancer progression.  The PI will recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering through the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program in the College of Engineering at UW-Madison. Through the SURE program, these students will gain research experience and will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies.<br/><br/>This research will test the hypothesis that the solid-to-fluid transition results from a balance between the active contractile tension inside each cell and the adhesive surface energy at each cell-cell interface. To quantify intercellular adhesion, this project will use a mechanically rigorous definition, the surface tension. To quantify contraction, it will use the contractile stress within each cell. Surface tension and contractile stress will be modulated by using pharmacological inhibitors and transfections of appropriate signaling pathways, and they will be measured by using state-of-the art optical microscopy and quantitative image analysis. The first objective of this research will reveal how the intracellular surface tension results from the balance between the actomyosin contraction in each cell's cortex and the adherens junctions at each cell-cell interface. The second objective will investigate how contractility and surface tension together regulate the multicellular motion. The resulting data will give a complete account of the mechanics of collective cellular motion, and thus they will provide an empirical basis for testing theories for the mechanisms of collective migration."

Another talk will discuss recent work on equivariance in Floer cohomology, a powerful tool that should have many concrete topological applications; among the participants are leaders from the well-developed field of equivariant symplectic topology, who can contribute ideas for such applications. Higher-dimensional gauge theory is another subject that, following recent breakthroughs, seems ready for wider developments.

Cluster algebras and the combinatorics underlying them were discovered only relatively recently, but their importance for application in other areas of mathematics and physics is becoming increasingly apparent.

The main tools come from combinatorics, including combinatorial topology, the machinery of quiver mutations, symmetric functions and Young tableaux, and combinatorial ring theory. Cluster algebras, and the combinatorics of quiver mutations underlying them, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines including representation theory, Teichmller theory, mathematical physics, and enumerative and geometric combinatorics. A new application of cluster theory to the study of isolated singularities of plane algebraic curves will be studied.

While one can try to directly model such systems on computers, their size and complexity often render such attempts fruitless. Instead, one can look for models of such systems that are complex enough to display all of the phenomena under study, yet simple enough to admit exact mathematical computation to probe that behavior. Integrable probability is the theory behind discovering and subsequently analyzing such models. This project seeks to unify the area and various recent breakthroughs and in so doing discover a host of new types of integrable probability systems, new tools for their analysis, and new large-scale universal phenomena.<br/><br/>Integrable probability is an area of research at the interface between probability, mathematical physics, and statistical physics on the one hand, and representation theory and integrable systems on the other. Integrable probabilistic systems are characterized by two properties: It is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the systems; and asymptotics of the systems, observables, and formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena and universality classes (containing more than just integrable examples). The discovery and analysis of integrable probabilistic systems hinges upon underlying algebraic structure. These integrable probabilistic systems can be viewed as projections of powerful objects whose origins lie in representation theory and integrable systems. There is a rich history of major breakthroughs in the study of integrable probabilistic systems, including the six-vertex model, Ising model, and more recently certain models in the KPZ universality class. The basic mechanisms at the heart of many of these existing results are Schur / Macdonald processes (built off the structure of symmetric polynomials) and quantum integrable systems (built off solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation and the Bethe ansatz). Each mechanism has produced breakthrough results, such as the recent resolution of the 25-year-old physics conjecture that the KPZ stochastic partial differential equation is in the KPZ universality class. Until recently, these two routes to integrable probability have existed relatively separately. The goal of the proposed project is to create a unified theory of integrable probability, combining and generalizing the methods of Schur / Macdonald processes and quantum integrable systems and, complementarily, extracting new analyzable models and uncovering new probabilistic or physical phenomena."

The combination of excellent performance and facile solution processing open new opportunities for low-cost high-performance electronic devices. While these materials have enjoyed extensive success for application in electronic devices, further improvement is limited in part by a lack of understanding of how to control the number of electrical carriers within the semiconductor (known as doping), which is a vital parameter for establishing device operation. By creating a broadly interdisciplinary project, employing both theory and experimental approaches, the current research seeks to develop a better understanding of doping processes for controlling the level of electrons/holes within this important class of halide perovskites. By achieving the goals of the project, novel designs of higher-efficiency solar cells and light-emitting devices, as well as higher-performance perovskite transistors are expected. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoc researchers play a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary project execution and the project therefore plays a vital role in training future scientists. As a GOALI project, a critical aspect involves broadening student experiences to include industrial research exposure, as well as creating a link to the world-leading materials characterization capabilities within industry. <br/><br/>Technical Description: Semiconductor doping using intrinsic/extrinsic crystalline defects establishes the energy levels and carrier densities that determine optoelectronic properties. High-performance photovoltaic materials, for example, rely on careful doping control to modify the electronic properties and improve the device performance to levels approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit. Although metal halide perovskites have received much attention recently, due to the exceptional rise in associated photovoltaic performance, the current understanding and exploration of doping in this class of complex ionic semiconductors remains limited. This project paves the way for more tunable functional halide perovskites by addressing important doping related questions, such as: (1) can the relatively 'soft' nature of metal halide perovskites create special challenges and opportunities for development of new doping pathways; (2) can the use of complexes rather than individual ions enhance doping tenability; and (3) what opportunity for molecular doping exist within the organic cation layer versus impurity doping within the metal halide framework? In order to develop this critical understanding, the project integrates academic and industrial research in materials synthesis, optoelectronic characterization and theory to investigate dopant incorporation and activation in perovskite semiconductors. The research consists of several thrusts, including: (1) theory/computation-guided development of new dopants and doping processes, (2) exploration of molecular dopants in hybrid perovskites, (3) manipulation of radiative recombination using doping and (4) application of unique electrical transport characterization tools, developed by the industrial partner, to understand doping in halide perovskites and also to provide a framework for future study of transport phenomena in complex materials."

In the recent past these fields were very important in several breakthroughs in mathematics. For example, methods from both geometric analysis and metric geometry were crucial for the proof of the famous Poincar conjecture, which goes back to the year 1900 and is the only one of the Millennium Prize problems to be solved to date.  These areas of mathematics also have many applications, for example to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big data analysis.  This funding will help to involve early-career mathematicians, including graduate students and postdocs. Special attention will be devoted to identifying and supporting women and other members of underrepresented groups.  There will be speaking opportunities for junior researchers and graduate students, as well as a full day of introductory talks with the goal of attracting a broader audience.  The conference will include speakers and participants who work in several research areas, thus further encouraging cross-collaborations.      <br/><br/>The conference will feature eleven plenary speakers with plenty of time between talks to encourage discussion and the interchange of ideas.

These quantum invariants have appeared not only in geometric analysis but also in low-dimensional topology, which studies three-dimensional space as well as four-dimensional space-time, and in certain models in high-energy physics.  The investigator will study fundamental questions about these quantum invariants, including their behavior under mathematical operations known as surgery and symmetry reduction.   Applications will be of interest in topology and physics. The investigator will also continue his outreach activities for middle-school geometry teachers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project studies the behavior of quantum invariants such as the Fukaya category and quantum K-theory under operations such as flips, blow-ups, and symplectic reduction.  In the first part of the project, the investigator will construct generators of the Fukaya category associated to surgeries on the symplectic manifold that arise naturally as the symplectic structure is varied.   Each of these gives rise to a collection of objects in the Fukaya category, and conjecturally a factor in the quantum cohomology.  The main technique here involves the Abouzaid-Ganatra generation criterion and a restricted version of symplectic field theory for the Fukaya category developed using stabilizing divisors.  In the second part of the project, the investigator and collaborators will construct a homotopy version of Kirwan's map from the quasimap Fukaya category of a Hamiltonian group action to the Fukaya category of the symplectic quotient.  This study will have applications to the disk potentials of Lagrangians in symplectic quotients.

Such construction problems arise not only in mathematics, but also in science, engineering, and medicine. Examples include identifying organs and tumors in the human body or designing the shapes of radar antennas or jet airplanes. The Brunn-Minkowski theory is at the heart of the mathematical and computational tools used in such applications. Central to the Brunn-Minkowski theory are isoperimetric inequalities, which express relationships between different types of geometric measurements (such as the surface area and volume) of a body, and Minkowski problems, which ask whether a shape can be reconstructed from a set of geometric measurements (such as the curvature of the boundary). The investigators will continue their work connecting ideas in information theory with Brunn-Minkowski theory. This work has generated interesting questions that are accessible to and can be explored by high school and undergraduate students. Graduate students also are involved in the research.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the research is to develop both extensions and duals of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory. In one project, the investigators aim to build upon prior results showing that, for each value of a real parameter p, there is an Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory. Just as the Minkowski problem for the surface area measure is a central focus of the classical Brunn-Minkowski theory, the Minkowski problem for Lp surface area measure is central to the Lp Brunn-Minkowski theory. While most work been limited to when the parameter p is greater than 1, the investigators and collaborator are exploring the singular case, when p is 0, and aim to extend the work to non-positive p.  A second project concerns analogues of Federer's curvature measures within the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. Surprisingly, this newly discovered family includes two already known but important cases: the cone-volume measure and Aleksandrov's integral curvature measure. For each such dual curvature measure, there is a corresponding dual Minkowski problem, which is a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation. The investigators aim to further explore the dual Minkowski problem.  A third project further investigates Lp analogues of Aleksandrov's integral curvature; the investigators aim to solve completely the Minkowski problems associated with these measures. The investigators will continue their efforts to extend previous work on the parallels between information theory and both the Lp and dual Brunn-Minkowski theories. The investigators will also continue their work toward establishing the log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality, which to date has been established only in the plane."

Under such conditions, first- and second-row (or low Z) elemental solids, while existing as simple molecular or elemental solids at ambient conditions, form unusual and highly dense network structures. These materials are extremely hard, have high energy density, and exhibit novel optical and electronic properties. These novel properties arise from collective behaviors of 3D network structures of low Z elements with high phonon frequencies, thermal conductivities, cohesive energies, and strong electron-phonon couplings. The structures and properties of these densely packed low Z solids, therefore, can be viewed as nature's windows to unexplored novel structures and properties beyond those of diamond and transition metal compounds. However, these materials are often formed at formidable pressures and may be unstable at normal conditions; only a few systems have been recovered, limiting the materials within a realm of fundamental scientific discoveries. Therefore, an exciting new research area has emerged on understanding and, ultimately, controlling the stability, bonding, structure, and properties of low Z extended solids.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project aims to develop multifunctional hybrid carbon/low-Z extended solids amenable to stabilization at ambient conditions via kinetically controlled processes in heterogeneous solid mixtures. State of the art dynamic-diamond anvil cell experiments coupled with time-resolved Raman and synchrotron X-ray characterization are used to probe metastable interfacial structures and exploit the presence of internal chemical pressure and dynamic shears, thereby lowering the external transition pressure while enhancing the miscibility between two dislike solids. Through scientific discoveries and innovative material developments, the project elucidates the fundamental principles of high-pressure chemistry and demonstrate the revolutionary capabilities of hybrid carbon/low Z framework materials for hydrogen storage, chemical energy depository, and nonlinear optical and electronic applications. The project also provides graduate and undergraduate students with significant hands-on opportunities to learn experimental technologies at our institution, at the synchrotron and neutron facilities, and in national laboratories. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of this effort, these students are gaining fundamental knowledge across many academic disciplines of solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials and planetary sciences."

Special efforts will be devoted to the joint learning of data of multiple modalities and extraction of latent structures with an adjustment for covariates. Target applications include image categorization and recommender systems, where the proposed techniques will be applied to understand the content of an image and to predict personalized preference over a large number of items.

Vast filaments of matter coalesce into galaxies under gravity.  However, unknown forces from within expel gas in the form of galactic winds.    Ruszkowski and collaborators seek to understand whether this missing force could be provided by cosmic rays.  Using computer simulations, they will study effects of cosmic rays on galactic winds.  They will determine whether cosmic rays contribute sufficient force to these winds to expel matter from galaxies completely.  Finally understanding what powers galactic winds will contribute a major advance.  This study may enable a qualitative leap in our understanding of how galaxies evolve.  Results of these simulations will be used in stunning planetarium animations.  Such visualizations engage the public and inspire young people to study science.<br/><br/>This study will probe a range of spatial scales.  It will include hybrid kinetic simulations of cosmic ray propagation around isolated supernova remnants out to galactic disks and finally to cosmological galaxy formation.  Cosmic-ray transport physics will be simulated from first principles.  Local patches of the interstellar medium will be simulated using adaptive mesh refinement.  These results in turn will be used to develop sub-grid models for galaxy and cosmological formation simulations.  This project will constitute the first large-scale study of galaxy formation to include cosmic-ray transport processes on all spatial scales.  It will yield specific predictions for the properties of cosmic-ray driven galactic winds."

With funding support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, this University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver) project will recruit thirty (30) science and mathematics majors, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM, to pursue secondary teaching licensure. Eligible students will receive up to $20,000 for one year of post-baccalaureate graduate study leading to licensure and an M.A. in Education. Among the project's recruitment strategies are paid internships for potential Noyce Scholars to participate in activities that expose and enhance interest in STEM educational activities in order to explore teaching as a possible career choice. Examples of potential internship activities include (but are not limited to): summer or academic year research experiences in a scientific laboratory or in science education, K-12 outreach activities (tutoring, after school STEM clubs, classroom helpers), tutoring in STEM bridge programs between high school and college, and serving as counselors in summer STEM camps. CU-Denver Noyce Scholars will obtain licensure through a student teacher residency program, where, four days a week, they will be immersed in a classroom setting with an exemplary teacher mentor from the partner high-need district, the Denver Public Schools (DPS). This will occur from the outset of their post-baccalaureate teacher licensure program. The course content that they would traditionally complete in the CU-Denver School of Education and Human Development will occur through a weekly seminar, occurring on the fifth day, coupled with online course offerings. <br/><br/>The student teacher residency model represents an evidence-based shift in the approach to teacher education. Results from this program in elementary teacher preparation at CU-Denver have demonstrated that classroom immersion, when it parallels coursework, enhances the contextual aspects of that coursework leading to better integration of educational theory and classroom practice. This project posits that this integration will be particularly beneficial to STEM teacher candidates, as the pedagogical content knowledge associated with mathematics and science is so deeply rooted in context, background, and instructional strategies. In order to promote greater efficacy in the classroom at the outset of their teaching careers, mentor teachers will be carefully selected and matched with the Noyce Scholars in order to create the best opportunities for learning. Teacher candidates in this program will also receive support from the contributions of the Noyce Mentor. As a master teacher with a STEM background, the Noyce Mentor will serve as a consistent mentor to the Noyce Scholars, from the beginning of their selection as Noyce Scholars and continuing through their induction year of actual teaching. The Noyce Mentor has proven to be an extremely successful support role for pre-service and novice teachers at CU-Denver at the elementary level. This project will also provide additional post-licensure induction support in the form of workshops. Research has shown that this type of support is critical in providing new teachers with early professional development strategies they need to be successful in the classroom. Research on induction support has also shown that it improves the likelihood that new teachers will stay in the profession beyond the five-year mark. Ultimately, this project's implementation of a STEM cohort in partnership with DPS's Residency Program coupled with STEM-focused induction support offers a strong model for other teacher preparation programs and for STEM recruitment and retention efforts in high-need districts."

Many students find chemistry a challenging subject as it is difficult to connect observed phenomena to the unseen behavior of atoms and molecules.  Practice making these connections is crucial to developing the reasoning skills needed for success in chemistry. This project will deliberately study how demonstration exercises can be transformed into active exercises that engage students in the reasoning process. Each exercise will take students through a structured process of predicting the outcome, observing the demonstration, and explaining what happened at the atomic level. Through repeated practice, students are expected to improve their scientific reasoning skills, and increase their engagement in chemistry.<br/><br/>The Chemical Demonstrations project will explore the efficacy of chemical demonstrations as a means to improve student learning, with particular attention to learning gains by under-prepared students. Although in-class demonstrations are used almost daily in most chemistry courses, they are rarely studied. Consequently, the learning that results from demonstrations has been questioned. The project will transform the common practice of show and tell demonstration to a formal predict-observe-explain (POE) format that engages students in reasoning that connects macroscopic observations to atomic and molecular explanations. A quasi-random experimental design will be used to compare increases in content learning and scientific reasoning skills. The POE demonstrations will be modular and easy to integrate into existing class sessions, allowing instructors to switch from traditional to evidence-based demonstrations with minimum effort. Since general chemistry is a gateway course for many STEM disciplines besides chemistry, this project will promote student success in STEM to a broad audience."

The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what shapes and forms complexity can take. <br/><br/>This project is part of an ongoing study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. In particular, the project will explore the connections between Vaught's conjecture and computability theory, and the generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture. A few years ago, connections between computable structure theory and Vaught's conjecture emerged unexpectedly.

The nanofabrication techniques must also be scalable in order to be seamlessly applied to real-world applications beyond the laboratory. Despite progress having been made, a versatile nanofabrication technology that can meets all necessary requirements is lacking. This research will open up a new nanomanufacturing process pathway that can be applied to speed-up laboratory and pilot-scale device development and also be scaled-up for large-area, high-throughput product manufacturing. This research will make significant impacts on the fields of nanotechnology, nanomanufacturing, plasmonics, optoelectronics and nanophotonics. Plans are for graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to receive training, participate in this highly interdisciplinary research and conduct experiments in the new Washington Clean Energy Testbeds facility.<br/><br/>Nanoimprint lithography is a simple, low-cost, high-resolution and high-throughput nanofabrication technique with compatibility for large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing. However, current roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography processes are all based on either thermal or ultraviolet-based curing techniques that require either high temperature or special photopolymer resists. In addition, roller molds are typically made by time-consuming and costly fabrication processes. The research team aims to design and develop a new roll-to-roll nanoimprint lithography process using environmentally friendly polymer resists and a high-resolution composite belt mold. The research is accomplished through fundamental understanding of mechanics and fluid dynamics of mold cavity filling under solvent-assisted conditions to produce quality nanostructures on large area flexible substrates with high resolution and high throughput. Solvent-assisted nanoimprinting offers a low temperature and low pressure process, which eliminates issues resulting from thermal expansion variations between the mold, substrate and resist and reduces energy input costs while increasing processing speed. New composite elastomeric belt molds are easily and affordably replicated for rapid prototyping while providing high-resolution. The high quality nanostructures on flexible substrates are fabricated using this method and integrated in to novel flexible optoelectronic devices to demonstrate its capabilities."

In this project, the investigator will study weighted bootstrap procedures in a high-dimensional framework with a limited amount of data, for various classes of statistical models. The main goals of this research are to understand essential properties of the weighted bootstrap, such as its limitations and accuracy, and to advance resampling methods in high-dimensional settings.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator will study the problem of approximation in distribution of a function of a sample average in a high-dimensional non-asymptotic framework, for various classes of functions. Two basic types of approximations, which are closely related to each other, will be studied: an approximation using the weighted bootstrap procedure, and Berry-Esseen type inequalities. In both cases, the investigator aims to establish higher-order approximation bounds that extend classical Gaussian approximation theory and yield considerable improvements in accuracy with respect to both dimension and sample size. The study will be focused on optimality of the resulting bounds, and on explicit form of the error terms. Another important direction of the research in this project is extension of the proposed higher-order approximation methodology to the case of heavy-tailed distributions, which play an important role in many applications in finance and engineering. The work on the project aims to employ and further develop various modern techniques, such as higher-order approximation and comparison inequalities, concentration inequalities for multilinear symmetric forms, geometric properties of Gaussian measures in high dimensions, and methods related to multivariate moment problems."

For this project, the investigators will build a large library of high-quality spectra for about 6000 stars using observations made on existing telescopes and instruments.  This project will serve the national interest as it promotes the progress of research in astronomy by providing high-quality standards for astronomers to use to do their research.

Theoretical stellar libraries are not yet realistic enough to match the observed colors of stars and galaxies; this reveals an incomplete understanding of important stellar physics.  To address these problems, the investigators will build a large, well-calibrated, high quality empirical stellar library of ~6000 stars with much more extensive coverage of stellar parameter space than previous efforts.  The spectra will cover the wavelength range of 3600-10,300 at a resolution of R~2000, with better than 3% relative flux calibration.

A ""geometric structure"" means a set of coordinate systems where the coordinates live in a space with a ""classical geometry:"" examples include Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, affine geometry or conformal geometry. Since the mid 19th century, considerations of symmetry emphasize the viewpoint that a classical geometry is just the study of properties which are unchanged under the transitive action of a Lie group.  Closely related is the importance of symmetry in modern physics, and many of objects in this investigation have physical motivations. Classification of geometric structures on a fixed topology means putting the more rigid geometric measurements on a loosely organized collection of points, which is the topology.  A simple example is the fact that the sphere cannot support  Euclidean geometry.  This is just the mathematical abstraction of the fact that there is no metrically accurate world atlas. At least one page of the world atlas will distort distance.   On the other hand the torus (the surface of a doughnut, bagel or inner tube) does admit Euclidean structures. In fact the different ways of putting Euclidean geometry on a torus has a rich geometry of its own. Technology plays a key tool both in this investigation and its dissemination to the public. Many mathematicians are involved in this project, including colleagues, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students and even high school students. The objects of study are often two- and three-dimensional and can be visualized with the use of computers. All the software developed in the project is publicly available and invites further education and experimentation in this research project.<br/><br/><br/>While the traditional methods of classification of geometric  structures involve a quotient space, frequently the moduli spaces are pathological. Simple examples lead to quotients of nice spaces by chaotic group actions. The PI adopts the viewpoint that classification of geometric structures is really a  dynamical system. Many well known interesting dynamical systems arise from this context. In particular the extension of the Teichmuller geodesic flow  to the universal character variety over the  Riemann moduli space has rich dynamics, impacting low-dimensional geometry, topology and mathematical physics.  The PI will study this dynamical system as the fusion of  the well-developed subject of Teichmuller dynamics and his previous work on mapping class group dynamics on character varieties and  moduli spaces of geometric structures."

Researchers have long studied the processes by which culture contact in colonial settings drives social and cultural shifts at the micro-scale, or household, level. It has often been assumed that social change stemming from colonial interaction, such as adopting new forms of household economic organization, spreads uniformly through indigenous societies. In recent years, scholars have placed increasing emphasis on understanding how individuals and social groups shaped their participation in large-scale social and economic trends initiated by high-status elites in unique and independent ways. This research focuses specifically on colonial-era Hawai'i, examining how groups in isolated areas of the island chain chose to accept, reject, or modify newly introduced household practices based on local needs and concerns. Investigating small-scale, local responses to ""top-down"" social forces will provide a better understanding of processes of social change in both ancient societies and in the present. Hawaiian and Hawai'i-based students will take part in all phases of work, offering crucial training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate archaeology students in both excavation and laboratory techniques. Such instruction will help increase the representation of Hawaiian archaeologists working in Hawai'i, an under-represented minority group in the field. William & Mary students will assist with the laboratory analysis phase, which will also provide an important opportunity for applied training in archaeological research techniques.  <br/><br/>This research will explore how inhabitants of remote, outlying regions under nominal colonial control responded to large-scale social transformations, as well as how these responses may have shifted through time. Using a theoretical framework highlighting the self-determination of local communities, this research focuses on three communities on the N Pali Coast of Kaua'i Island, Hawai'i, a remote region located far from Hawai'i's political centers. The N Pali Coast is separated from the rest of the island by high cliffs that restrict overland access to the region. Lying in an isolated region at the margins of the newly emerging Hawaiian Kingdom, these sites provide a unique case study to explore responses to nineteenth-century colonialism. This project uses multiple lines of evidence, including household archaeology and information from historical documents, to compare consumption practices on Kaua'i Island's remote N Pali Coast to patterns seen in more central parts of the archipelago. If early nineteenth-century N Pali Coast households did pursue distinctive economic strategies, it will be compelling evidence that nineteenth-century social and cultural transformations were not progressive and inevitable, as now understood, but instead subject to local negotiation and contestation. This research has implications for understanding local responses not only to European colonialism in the modern era but also to large-scale patterns of social change in historical contexts world-wide."

Synthetic chemistry is an underpinning in chemical science that enables advancements in society as related to developing new medicines (e.g. active pharmaceutics) and technologically-important materials (e.g. strong and lightweight).  This project will develop strategies to synthesize molecules in which chemical reactions are conducted in the solid state.  Whereas synthetic chemistry is typically performed in the liquid phase or solution, the solvent-free and ""frozen"" environment of the solid state provides opportunities to synthesize molecules with unique structures and properties.  Strategies to conduct reactions in organic solids can, thereby, accelerate progress of how synthetic chemistry defines and is applied to developments in society and technology. The project will integrate underrepresented groups, develop undergraduate laboratory experiments, and maintain active collaborations with undergraduate colleges.  The project will also introduce middle-school students to careers in chemical science (e.g. X-ray crystallography).<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project will increase the value of reactions conducted in solids by developing solid-state reactions that generate products with synthetically-valuable organic functional groups and/or are based on reduced symmetries.  The research will apply multi-component solids in the form of cocrystals and/or metal-organic materials to direct the solid-state reactions.  Specifically, (i) metal-organic solids will direct photodimerizations of imines that form cyclobutanes lined exclusively with aldehyde groups, (ii) cocrystals will direct photodimerizations that generate unsymmetrical ladderanes, and (iii) cocrystals will support cross-photocycloadditions.  The research is motivated by the fact that although multi-component solids are rapidly emerging as media to reliably control reactivity in solids relative to the liquid phase, important avenues of needed investigation based on forming products decorated with challenging organic functional groups and of reduced symmetry remain unaddressed.  When the proposed research is completed, it will be possible to more broadly apply reactions in solids to problems of organic synthesis (e.g. complex molecules), green chemistry (e.g. solvent-free preparation), inorganic chemistry (e.g. metal-organic reactivity), and materials science (e.g. single-crystal reactions)."

Two major sources of these questions are models of rotating stars and galaxies, and models of deep water waves in the ocean. The study of equilibrium shape and density distribution of rotating stars is a classical question in the history of mathematical physics. Early efforts beginning in the eighteenth century were devoted to finding ellipsoidal shapes with constant density. In the twentieth century, major progress was made by solving equations describing compressible fluids, thus allowing a more realistic model of stars with variable gaseous density. The mathematical method used to construct such solutions involves putting the same amount of gas in different shapes and density distributions, and finding one with the least physical energy. However, such a method only provides proof for existence of solutions, without delivering too much information on the shape of the star, or how the solution varies as the rotation speed of the star varies. In this project, the investigator aims to provide new existence proofs using a different method, which involves continuously deforming the shape of a round, non-rotating star to arrive at a rotating star solution. The new method is intended to return information about shape and dependence on rotation speed. For deep water waves, the investigator will study certain important model equations that describe internal waves below the ocean surface as well as spectacular phenomena in the atmosphere, such as the ""Morning Glory"" cloud seen in northeastern Australia. The internal waves described by such models have practical significance; for example, internal waves can interact with surface ocean waves to produce rogue waves that can damage or destroy ocean vessels or fixed structures.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project aims to prove existence of rotating star solutions to the Euler-Poisson and Vlasov-Poisson equations, using an implicit function theorem type perturbation technique. Apart from proving detailed analytical estimates involving spaces adapted to the problem, the investigator will need to study the linearized operator by proving a vanishing theorem about a certain integro-differential equation for functions in the kernel. The research will study continuation of the solution curve to faster rotation speed using topological degree arguments, and discover possible breakdown mechanisms of the solution curve. In addition, the investigator plans to examine the phenomenon of mass bound on rotating white dwarf solutions to the Euler-Poisson equations, using both variational methods and spectral analysis. For models involving deep water waves, the project will explore the completely integrable aspect of the Benjamin-Ono equation. Building on previous work, the investigator will study existence, uniqueness, and asymptotic properties of the Jost solutions proposed in the Fokas-Ablowitz inverse scattering transform. These questions are closely related to the continuous spectrum of certain singular integral perturbations of the derivative operator."

Fundamental questions to be addressed include: 1) How can the energy in a chemiluminescent excited state be efficiently transferred by through-space and through-bond energy transfer mechanisms to enhance luminescence emission? 2) What molecular structures will enable tuning of emission wavelengths for near-infrared and ratiometric readouts? 3) How can chemiluminescence emission be dynamically triggered with spatiotemporally controlled illumination to maximize signal to background in a region of interest?"

The symmetries of an object in nature or of a theoretical construct can be encoded by a group, which itself carries important information about the structure of the object. Representation theory allows one to study groups in a uniform way via their actions on vector spaces, which model common ways groups act in applications. Representation theory has been a central topic in mathematics for more than a century and has important applications in physics and chemistry, particularly in quantum mechanics and the theory of elementary particles. Finite groups and their representations have important applications in coding theory and cryptography, and play an important role in modern computation and digital communications. This project aims to advance understanding in the representation theory of finite groups and in a number of applications. <br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on several important questions in group representation theory and its applications. It ties together different areas of mathematics, such as finite groups and algebraic groups, permutation groups, probabilistic group theory, group cohomology, combinatorics, vertex operator algebras, and algebraic geometry, with representation theory as the main unifying ingredient. Many of the questions addressed in the project come up naturally in the study of group representations, and others are motivated by applications. The investigator will study several problems along the lines of the global-local principle, including conjectures of McKay, Alperin, Brauer, and others that extend and generalize classical results in the representation theory of finite groups. The investigator also intends to study classification of modular representations of low dimension and to develop a theory of character level, with the goal of establishing strong bounds on character values for finite quasisimple groups. It is anticipated that the results can be applied to study Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices and the Kollar-Larsen problem on exterior powers, Miyamoto's problem, problems on random walks and anti-concentration, representation varieties of Fuchsian groups, word map distributions and Waring-type problems for quasisimple groups, refinements of Holt's conjecture on second cohomology groups, and representations of quasisimple groups with special properties."

Many emerging liquid crystal applications, such as flat optical elements, stimuli-responsive materials and devices rely on spatially varying molecular orientations. As a result, scalable manufacturing techniques for patterning molecular orientations are in high demand. Recently a projection photopatterning technique using specially designed photomasks made of nanometer-sized rectangular holes in aluminum films was shown capable of photo-aligning molecular orientations into complex patterns, promising scalable manufacturing of various liquid crystal devices. However, this kind of metallic photomask suffers from low efficiency in optical transmission, especially for ultra-violet light. This award supports fundamental research to develop high efficiency photomasks by using nanostructures of dielectric materials, and facilitates practical deployment of this photopatterning technique in liquid crystal device manufacturing. The project studies photo-patterning of complex structures with ordered molecular orientations using ultra-violet light and the dielectric metamasks. The research is interdisciplinary, involving photomask design, numerical simulations, liquid crystal materials and devices, nanomanufacturing and optical characterization. The PI will leverage the research to educate graduate and undergraduate students with multidisciplinary knowledge and skills, and to enhance diversity and STEM education by involving minority and high-school students.<br/><br/>Plasmonic metamasks that can generate spatially-varying patterns of both light intensity and polarization direction have recently been suggested and utilized for photoaligning molecular orientations into complex spatially varying patterns. One issue with the plasmonic metamasks is that Ohmic losses in plasmonic materials make the optical transmission low. This project aims to eliminate this limit by developing dielectric metamasks. This research includes simulation, fabrication and characterization of dielectric metamasks with designable polarization patterns and high optical transmission in ultra-violet and near ultra-violet wavelength ranges; building of an optical photopatterning system; and designing, fabrication and characterization of Pancharatnam-Berry microlens arrays and mirrors as testbeds. The research advances basic understanding and new knowledge on designing dielectric metamasks and capabilities in scalable fabrication of liquid crystal devices such as geometric phase optical elements. Success of this project is expected to increase spatial resolution and throughput of the metamask-based photopatterning technique. The research outcomes should enrich the nanomanufacturing toolbox and facilitate practical applications of Pancharatnam-Berry flat optical elements."

In recent years, organic and mixed organic-aqueous liquids have garnered increased interest as an alternative solvent for the preparation of crystalline materials and separation (or purification) by crystallization, in particular for high-value materials such as pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. In contrast to crystallization from aqueous solvents, the level of understanding of the fundamental processes of crystal growth from organic solvents is severely limited. The lack of insight into the relevant fundamental mechanisms and pathways has emerged as the main obstacle to a rational approach to the optimization and control of crystallization in organic and mixed organic-aqueous media. The objective of this project is to provide understanding of the molecular processes comprising crystallization from mixed solvents focusing on the thermodynamic and kinetic consequences of potential solvent structuring.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The roles that organic and mixed solvents play in crystallization are the open question addressed in this project. The solvent structures at the crystal-solution interface are characterized by advanced atomic force microscopy imaging and correlated with their effects on the thermodynamics of crystallization. How the chemical properties of the solvent affect the crystallization mechanism is elucidated by determining the steps that a solute molecule takes en route to a crystal growth site. The nature of the activation barrier for incorporation of molecules into the crystal is elucidated to establish whether solvent structuring and interactions with solvent molecules are the primary mechanisms underlying the existence of this barrier. Determining the steps in the molecular mechanism and their respective governing parameters provides tools to optimize and control crystallization from organic and mixed solvents and suppress defect-inducing instabilities. Comparing data for several porphyrin-solvent pairs elucidates the roles of the chemical moieties in the solvents and their abilities to form hydrogen and van der Waals bonds in the formation of solvent structures. Untangling the interlaced chemical and physical processes comprising crystallization and identifying the relevant governing parameters represents a new paradigm in the rational design of organic crystals."

As a result, numerous first-year programs, courses, and experiences exist, with new ones created each year. While first-year engineering education is heavily dependent on the history, design, and political structure of the host institution, it remains important to use research results to inform the creation and alteration of the first-year engineering courses, programs, and experiences. Recent research investigations have generated knowledge of the differences in course structure and content if first-year engineering courses. However, faculty and administrators designing first-year engineering education commonly ask questions that are not addressed by current literature, such as ""Is it better for students to have a common first-year experience or one that is discipline specific?"" or ""Should transfer students have a different course than freshmen?""  While it is likely that neither is better or worse, there are differences that must be investigated so faculty and administrators can make informed decisions regarding changes to first-year engineering education to enhance the student experience for all. This study intends to clarify how first-year engineering structure (e.g., common engineering, discipline specific), content (e.g., design, problem solving, academic success), and timing (e.g., one or two semesters) help or hinder students pursuing a variety of engineering pathways.<br/><br/>Through a three-phase exploratory qualitative case study employing individual interviews and focus groups, this study attempts to answer the research question: how do students who are pursuing engineering degrees through pathways that vary with respect to first-year engineering structure, content, and timing describe their experience participating in engineering communities of practice and their emerging engineering identities? Through the community of practice framework, this research determines what communities of practice are formed during first-year engineering and their relation to engineering identity in diverse first-year engineering experiences. The researchers are evaluating the differences in student development through the various experiences, focusing on the impacts of structure, content, and timing. Finally, the study investigates the alignment between institutional goals and the student experience. This project has four goals: 1) To understand the first-year engineering experience and the effects of that experience on students' engineering identity development; 2) To develop recommendations for promoting engineering communities of practice in first-year programs and courses; 3) To further the field's understanding of early engineer formation through triangulated data points; and 4) To develop design strategies for meeting institution-specific first-year engineering development goals. These goals have substantial positive impact on engineering education because they ensure that changes made in first-year engineering are beneficial and help ensure the success of first-year engineering students. Related to intellectual merit, this research parses out how first-year engineering structure, content, and timing help or hinder students' communities of practice and engineering identities to provide concrete evidence for methods that effectively support or oppose students' development and retention in the major."

Large portions of the United States, from Alaska to California and eastward to the New Madrid Seismic Zone and coastal South Carolina and north to the St. Lawrence Seaway, are prone to the impacts from earthquakes.  Earthquakes such as those in New Zealand and others have raised awareness about limitations in our understanding of the cyclic response of natural soil deposits.  These limitations have arisen through continued use of the traditional practice of simplifying geotechnical analyses by considering two main soil types: drained sands and undrained clays.  Design methodologies for nearly all geotechnical systems have developed along these two distinct lines.  However, many natural soil deposits do not fit into these simple categories; transitional silty soils, the subject of this research, are an example.  This study aims to answer pertinent questions concerning the cyclic response of transitional silty soils through systematic and coordinated field and laboratory studies that will improve our understanding of the potential for large deformations and loss of life and property during large earthquakes.  The findings of this research will have broad application across the nation and globe.  Furthermore, this research will have a parallel objective of inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders.  Collaboration with the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon will allow our outreach efforts to reach 150,000 visitors and 40,000 K-12 students and teachers per year, through: (1) public demonstrations of liquefaction and in-situ cyclic tests with a large mobile shaker truck, (2) a compilation of video demonstrations, data, and interviews with the researchers into a permanent interactive exhibit, and (3) development of instructional modules for HMSC staff to help their established outreach effort expand instruction to include coastal hazards such as the Cascadia Subduction Zone and associated tsunami.  The demonstrations will be leveraged to form permanent exhibits and instructional modules, which will greatly extend this outreach effort.<br/><br/>This research will improve our understanding of the in-situ and laboratory cyclic response of silt soils including nonlinearity, degradation of stiffness, triggering of destabilizing excess pore pressures, and the corresponding post-shaking consequences.  Specifically, this study will: (1) narrow the threshold fines content and plasticity separating ""sand-like"" and ""clay-like"" responses to cyclic shear stresses/strains and identify critical threshold states; (2) compare the in-situ, uniaxial and biaxial cyclic response of transitional soils to understand how changes in strong ground motion directionality impacts generation of pore pressure and volumetric strain; (3) determine the effect of soil fabric, stress history, and degree of saturation on the cyclic and post-cyclic response of transitional soils; (4) link the regional findings from this work to previous efforts on transitional soils; and (5) inspire future seismologists, geologists, earthquake engineers, and natural hazard and resilience planners through a long-lived, coordinated outreach program.  This work concentrates on experiments that target small-to-large shear strains, using techniques that range from in-situ cyclic loading from large mobile shakers and blast liquefaction, to specialized and coordinated laboratory tests, allowing the development of an unprecedented dataset critical for improving the understanding of the in-situ and elemental level cyclic response to be bridged."

As an example, there are eight symmetries of a square, consisting of transformations like ""rotate by 90 degrees,"" or ""reflect across a diagonal line,"" and combinations of these.  Each of these symmetries represents a transformation of the plane that leaves the square unchanged, and we say that the transformations of the plane form a representation of the symmetry group of the square. The symmetries of the square and other polygons are special examples of a family of groups called Coxeter groups, which capture and generalize the intuitive notion of a reflection group. In recent decades, mathematicians have discovered a rich theory of representations in which the object being acted on is not a plane (or some higher dimensional analogue), but rather a more structured sort of object, called a category.  This project is concerned with the categorical representation theory of Coxeter groups and some closely related objects, called Hecke algebras, and connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the study of knots and links in topology.<br/><br/>In more detail, three interrelated objects will be studied: (a) categories of Soergel bimodules, (b) Hilbert schemes of points in the plane, and (c) Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.  First, the investogator will continue to develop the theory of categorical diagonalization and apply the results to the categorified representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum groups. This includes work on the categorified Casimir operator.  As an application of categorical diagonalization, the full-twist Rouquier complex acting on categories of Soergel bimodules will be diagonalized, extending work already accomplished in type A.  The resulting eigendecompositions present a method for approaching recent conjectures of Gorsky, Negut, and Rasmussen regarding a deep correspondence between Soergel bimodules and Hilbert schemes. The investigator will utilize categorical diagonalization, as well as recent computational breakthroughs, to work toward a proof of this correspondence.  Finally, the Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen correspondence makes several predictions regarding the structure of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology, which the investigator will explore using insights from the connection with Hilbert schemes."

The broader impact of the project will be to help advance computing beyond the limitations of Moore's Law by making efficient design of high-power-density systems possible. The proposed infrastructure will enable transformative research in design automation, computer architecture, and system design with emerging cooling technologies, particularly in the dimensions of performance, variability, energy, heterogeneity, and cross-layer design.

Over the past several decades, there has been much advancement toward increasing our understanding of how tectonic plates form, move about the surface, and sink back into the Earth's interior; however, we still have fundamental, first-order questions regarding how the mantle convects and drives plate tectonics. Seismology provides the best clues to answer these questions, by using seismic waves caused by earthquakes to generate a 3D image of the interior. One puzzling observation that we find from seismology is the presence of 2 large structures in the lowermost mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific. These structures rest directly on the Earth's core, and extend several hundred kilometers into the mantle. Seismic waves travel slower than usual through these structures, and they seem to have sharp boundaries, indicating that they may be composed of something somewhat different than the surrounding mantle rock. Interestingly, these structures underlie a large number of anomalous active volcanoes (called hotspots), such as Hawaii. By reconstructing plate motions back through time, we find that many extinct, ancient volcanoes were also formed above these same locations. Therefore, if the large structures beneath Africa and the Pacific are the cause of these hotspot volcanoes, they must have been in their present location for a long time, perhaps for the past 500 million years. This is contradictory to computational models of mantle convection that predict that such structures would be easily moved by changing tectonic plate motions. The PI hypothesizes that these deep mantle structures may have a different mineralogical grain size than the rest of the mantle, which could cause them to have a higher viscosity. The team will perform numerical fluid dynamics to examine whether the higher viscosity associated with these structures could lead to a stabilizing of mantle convection currents over geologic time to explain the long-lived creation of volcanoes over these geographic areas. More importantly, the investigators will examine how the dynamics of these African and Pacific structures can guide and control the long term patterns of mantle convection. Results from this study will provide critical insight into understanding how mantle convection causes and controls plate tectonics.<br/><br/>Seismic tomography reveals the presence of large regions in the lowermost mantle (beneath Africa and the Pacific) that exhibit lower-than-average shear wave velocity, commonly referred to as the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs). It has been hypothesized that they are caused by large-scale compositional heterogeneity (e.g., thermochemical piles). Discovering the properties and dynamical implications of the LLSVPs has involved much active research in recent years due to their critical role toward understanding large-scale mantle convection, heat transport, and thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth. Interestingly and somewhat paradoxically, recent paleomagnetic research has hinted that LLSVPs may have remained in the same positions for hundreds of millions of years. This is perplexing because dynamical calculations indicate that they should be easily swept around by changing subduction patterns. This is a critically important issue to address, and here, the following question is explored: Can a reasonable dynamical/rheological conceptual model of thermochemical mantle convection explain how LLSVPs could remain spatially fixed (or very slow moving)? Most geodynamical calculations employ a temperature-dependent rheology, resulting in LLSVPs being weaker (due to their high temperature) and therefore, easier to be laterally pushed around by downwelling slabs. However, diffusion creep rheology is highly sensitive to mineral grain-size (in a power-law manner), so small changes in grain-size can lead to large changes in viscosity. If LLSVPs have remained compositionally distinct from the background mantle over geologic timescales, there is no reason to expect that they would have the same average grain-size as the surrounding mantle. If the average grain-size of LLSVPs is only slightly larger than that of the background mantle, LLSVPs would have an increased compositional viscosity. Preliminary work has shown that when combined with temperature-dependence of viscosity, this leads to a strong rind or envelope surrounding the LLSVPs, producing unusual thermochemical structures that dynamically behave quite differently than conventional, passive thermochemical piles. This type of thermochemical convection has not been explored, and the proposed work will test the hypothesis that grain-size induced compositional dependence of viscosity can lead to LLSVP structures that are less easily pushed around by subducting slabs and therefore, become more spatially-stable over geologic timescales. An extensive geodynamical study (through numerical modeling) will be performed to explore how grain-size dependence of rheology influences the fluid dynamical properties of the system, compared to traditional models. Additionally, grain-size evolution will be employed in a subset of models, to examine whether it is feasible for LLSVPs to have larger grain size than background mantle over the relevant geological timescales. In summary, numerical experiments will be developed and performed to determine how grain-size dependence of viscosity influences the spatial stability of thermochemical piles and whether this is a dynamically feasible mechanism to produce long-lived, stable positions of LLSVPs."

Nitrogen fixation is a process carried out by microorganisms that allows tropical forests to replenish this nutrient. The highest documented nitrogen fixation rates are found in tropical forests, but few measurements have been made in the Amazon Basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest. Phosphorus and molybdenum are two elements that play an important role in the nitrogen fixation process.  Indeed, phosphorus availability is known to limit nitrogen fixation, but no one has determined whether molybdenum has a similar effect in nature.  Because molybdenum is rare, and is easily leached from soils, it's low concentration could lead to low nitrogen fixation rates in the Amazon Basin, where soils are nutrient depleted, and where regions receive little to no new inputs of molybdenum. These so-called ""weathered"" soils in the Amazon Basin are also acidic, and this condition can make it even more difficult for nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to access molybdenum. Research for this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will investigate how these factors interact to constrain nitrogen fixation, which affects how tropical forests will grow in response to environmental change. <br/><br/>The southeastern Amazon is an understudied but important forest ecosystem where (1) nitrogen fixation has not yet been quantified and (2) where molybdenum and phosphorus concentrations are low, likely due to low atmospheric inputs of these elements. Funds from this award will support experiments to test whether nitrogen fixation by free-living soil microorganisms in the southeastern Amazon is directly constrained by low phosphorus or molybdenum, or indirectly limited via pH effects on phosphorus and molybdenum complexation in soils. The researchers will conduct phosphorus, molybdenum, and lime plot addition experiments, and will measure long-term changes in nitrogen fixation rates and in the availability of phosphorus and molybdenum. Results will be disseminated in review papers for extrapolation of global nitrogen fixation rates for earth system models. In addition, the researchers will train and collaborate with Brazilian students and use the results to develop a teaching module for the annual Expanding Your Horizons workshop for middle school girls interested in science."

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. In alignment with these aims, the STEM + Digital Literacies (STEM+L) project will investigate science fiction as an effective mechanism to attract and immerse adolescents (ages 10-13) from diverse cultural backgrounds in environmental and human health content and socio-scientific issues. This work is particularly novel, as the current knowledge base is limited, and largely addresses the high school level. Therefore, the results of the proposed effort could yield important findings regarding the feasibility of this activity as an effective platform for science learning and engagement for younger students. As such, STEM+L would not only advance knowledge in the field but would also contribute to a growing AISL portfolio on digital literacy and learning. <br/><br/>STEM+L is an early stage Innovations in Development project that will engage thirty middle school students in out of school time experiences. Over a twenty-four-week period, students will work collaboratively in groups in-person and online with their peers and field experts to design, develop, and produce STEM content rich, multimedia science fictions. The in-person learning experiences will take place on the University of Miami campus during the summer and academic year. Culminating activities include student presentations online and at a local Science Fiction Festival. The research component will employ an iterative, design-based approach. Four research questions will be explored: (a) How do students learn science concepts and multimodal digital literacies through participating in the STEM+L Academy? (b) How do students change their views in STEM related subject matter and in pursuing STEM related careers? (c) How do students participate in the STEM+L Academy? (d) How do we best support students' participation and learning of STEM+L in face-to-face and online environments? Data collection methods include video records, student-generated artifacts, online surveys, embedded assessments, interviews, and multimodal reflections. Comparative case analysis and a mixed methods approach will be employed.  A rigorous evaluation will be conducted by a critical external review board. Inclusive and innovative dissemination strategies will ensure that the results of the research and program reach a broad range of audiences including both informal and formal STEM and literacy educators and researchers, learning scientists, local communities, and policy makers through national and international conference presentations, journal publications, Web2.0 resources, and community outreach activities."

Over the course of 12 months, Kojanic will conduct semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and archival research. This case study will contribute to the debate on property relations in social sciences by testing the analytic value of the underused concept of ownership, as differentiated from the concept of property."

For example, topology can be used to measure how biological processes change the shape of our DNA.   Surprisingly, these shape changes can be analyzed through three- and four-dimensional manifolds, fundamental shapes in topology that appear throughout mathematics and physics.  This leads to the fundamental problem of trying to completely understand and classify these three- and four-dimensional manifolds.  While we understand many aspects of three-dimensional objects, in dimension four we are still mostly in the dark.  One effective tool for studying these objects is called Floer homology, which comes from solving powerful equations from physics.  In this project, the PI will use Floer homology to study the complexity of these shapes by analyzing the configurations of knotted loops and surfaces inside of them.  The potential outcome of this project will be to strengthen connections between knots and three-/four-dimensional manifolds while discovering new structure in the topology of four-dimensional manifolds.  This project will then be disseminated to the public through a collaboration with Black Box Dance Theater, a North Carolina non-profit dance company.  By way of dance performances and public workshops, this will present to the public the fundamental notions of topology used in the proposed project.  This joint project will also work to improve public perception of mathematics and enhance connections between STEM and the arts.<br/><br/>Knots can be used to produce new three- and four-manifolds by an operation called Dehn surgery, where one removes a tubular neighborhood and reglues via a homeomorphism.  Many invariants and tools in low-dimensional topology, especially Floer homology, are particularly well-behaved under Dehn surgery, and the PI will use these tools to improve our understanding of three- and four-manifolds and further their connections with knot theory.  Three major goals of this project are to: 1) construct homology three-spheres which cannot be obtained by Dehn surgery on a two-component link, 2) find new constraints on the algebraic topology of four-manifolds admitting symplectic structures, and 3) further explore the algebraic structure of the concordance group of knots in homology spheres modulo concordance in homology cobordisms.  Two potential outcomes would be a better understanding of the complexity of four-manifolds with boundary measured in terms of their handlebody structures and a stronger connection between properties of a knot and the topology of its Dehn surgeries."

Current research strategies typically require accurate positioning of quantum emitters at nanocavity-localized hotspots, to benefit from increased photonic density of states. In this project, the research team employs both experimental and computational approaches to advance fundamental knowledge of the directional, superradiant coherent light emission from a collection of quantum emitters embedded in unique epsilon-near-zero plasmonic nanochannels. The in-phase plasmonic field confined in an epsilon-near-zero nanochannel provides a path to overcome the localized hotspot dependence and allows emitters to radiate coherently and collaboratively over long distances. The team elucidates fundamental properties of coherent light emission by addressing Dicke superradiance, the Purcell effect and Frster resonance energy transfer in a plasmonic epsilon-near-zero material. In so doing, the team fills gaps in foundational physics understanding, allowing the creation of new nanostructures with unique properties and functionalities. This new knowledge is expected to lead to novel on-chip optical components and coherent light sources for nanophotonic applications, quantum information processing and sensing."

In joint work with his collaborators, he has recently developed a new geometric technique of ""abelianization"" -- so called because it reduces nonabelian problems (involving operations for which the order in which we do the operations matters) to simpler abelian ones (where the order does not matter). The PI, together with his collaborators and graduate students, will work on several new applications of abelianization. One application is a new approach to solving certain differential equations, including the Schrodinger equation which governs the physics of some quantum systems. A second application is a new way of measuring the topology of 3-dimensional spaces. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly both in the mathematics and high-energy physics communities, helping to bring these two areas closer together. The work will also contribute to the training of graduate students in both fields.<br/><br/>The PI's recent joint work with collaborators introduced a new ingredient to the theory of flat connections: a way of ""abelianizing"" flat connections on a rank N complex vector bundle over a surface, replacing them by almost-flat connections on a line bundle over an N-fold branched covering surface. The full scope of this new theory is not yet known: it appears that there are many more uses of abelianization yet to be discovered. The PI aims to develop some of these.  First, he will study a family of special connections on surfaces called ""opers,"" which can be abelianized in a canonical way.  On the one hand, this is a warmup for the abelianization of the twistor lines in the Hitchin system. On the other hand, it gives a new way of understanding the locus of opers and thus a new perspective on many related issues, from the classical theory of linear scalar differential operators to nonperturbative extensions of topological string theory. Second, he will consider abelianization on a 3-manifold instead of a surface. One immediate application is the development of new formulas for classical complex Chern-Simons invariants. Third, the PI aims to develop a new relation between abelianization and Floer theory on cotangent bundles."

These data will allow the researcher to explore how individuals with Down Syndrome experience healthcare and how they deploy social networks as they consider their health, their life goals, and their social and caregiving relationships. Key research foci include the individual desires and lived experience of those with Down Syndrome, and how healthcare encounters affect and are affected by their life plans and personal values. The research will bring an understudied aspect of the human experience -- the lived experiences of individuals with intellectual disability -- into emerging social scientific theory on intellectual disability and health inequality. Findings also can be used to improve clinical care and build equitable health policy.

The simplest manifestation of representation theory is in dimensional analysis, as in ""the way to combine a distance L and a time T into a quantity with dimension velocity is to take L/T;"" in this example, rescaling the units of measure becomes a symmetry. In general, analyzing symmetries of physical systems leads to a very fine-grained analysis of how different components of a system may interact. Classical representation theory gives simple and beautiful results by focusing on the question of decomposing systems into components that do not interact between themselves (semisimplicity). Another way to decompose systems is to create a hierarchy of components, with ""larger"" components affecting ""smaller"" components, but no interaction in the other direction (as in a particle with negligible mass orbiting a planet). Nowadays many examples are known of types of symmetry for which we can obtain a complete description of possible hierarchies forced by these symmetries. This project will develop new ways to understand these hierarchies and the resulting interactions.<br/><br/>In more detail, the main goal of this project is to study large categories appearing in representation theory of Lie superalgebras, algebraic supergroups, and infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, focusing on applications to the theory of abstract tensor categories. Key objectives include the construction of particular large limits of categories of representations, describing them as universal (in a certain sense) tensor categories, and extracting from universality a detailed description of these categories of representations. Via these connections with large tensor categories, categorification, and duality, this work aims to contribute to the solution of longstanding classical questions about representations of supergroups, such as the computation of characters, dimension formulae, and Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. A second goal of the project is geometric: to generalize the theory of spherical varieties to the super case. The theory of spherical varieties is a beautiful mix of algebraic geometry and representation theory. The question of developing an analogous theory for supergroups is complicated because of the lack of semisimplicity. Finally, questions of harmonic analysis, such as decomposing the space of functions and describing the spectra of invariant differential operators, are essential in modern theoretical physics. A third goal of the project is to develop an approach to these questions via theory of supersymmetric polynomials and supergeometry."

Studying the full range of these early behaviors is critical to both understanding how modern humans adapted to diverse environments and refining models of human evolution and migration. The proposed research is based on materials excavated from a MSA archaeological site located in a previously unstudied region of the lowlands of northwestern Ethiopia along the Shinfa River, a major tributary to the Blue Nile River. The site is dated to greater than 50,000 years in age, close to the time when modern humans dispersed out of Africa. The research will study the fauna excavated at the site that includes a diverse array of terrestrial and aquatic animals that the humans hunted, trapped, collected, and brought back to the site to eat. Investigation of these animal remains will detail which species were collected, when they were collected, and how they were processed. The site is unusual for the MSA because in addition to terrestrial animals a large quantity of aquatic animals (e.g., fish, crocodile, and mollusk) are also present, and this combination of species permits an evaluation of the evidence for early riverine adaptations and structured seasonal resource use. Both of these activities have important implications for the evolution of modern human behavioral and social systems, and both have been argued to be largely absent during the MSA. Data from this study will also contribute to the broader debate about the significance of aquatic resource use during hominin evolution. Additionally, this project is the first to examine how regional seasonal extremes selected for flexible adaptive strategies in the MSA specifically within the context of temporary river ecosystems and how this particular ecological setting might have influenced early human behavior. The broader project involves a collaboration between US and Ethiopian scholars, students, officials, and local communities, and its NSF-supported research experience for undergraduates trains US and Ethiopian students and includes a focus on participants from groups underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Under the supervision of Dr. John Kappelman, Ph.D. candidate Christopher Davis will reconstruct foraging behavior at the archaeological site with a focus on answering two research questions: 1) Does the site document an early riverine adaptation? and 2) Does the site document structured seasonal occupation and resource exploitation? The methods are drawn from a large body of ethnoarchaeological and experimental research that uses faunal remains to reconstruct past human behavior. Faunal analyses will document the taxonomic groups and skeletal elements present at the site. Taphonomic analyses will identify the agent(s) of site formation, how the faunal elements were processed, and which natural processes potentially altered the assemblage. Behavioral analyses will reconstruct foraging strategies, and examine evidence for systematic riverine foraging and seasonal occupation. Comparative analyses will evaluate how foraging behaviors at this site compares with those from other similarly aged sites in Ethiopia."

Classically, algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of systems of polynomial equations, and it plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and applied. The solution space of a system of polynomial equations has a very rich structure that can be smooth (continuous) or singular (discontinuous). This project is concerned with a new approach to singularities that arises from transferring ideas from complex geometry to an algebraic setting. The main goal is to further develop the theory of ""Hodge ideals,"" which are subtle invariants of singularities.  <br/><br/>In more detail, several directions of research will be pursued: extending the current version of Hodge ideals associated to reduced hypersurfaces (one would like extensions to Q-divisors or to ideals defining a subscheme that is reduced in codimension one); extending the study of Hodge filtrations on localizations at one element (which is equivalent to the study of Hodge ideals) to the study of Hodge filtrations on local cohomology modules of a regular local ring along an arbitrary ideal; investigating a potential analogue of Hodge ideals in positive characteristic; exploiting the connection between Hodge ideals and the motivic Chern transformation of Brasselet-Schuermann-Yokura; and developing tools based on more classical methods to give new proofs of results on Hodge ideals whose current proofs rely on Saito's theory of Hodge modules."

This project will investigate and advance the knowledge of shear buckling response, thus leading to improved economy, durability, and safety of structures that use thin plates.  The focus of this study is on steel plates, but it lays the foundation for other materials such as aluminum and composites that can be considered in future work.  This project also addresses the grand challenges recently issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE): (a) significantly enhance the performance and value of infrastructure projects over their life cycles by 2025, and (b) foster the optimization of infrastructure investments for society.  The results will  increase cost efficiency  via decreased material usage; enhance robustness via increased ultimate shear strength; and reduce occurrence of buckling and increased resilience to unexpected loads (e.g. with fewer required repairs) via increased buckling load capacity. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to comprehensively investigate the mechanics of shear buckling behavior in steel plates, thus leading to (a) new predictive models that capture the true mechanics, and (b) design modifications that increase economy, robustness, and life-cycle performance.

A detailed examination of the stress patterns and load redistribution from the elastic buckling stage to the ultimate postbuckling capacity will be the primary focus.  Physical tests will explore new panel configurations, and potential material optimizations will be identified based on finite element mechanics studies.

As a result, numerous first-year programs, courses, and experiences exist, with new ones created each year. While first-year engineering education is heavily dependent on the history, design, and political structure of the host institution, it remains important to use research results to inform the creation and alteration of the first-year engineering courses, programs, and experiences. Recent research investigations have generated knowledge of the differences in course structure and content if first-year engineering courses. However, faculty and administrators designing first-year engineering education commonly ask questions that are not addressed by current literature, such as ""Is it better for students to have a common first-year experience or one that is discipline specific?"" or ""Should transfer students have a different course than freshmen?""  While it is likely that neither is better or worse, there are differences that must be investigated so faculty and administrators can make informed decisions regarding changes to first-year engineering education to enhance the student experience for all. This study intends to clarify how first-year engineering structure (e.g., common engineering, discipline specific), content (e.g., design, problem solving, academic success), and timing (e.g., one or two semesters) help or hinder students pursuing a variety of engineering pathways.<br/><br/>Through a three-phase exploratory qualitative case study employing individual interviews and focus groups, this study attempts to answer the research question: how do students who are pursuing engineering degrees through pathways that vary with respect to first-year engineering structure, content, and timing describe their experience participating in engineering communities of practice and their emerging engineering identities? Through the community of practice framework, this research determines what communities of practice are formed during first-year engineering and their relation to engineering identity in diverse first-year engineering experiences. The researchers are evaluating the differences in student development through the various experiences, focusing on the impacts of structure, content, and timing. Finally, the study investigates the alignment between institutional goals and the student experience. This project has four goals: 1) To understand the first-year engineering experience and the effects of that experience on students' engineering identity development; 2) To develop recommendations for promoting engineering communities of practice in first-year programs and courses; 3) To further the field's understanding of early engineer formation through triangulated data points; and 4) To develop design strategies for meeting institution-specific first-year engineering development goals. These goals have substantial positive impact on engineering education because they ensure that changes made in first-year engineering are beneficial and help ensure the success of first-year engineering students. Related to intellectual merit, this research parses out how first-year engineering structure, content, and timing help or hinder students' communities of practice and engineering identities to provide concrete evidence for methods that effectively support or oppose students' development and retention in the major."

This specialized cell type, the guard cell, occurs in the epidermis, where pairs of guard cells enclose microscopic pores called stomata, through which plants take up CO2 (the substrate for photosynthesis) and, inevitably, lose water. Resultant improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which guard cells respond to drought and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can assist in development of crop varieties with greater yield under a range of growing conditions. General insights into biological networks gained in this project will improve understanding of dysregulated cell signaling, with broad implications for physiology, agriculture, and biotechnology. Personnel, including undergraduate researchers, will be cross-trained in emerging approaches in both experimental and computational biology. The principal investigators will develop a new course to introduce first year undergraduates to biological networks and other mathematical biology concepts and encourage STEM participation. <br/><br/>Heterotrimeric G-proteins, composed of G-alpha subunits and G-beta-gamma dimers, comprise a ubiquitous signaling mechanism found in organisms as diverse as fungi, animals, and plants. This research will study G protein involvement in guard cell drought and CO2 signaling networks to address the fundamental question of whether and how G-alpha subunits compete for or partition their interaction with specific G-beta-gamma dimers. In plants, guard cells are the best understood single cell system of G protein regulation. In response to the hormone abscisic acid (ABA; an indicator of drought and other stresses), and to elevated concentrations of CO2, complex signaling networks are activated in guard cells that drive stomatal closure. This project will use genetic analyses to determine competition vs. partitioning of the four G-alpa subunits for the three Arabidopsis G-beta-gamma dimers during ABA and CO2 responses. The research will apply tests of protein-protein interaction to assess new candidate G protein interactors and to determine how G protein signaling interconnects with other known ABA and CO2 signaling components of guard cells. The project will develop new general reachability analysis and combinatorial logic methods to describe convergent or overlapping networks, and these methods will then be applied to the new experimental datasets obtained to create a new network model of the core components of G protein, ABA, and CO2 signaling. The new combinatorial logic methods for network construction developed will advance fundamental knowledge in systems biology: they will be applicable to directional signaling and genetic networks of any organism, and will enable a paradigm shift from assuming isolated linear pathways (e.g. as in classic epistasis analysis) to considering all network architectures consistent with a set of observations. Thus, the results from this research will have general implications for the common but complex phenomenon of cross-talk in biological systems."

This project investigates the intersection of these strategies and how they facilitate the persistence of blue crabs and a pathogenic virus along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The widespread distribution of this crab-virus system makes it useful for investigating host-pathogen interactions. Blue crabs can reduce their activity level and induce winter dormancy in colder climates, but it is unclear how this alters progression and transmission of the pathogen. Conversely, year-round growth and reproduction of tropical blue crabs may be offset by higher pathogen abundance and activity. This project will use a combination of field and laboratory studies to reveal how crab life history and pathogen dynamics interact and adapt at the extremes of their range. Genetic sequencing, crab movement tracking and oceanographic models will be used to understand how crab-disease dynamics vary across temperate and tropical latitudes. The blue crab is an ecologically and economically important species and knowledge generated in this project will help provide management guidance to support sustainable fisheries. Best practices to avoid and limit disease will be communicated to commercial and artisanal harvesters through partnerships and workshops. Local high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be engaged through a variety of formal and informal educational programs. Public outreach will be implemented through a museum partnership with the Shedd Aquarium and will include the training of a science communication intern.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine empirical field and laboratory experiments, population genomics, and biophysical modeling to explore the consequences of latitude-driven changes in life history and oceanic connectivity on a trans-hemispheric pathosystem comprised of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the pathogenic virus, CsRV1. The virulence of the CsRV1 virus from tropical and temperate latitudes and the impact of overwintering will be studied by experimental virus challenges of crabs transplanted between high and low latitudes. The impact of infection and virulence on crab movement will be investigated in laboratory raceway experiments of healthy and infected crabs and in the field with acoustically tagged crabs deployed in temperate and tropical locations. Population genetic studies using thousands of genome-wide RAD sequencing markers for crabs and whole-genome sequencing for the virus will define genetic connectivity of crab and virus populations across their range, and will investigate the possible latitudinal, seascape, and life history-driven changes in blue crab and virus genomes. The two population genomic data sets are expected to provide different inferences and scales of connectivity because CsRV1 virus genotypes are transmitted only among post-larval crabs while blue crab genotypes also move by a potentially long-range dispersive larval stage. Finally, integrated biophysical models will be used to investigate the relative contributions of adult and larval dispersal on the population structure of the crab and the pathogen across a broad swath of habitat between New England and Argentina with a decade of simulations. An open-source Lagrangian stochastic model will estimate pelagic larval transport, and spatially explicit biased-correlated random walk models will estimate adult movement. Models will be informed by experimentally-derived movement and behavior data, as well as information on crab larval and adult behavior and overwintering duration available in the published literature. Under a series of scenarios in which crab behavior is affected by latitude and virus infection, statistical comparisons will be made between biophysical model-based predictions of connectivity and genetic estimates of connectivity. These analyses will advance our understanding of the physical, environmental, and biological factors that shape the dynamics of the blue crab CsRV1 pathosystem."

The research is focused on the rise and spread of the therapeutic community movement. Therapeutic communities are mutual-aid communities where substance users and the homeless are sent to rehabilitate each other. No longer common in the United States, where bio-medical and pharmaceutical approaches are more common, therapeutic communities continue to spread in other parts of the world. The researcher asks why this is the case and what the effects are for caregivers, care receivers, and other stakeholders.  <br/><br/>The research will be carried out in Puerto Rico by Columbia University anthropology doctoral researcher, Caroline Parker, supervised by Dr. Jennifer Hirsch. In Puerto Rico, which is both home to many therapeutic communities and a key source of their spread to other countries, this form of care comprises a crucial safety net for some of the island's most vulnerable populations. Puerto Rican therapeutic communities are usually peer-operated: program graduates perform essential caregiving duties as therapists, treatment leaders, and directors. The researcher will undertake archival research and oral history interviews to  trace the historical growth of Puerto Rico's therapeutic communities from a single state-run program founded in the early 1960s to a decentralized network of over 150 mutual-aid collectives operating across the island. In addition to the historical component, she will conduct twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork in two of the communities, collecting data through long-term participant observation and in-depth interviews. Finally, she will combine legal-policy research and key informant interviews to examine the specific institutions, state practices and laws that produce and sustain these forms of care."

This formalism has yielded excellent electronic structure predictions for many different classes of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. However, these predictions come at significant computational cost; extracting band structures from density functional theory (DFT), based on the single-electron energies and orbitals obtained from the solution of the Kohn-Sham equation, could alleviate this cost. <br/><br/>The project involves a binational theoretical and computational collaboration to develop a new class of density functionals - optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OTRSH) functionals - capable of predicting accurate quasiparticle band gaps and band structures, and optical spectra, including electron-hole interactions, for a range of complex solid-state materials, with greater computational efficiency than existing approaches. Using a benchmark set of well-studied materials, the team will: i) determine range-separation parameters that lead to the best match between OTRSH and the leading-edge excited-state method for each of these compounds; ii) develop the physics of the range-separation parameters; and iii) advance the OTRSH approach. The research team will then apply the OTRSH approach to a range of complex systems of contemporary interest, including transition metal oxides, Dirac materials, halide perovskites, and two-dimensional materials. The research activity will also address several open questions systematically, and ultimately develop an efficient DFT approach for understanding existing and predicting new excited-state phenomena in complex materials.<br/><br/>Central to the proposed effort is outreach to and mentoring of next-generation computational materials theorists at all age levels, augmented by targeted recruitment of women and other underrepresented-minority undergraduate and graduate students.

Today, most computer hardware executes programs in a non-deterministic fashion: a program may yield different output or behavior in different runs, given the exact same input, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Recent research enforces deterministic execution in inherently non-deterministic systems. Unfortunately, this often comes at a steep performance price. Also, until now determinism is only available for non-interactive programs. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of deterministic execution of concurrent programs, and to include a large class of interactive programs in the scope of deterministic execution. Longer term, the goal is to make deterministic computing a viable choice, where nondeterminism is the only option today. This would likely improve both the safety and quality of the vast number of multithreaded programs running on today's and tomorrow's multicore devices.<br/><br/>To bring the benefits of deterministic execution to real-world programs, this project investigates algorithms, runtime systems, operating systems and hardware support to improve the performance and applicability of determinism. The project is organized along three major thrusts: combating the clock skew in deterministic logical clocks that imposes unnecessary waiting on threads, using speculation to break the serial bottleneck that current systems impose on synchronization operations, and extending the scope of determinism to encompass interactive applications. The researchers plan to openly distribute the systems built for this project to facilitate examination by other researchers and integration with computer systems education."

Fundamentally, the difficulty arises because variations in the material structure are on the same scale as the optical wavelength. Brute-force approaches thus require very fine discretization of the materials and a very large number of parameters, which is frequently computationally infeasible. The investigator and collaborators aim to develop new mathematical techniques that allow extraction of important properties and features of a system without the need for full simulation. In medical imaging, an initial image could thus be reconstructed in real time. Such an initial image can be useful in itself, or used as input to speed up the run time of high-resolution methods. In design of materials, the energy losses of a material can be estimated to provide qualitative insight into the potential suitability of the material and thus accelerate the construction of the next generation of optical devices. Several graduate and undergraduate students will participate in related research projects.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to solve several open problems related to optics and photonics of heterogeneous materials. The project will involve four main components. The first is to find a complete characterization of boundary effects in periodic optical materials. While boundary corrections in homogenization theory are notoriously difficult to understand, they have a large effect on the resulting fields. A large class of periodic optical materials can be studied by new asymptotic techniques that will allow us to fully characterize the role of the boundary.  The second is the derivation of explicit formulae for various spectral properties of periodic scatterers. This includes the transmission eigenvalues, which can be read in the far field and provide information about the medium. The third is to develop a new reduced order model approach to inversion of elliptic operators. The method employs ideas from model reduction theory, and originates from a breakthrough in a previous spectrally matched grid approach that allows application to higher dimensions and general geometries.  The last goal is to derive explicit calculations of the resonance values for multiple linear and nonlinear scatterer interactions. The investigator and collaborators use spectral asymptotic perturbation methods to understand the behavior of multiple-scatterer resonant interactions, both for linear materials and for Kerr effects."

The primary purpose of this research is to develop mathematical methods to improve understanding of important phenomena, particularly turbulence in fluids and the aging of glasses, which are well-known but poorly-understood systems in physics and materials science.

The mathematical tools to analyze these systems are drawn from integrable systems, kinetic theory, partial differential equations and probability theory. Four projects are considered: (a) random isometric embeddings and turbulence in incompressible fluids; (b) conformal processes with branching; (c) aging of spin glasses; and (d) statistical behavior of algorithms in numerical linear algebra. Projects (a) and (b) provide rigorous results on random geometry. In project (a), turbulence heuristics are used to improve the known critical exponents for the isometric embedding problem in differential geometry. This construction also sheds light on random fluid flows arising in isotropic homogeneous turbulence. In project (b), a new stochastic partial differential equation, whose solutions describe conformally embedded trees, is investigated. Project (c) considers a basic model for vitreous systems in materials science. The purpose of project (d) is to quantify the `probability of difficulty' for several widely used algorithms in computer science. Both these projects are unified by the study of glassy behavior. In particular, the algorithms studied may be viewed as high-dimensional dynamical systems with exponentially many critical points. Their performance reflects glassy behavior such as aging and metastability. Conversely, the algorithms serve as numerical laboratories that shed light on aging dynamics in physical glasses."

In particular, the symmetries of a given problem are often described by families of matrices, which are called Lie groups. More recently, the needs of quantum physics and statistical mechanics have led to the development of deformations of Lie groups, which are called quantum groups. In the last two decades of the Twentieth Century great breakthroughs in topology were obtained through the introduction of techniques from  non-euclidean  (hyperbolic) geometry, which is based on the Lie group of 2-by-2 matrices with determinant 1. At about the same time, the development of quantum groups provided new tools to analyze the knotting of curves in 3-dimensional space, with the quantum group arising from deformations of 2-by-2 matrices playing a particularly important role. The projects investigates various problems where these groups interact with the geometry of spaces of dimension 2 and 3. In particular, it takes advantage of the insights developed for 2-by-2 matrices to address higher dimensional groups, involving n-by-n matrices. <br/> <br/>Many classical problems in mathematics and in mathematical physics can be expressed in terms of homomorphisms from fundamental groups of surfaces to Lie groups, such as groups of matrices. For instance, the great breakthroughs of hyperbolic geometry that occurred in the decades surrounding the year 2000 have involved the analysis of such homomorphisms valued  in the special linear group SL_2. Similarly, the quantum invariants of knots and low-dimensional manifolds that were developed at about the same time are based on the deformations of Lie groups called quantum groups. In particular, the Jones polynomial invariant of knots can be expressed in terms of the quantum group U_q(sl_2) deforming the Lie group SL_2. The thrust of the research is to build on the insights developed for these low-dimensional Lie groups in order to address higher rank Lie groups and quantum groups. The project is focused on the character varieties that consist of homomorphisms from surface groups to Lie groups. Its two main themes build on the interaction between two different areas of mathematics.  The first topic deals with the geometric and dynamic properties of the so-called Hitchin homomorphisms, valued in a split real algebraic group such as the special linear group, and on the moduli spaces of such homomorphisms. The PI and his students will study the Poisson geometry of the space of Hitchin homomorphisms, will investigate Hitchin homomorphisms from the point of view of spectral networks, and will study the group actions on affine buildings that arise as degenerations of such homomorphisms.  The second theme studies the skein algebras that occur in the theory of quantum invariants of knots based on the quantum group U_q(sl_n), and their algebraic properties when the quantum parameter is a root of unity.  The PI will investigate the extension to this general case of the ""miraculous cancellations"" that he discovered in earlier work  for U_q(sl_2). The project includes a series of separate problems that can accommodate the doctoral work of graduate students, while enhancing the postdoctoral experience of the junior faculty in the research group of the PI. The visual aspects of the project lend themselves to the involvement of undergraduate students, as well as to outreach aimed at making mathematics exciting for K-12 and undergraduate students."

In particular, their resistance to radiation damage is insufficient. We investigate here one approach to increase materials radiation resistance, where small additions of carefully selected alloying elements are used to drastically slow down the kinetics of evolution of these materials. The approach takes advantage of the large body of accurate data now available to the community from high-throughput atomistic calculations to screen the most promising alloying elements. The research proposes to employ state-of-the-art nanoscale experiments to validate this approach in a copper matrix, for which antimony has been pre-selected as a promising alloying element. The work also aims at determining whether this material design approach can be combined with another one, relying on the spontaneous formation of precipitates at the nanoscale, thus resulting in extreme radiation resistance. The research will provide education for two graduate students and several undergraduate students, with an emphasis on advanced materials synthesis and characterization techniques, and atomistic modeling. Special effort will be made to recruit female and underrepresented minority students. The research will be integrated with education to further develop and implement active learning techniques.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>This fundamental research program examines a strategy for designing single phase materials resistant to radiation damage by using small alloying additions of solutes that trap point defects so as to increase point defect mutual recombination over their elimination at sinks. While this strategy has been considered in the past, and yielded encouraging results, it has not received widespread attention in large part because no reliable method was available to select the best solutes to trap point defect. The proposed research takes advantage of recent modeling advances to overcome these limitations. Specifically, for a Cu matrix, using first principles calculations to calculate solute-point defect interactions, and self-consistent mean-field theory to calculate defect and solute transport coefficients, Sb was identified as one of these promising solutes. The experimental program measures directly the relative rate of recombination over sink elimination during irradiation of dilute Cu-Sb alloys from the broadening and the drift of thin marker layers placed at strategic positions in a Cu thin film bounded by Nb layers, the Cu/Nb interfaces providing near perfect sinks for point defect elimination. These broadenings and shifts are measured at the nanoscale using atom probe tomography (APT) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition this approach is implemented for imparting radiation resistance to alloys that self-organizes under irradiation, such as Cu-Fe, so as to further extend their stability under irradiation. By combining the two approaches, point defect trapping and compositional patterning, radiation resistance can be achieved in a vastly extended domain of irradiation conditions. The experimental program is complemented by atomistic KMC simulations to support the data analysis and to explore the potential impact of simplifications made during the solute screening stage. The impact of the program is broadened by offering research opportunities to undergraduates and by integrating research with education through computational modules in courses taught by the PIs. Active engagement is also offered to develop, assess, and spread active learning techniques."

This processing approach can be applied to Nickel-based superalloys, which are specialized materials that have excellent high-temperature strength and good oxidation resistance, and hence are used in a wide range of technologies and applications. This award supports research to understand the fundamental relationships between processing and performance which will allow development of optimal additive manufacturing processes to fabricate nickel-based superalloy parts.  An optimal process will enable the additively manufactured nickel-based superalloys to have excellent resistance to surface damage by high temperature oxidation while also retaining superior strength. Additively manufactured alloys have potential application in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, energy, and chemical industries. The results from this research therefore have the potential to benefit the U.S. economy and enhance manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, the research results will be incorporated into curriculum enhancement, student training, industrial collaboration, and an educational outreach program. Activities supported under this award will contribute to recruiting students from underrepresented groups to participate in research, and will positively impact higher education in science and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>The combination of high strength and superior oxidation resistance of nickel-based superalloys make these materials good candidates for high-temperature applications. Additively manufactured nickel-based superalloys can possess mechanical properties comparable to those produced by conventional manufacturing techniques, but their resistance to high temperature oxidation is not comparable to conventionally manufactured components. To enable the application of additive manufacturing for high-temperature alloy fabrication, this research aims to understand and predict the processing-microstructure-oxidation relationships for additive manufactured nickel-based superalloys. The research team will fabricate nickel-based superalloys in layered forms using the laser engineered net shaping additive manufacturing technique,  perform microstructural analysis on the alloys using electron microscopy,  predict the solidification microstructure of the additive manufactured Ni alloys using numerical modeling techniques, and  measure the high-temperature oxidation performance of additive manufactured Ni alloys via thermogravimetric analysis.  This research will provide knowledge for determination of a critical cooling rate below which the superior high-temperature corrosion properties can be maintained in the additive manufactured nickel-based superalloys."

This modification may enable the host to respond quickly to parasitism and reduce its negative effects. The parasite lives in the nests of this and other species of birds in the Galapagos and feeds on nestlings, and is a threat to their survival. Studying how this modification acts as a rapid defense against parasites will provide insights into how animals adapt to new environmental threats. This project will involve training undergraduates in field biology techniques and scientific writing. It will also incorporate workshops for Galapagos National Park rangers and tour guides to help develop strategies for monitoring and controlling this pest species in the Galapagos.<br/><br/>This project will analyze DNA methylation patterns of mockingbirds studied during four field seasons: two in which mockingbirds were tolerant to the fly parasite, P. downsi, and two in which the fly caused high mortality. During the field study, mockingbird nests were either fumigated with permethrin, a dilute insecticide, that killed the parasite, or sham-fumigated as a control, that let the nests be naturally infested. Growth, health and fledging success of parasitized and non-parasitized nestlings were compared and nestlings were sampled for blood twice during the nestling period. These blood samples, along with samples collected from study birds later recaptured as adults, will be analyzed for variation in methylation patterns. DNA methylation analysis will allow the researchers to identify genes that are affected by parasitism in tolerant vs. non-tolerant years as well as to investigate whether methylation alterations persist to adulthood and are potentially even heritable. The results of this research will provide new insights into epigenetic mechanisms of rapid adaptation in wild populations."

Stimulated by the advancements in fields such as genomics and medical imaging, the last decade has witnessed exciting and remarkable progress in personalized medicine, ranging from treatments for breast cancer to treatments for major depressive disorders.  The success of precision medicine depends on the development of accurate and reliable statistical and machine learning tools for estimating the optimal treatment regime given the data collected from randomized experiments or observational studies.

A systematic framework for estimating optimal treatment regimes using a new quantile criterion for a variety of scenarios will be developed.    The research will focus on both one-stage (static) treatment regimes and dynamic treatment regimes, the latter allowing for treatments to vary with time.  In addition, the research will address completely observed responses and randomly censored responses (e.g., survival times), randomized trials and observational studies, and doubly robust estimation. The framework will also be extended to alternative criteria such as Gini's mean difference. This project will significantly advance the theoretical foundations of a large class of robust estimators of optimal treatment regimes.  Furthermore, it addresses the challenging and important problem of developing new methodology and algorithms to identity important variables for optimal treatment regime estimation in the high-dimensional setting.

The resolution of fundamental conjectures in geometry and topology is an outgrowth of this work. An additional component of the research program is an investigation of spaces that have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years. Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, to reveal hidden symmetries, and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.

Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces. A bilipschitz embedding in a certain Banach space is a topic of interest to theoretical computer scientists; in previous work, the PI and collaborators improved the best-known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture."

Besides increasing advocacy and administrative service on such issues, this goal is pursued by means of weekly community building and career development meetings, an annual mentoring retreat, and the development of equity training modules for faculty.<br/><br/>The symplectic category and pseudoholomorphic quilt invariants introduced by the PI provide a general framework for studying questions relating the symplectic category to others, e.g. categories of sheaves involved in mirror symmetry (thus encoding relations between symplectic and algebraic geometry), or cobordism categories involved in topological field theories (thus in particular constructing invariants of 3- and 4-manifolds). One core goal of the research is to extend the categorical structures to general symplectic manifolds with the help of analysis for singular quilts and more refined algebraic structures - both motivated by capturing obstructions arising from novel figure eight bubbles. This extension can be summarized in a notion of A-infinity-2-category which in particular contains all FukayaA-infinity-categories of symplectic manifolds. The proposal's aim is a fully rigorous and accessible construction of this category. Another goal is to establish an abstract construction principle for topological invariants via the symplectic category and algebraic tools for relating them to each other as well as gauge theoretic invariants. This provides a unified understanding for both Ozsvath-Szabo's Heegard-Floer theory and its relation to Seiberg-Witten invariants, as well as conjectural symplectic versions of Donaldson invariants and instanton Floer homology. In addition, it can help systematize future constructions and proofs of relationships between such invariants. The proposal also aims to apply this conceptual framework in some concrete situations. In particular, it addresses Atiyah-Floer type conjectures in dimension 3 - solidifying a guiding vision for the field - and extends them to dimension 4 - providing a vision for future developments. More concretely, this last part aims at establishing symplectic analogues of both Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten 4-manifold invariants, which are expected to be more amenable to calculations. Finally, the project aims to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs. After finalizing the blueprint for rigorous Kuranishi-type regularizations, the focus will lie on increasing access to the polyfold technology. In particular, a group of junior researchers is being involved in efforts to build a toolbox (such as fiber products and equivariant transversality) and sample applications from equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants via the Arnold conjecture to Fukaya categories."

Approximately half of the teacher-researchers involved in this study were also Noyce Scholars, who have committed to teaching in high-need settings. The findings of this study may lead to improved STEM education and educator development by demonstrating the impacts of research experiences for pre-service teachers.

In this NSF funded project, the PI proposes to study singular geometry by analyzing maps into and between them that are optimal in the sense that they minimize energy.  The analysis of these maps will help us understand symmetry properties that exists in certain singular spaces.  The project will advance our scientific knowledge in the understanding of non-singular geometry; in particular, the PI's research will lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.  The project also has an education component and supports diversity by teaching and advising graduate students, post-doc and early career mathematicians especially those that are underrepresented in the STEM fields.  <br/> <br/>A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating.  Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional.  They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parametrized geodesics in Riemannian geometry.  Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space into another.  The celebrated work of Eells and Sampson launched an explosion of research in harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.  Many important applications were found, particularly in minimal surface theory, Teichmuller theory and rigidity questions.  A more recent development is the harmonic map theory for non-smooth spaces.  The seminal works of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen  study energy minimizing maps in the case when the target is an non-positively curved (NPC) space. These energy minimizing maps are referred to as harmonic maps.  The PI will extend this harmonic map theory for singular geometry and to apply it to solve problems in other fields."

This year marks the 33rd anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, the mission of VL/HCC is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2017/.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants to the Graduate Consortium, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women.  To further increase diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from any given institution (and if two, then at least one of them must be from an under-represented group in STEM fields).<br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.

Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Graduate Consortium, the 15th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Graduate Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  The student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive constructive feedback from the faculty participants as well as from the other students.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  This event will therefore promote discovery and learning, while also building community among young researchers working from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  To get feedback from a broader slice of the VL/HCC community, every student participant will present a poster or demo at the Showpieces event during the main conference. A 2-page extended abstract of each student participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings."

The core is a nanoparticle made from a semiconductor, and attached to the core are branched organic molecules called dendrimers. These nanocrystal-dendrimer (NCD) hybrid particles offer promising and superior optical and electronic properties that can be tailored through chemical design of the constituent organic and semiconductor components to manipulate the flow of charge and energy on nanometer length scales.  The NCD platform has potential for broad impact across many fields and applications, including solar cells, solid state lighting and display technology, biological imaging, and photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis.<br/><br/>In this project, inorganic NC donors are functionalized with tailored dendrimer ligands that incorporate molecular acceptors, precisely controlling the acceptor location and orientation to enable fundamental investigations of charge and energy transfer. Studies of these NCD hybrids are greatly advancing understanding of photophysical processes at organic / inorganic interfaces and are establishing new design rules to optimize the coupling between the quantum states of the NCs and the molecular energy levels of the functionalized dendrons. The NCD hybrids harness advances in both organic and inorganic synthesis to offer a new class of solution-processable building blocks to engineer the flow of energy and the separation and transport of charge.  Objectives of this project include synthesizing and characterizing a library of NCD hybrid nanostructures as well as measuring dynamics and understanding mechanisms of ultrafast charge and energy transfer in NCDs.  The broader technical impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the design and discovery of next-generation particles that offer superior performance in optoelectronic and photocatalytic devices.  Broader non-technical impacts include education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to underrepresented groups within the West Philadelphia Promise Zone."

Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) presents a possible method to increase flow of scientific and local knowledge, enhance STEM-based problem solving skills, and co-create new knowledge about phenology at local and regional or larger scales. However, there remain some key challenges that the field of PPSR research must address to achieve this goal. The proposed research will make substantial contributions to two of these issues by: 1) advancing theory on the interactions between PPSR and resilience in social-ecological systems, and 2) advancing our understanding of strategies to increase the engagement of youth and adults historically underrepresented in STEM, including Alaska Native and indigenous youth and their families who play an essential role in the sustainability of environmental monitoring in the high latitudes and rural locations throughout the globe. In particular, our project results will assist practitioners in choosing and investing in design elements of  PPSR projects to better navigate the trade-offs between large-scale scientific outcomes and local cultural relevance. The data collected across the citizen science network will also advance scientific knowledge on the effects of phenological changes on berry availability to people and other animals. <br/><br/>The Arctic Harvest research goals are to 1) critically examine the relationship between PPSR learning outcomes in informal science environments and attributes of social-ecological resilience and 2) assess the impact of two program design elements (level of support and interaction with mentors and scientists, and an innovative story-based delivery method) on the engagement of underserved audiences. In partnership with afterschool clubs in urban and rural Alaska, we will assess the impact of participation in Winterberry, a new PPSR project that investigates the effect of changes in the timing of the seasons on subsistence berry resources. We propose to investigate individual and community-level learning outcomes expected to influence the ability for communities to adapt to climate change impacts, including attributes of engagement, higher-order thinking skills, and their influence on the level of civic action and interest in berry resource stewardship by the youth groups. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we compare these outcomes with the same citizen science program delivered through two alternate methods: 1) a highly supported delivery method with increased in-person interaction with program mentors and scientists, and 2) an innovative method that weaves in storytelling based on elder experiences, youth observations, and citizen science data at all stages of the program learning cycle.  This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.

Cepheid variables are the best known and understood; they populate an area of the HR diagram known as the instability strip.

The project focuses on problems of central importance in a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines, including signal processing, structural biology, and computer vision, that share a similar feature: the need to leverage algebraic structure in order to extract information from data. The project aims at developing a systematic approach to analyze this family of problems, together with a general procedure to construct computationally efficient algorithms using low-rank tensor decomposition. Importantly, these methods can be proved to be statistically optimal and therefore make the most efficient use of collected data."

The investigators will focus on understanding the formation of these clusters, giving us important insights into the entire process of how objects form.   Galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of galaxies and are filled with very hot gas - their atmospheres, or ""intracluster media"". These atmospheres are so hot that most of the light they emit is X-rays that can be seen only from space. Astronomers have established that this hot gas has often been highly disturbed when one cluster violently collides and merges with another cluster. The gas motions can tell us about the collisions and how these largest structures in the universe form. Space X-ray telescopes are limited in their abilities to trace these motions, especially outside the denser cluster centers. As it turns out, however, galaxies scattered throughout clusters spew out streams of highly energetic particles that emit radio waves visible from the earth that reveal their interactions with the intracluster media. The intracluster gas motions can also energize radio emitting particles, illuminating the motions. The investigators will find these radio emissions and map their details, using both new and existing ground based radio telescope observations and utilizing the citizen-science-based ""Radio Galaxy Zoo."" In addition, they will compute detailed physical models to determine how these emissions can be used to trace out the motions of the intracluster media as well as their origins and histories.  The results of these studies will substantially improve our understanding of how galaxy clusters form.<br/><br/><br/>Galaxy clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound systems in the universe. They are filled with 'intracluster media,"" diffuse plasmas with temperatures of 10s of millions of degrees, which are visible from space using X-rays.  The investigators will address three key questions about these media:  1) what is the dynamical state of the gas, its flows, turbulence and shocks? 2) how do these dynamical features help us understand the cluster formation process? and 3) how do we reliably connect the underlying motions with what we can observe?   The investigators will specifically concentrate on behaviors observable at radio wavelengths, using emission from electrons moving at relativistic speeds in the presence of a magnetic field.  This allows them to study regimes such as cluster outskirts, for which very little X-ray information is available.  They will carry out numerical simulations at the technical frontier, coupling the magnetohydrodynamics of the hot gas to the relativistic particles generating the radio emission. They will conduct new state-of-the-art radio telescope observations and analyses, along with information from the citizen science project Radio Galaxy Zoo on distortions of radio-emitting plasmas caused by the hot gas flows.   Together, this work will enable the investigators to gain important information about the cluster formation process, a key piece in the universal picture of how structures in the universe develop over billions of years."

Typical examples of dependent categorical data arise when one studies how the behavioral patterns of people in a social network (say smoking or voting preference) are influenced by their friends. Both types of data have become increasingly common. This project studies modeling schemes for such data aimed at capturing its dependence, which is not assumed to be well understood. The research develops a rigorous understanding of the behavior of these models, which will aid in statistical inferences from data sets of these types.<br/><br/>For the ranking work, the project will study the Mallows model of rankings and its generalizations. Most existing research concentrates on one particular such model, namely the Mallows model with Kendall's tau. This project instead puts forth a general framework based on permutation limit theory to understand the behavior of Mallows models and permutation models in general. For modeling dependent or categorical data, the focus is on Ising models, which originated in statistical physics and have received significant recent attention in statistics and machine learning. The main goal of the research is to develop inference for Ising model parameters that are not computationally prohibitive."

Leading scholars from the U.S., Europe, and Russia will analyze and present papers based on a unique data source -- a series of interviews of high-ranking individuals working in Russia's federal bureaucracy, parliament, military and security agencies, private businesses, state-owned enterprises, universities and academic research institutes, and major media outlets.  The series, conducted on a quadrennial basis since 1993 and extending to 2016, consists of seven waves. It includes 1,664 surveys that feature a consistent survey methodology, the use of the same Moscow-based polling firm, and the replication of most survey questions. These are the only repeated cross-sectional survey data of Russian elites extant anywhere and as such, constitute a unique resource for the scholarly community. The papers written using the data will be published as a co-edited volume that should be of interest to policy experts and academics alike.  By exploring the foreign policy attitudes of a broad swath of Russian elites, the project should promote a deeper understanding of the causes of -- and possible ways to moderate -- Russia's recent belligerence in the post-Soviet region and its confrontational stance toward the West."

To achieve these aims, engineering programs in higher education must guarantee that curricula are both rigorous and equitable. As demand for engineering majors increases, so too do section sizes for foundational engineering courses. There is growing evidence that such courses represent significant barriers to student success and that the penalties associated with large classes can disproportionately affect women and underrepresented groups. Further, these educational environments make it challenging to implement evidence-based teaching practices known to be better for student learning. This project will build a learning organization ecosystem -- a grassroots effort involving engagement between faculty and departmental and institutional support structures to collaboratively identify problems and continuously, systematically improve the quality and equitability of the engineering curricula. During this project, sixteen instructors responsible for teaching approximately 4800 undergraduate engineering students in large foundational courses will be impacted. Beyond the instructors and the students directly impacted, research findings and project outcomes will be shared broadly so that other faculty and administrators might similarly improve their educational enterprise.<br/><br/>This project responds to national calls for undergraduate engineering to become more data-driven by exploring how existing, diverse data sources can be leveraged to enhance educational environments. Early efforts will focus on creating intelligent feedback loops, robust streams of existing institutional data (e.g., historical transcript data, student evaluations), existing instructor-level data (e.g., past exams), and newly collected data (e.g., surveys about how students spend time pre/post high-stakes tests). Such data sources will be triangulated and analyzed in a way that can be used by the instructors and the research team. Summer workshops will also be conducted to engage faculty and administrators in a participatory design process: (1) to build individual instructor action plans and (2) to construct an institutional change action plan collectively. Research efforts center at the intersection of learning analytics and faculty change to inform how others might productively leverage institutional data to improve the STEM undergraduate education system. The research team consists of educational researchers, engineering faculty, and administrative leaders from the college of engineering, institutional effectiveness, and learning sciences. Thus, the team is well-poised to not only lead this effort programmatically and from a research perspective, but also institutionalize project-developed strategies and outcomes."

The membrane allows water to pass through its nanometer size pores at a higher rate compared to dissolved and/or suspended solutes, resulting in purification of the water that passes through the membrane. To achieve even higher water quality, more selective reverse osmosis membranes have sub-nanometer pores, which require higher applied pressure to facilitate water transport across the membrane. There is a general trade-off between permeability of the membrane to water versus impermeability to contaminants: smaller pore sizes retain a broader range of contaminants but decrease water throughput per unit time and/or increases energy consumption; in contrast, larger pore sizes lead to less contaminant rejection but higher water permeability or lower energy consumption. State of the art membranes are made from polymers, for which the spaces between the polymeric chains act as the pores that filter the contaminants. As these pores are formed via the three-dimensional arrangement of polymer chains, the pore size is not easily controlled on a molecular level. Current membranes have a limited lifetime, due to the negative effects of biofouling, mechanical compaction, and chemical degradation. Biofouling is a result of the deposition of organic contaminants and nutrients on the membrane and the subsequent growth of a biofilm that creates a barrier for subsequent water permeation through the membrane; polymer compaction results in pore tightening in the amorphous portion of membranes that leads to reduced water permeability; and chemical degradation is a process exacerbated by the use of harsh chemicals during cleaning of fouled membranes that ultimately results in higher permeability to contaminants. To address these concerns, this project will develop novel membranes that enable a molecular-level design of pore size and shape and the incorporation of fouling-resistant chemical functional groups. <br/><br/>The project capitalizes upon a new interfacial polymerization process that synthesizes covalent organic frameworks in a high-surface area thin polymeric film. Unlike other polymeric materials, these frameworks are highly crystalline with well-defined surface chemistry and a regular pore structure, this regularity enables molecular level design, which in turn will allow for optimized retention of particular solutes combined with high water permeability across the membrane. The frameworks could also be modified to incorporate anti-fouling surface chemistry and to decrease pore size. The key advance of this collaborative project is to develop the thin active covalent organic framework layer in concert with a polymeric support that is stable in the solvents used for the polymerization process and during membrane cleaning. The project scope of work includes synthesis of novel membranes with various building blocks, tuning of pore size and surface chemistry by altering the covalent organic framework, and the identification of solvent stable support media. Various surface analysis techniques will be used for the physicochemical characterization of the resulting membranes, and optimization of the interfacial polymerization process to control the interface between the covalent organic framework and the support. The resulting membranes will be tested for performance with aqueous solutions of model contaminants. This international collaboration, facilitated by an inter-agency agreement between the U.S. and U.K., brings together membrane and polymer synthesis experts from two countries to develop this new class of membranes while building an international research network and providing students with a unique international educational opportunity."

In classical mechanics, the state of a physical system at any given time is described by n position coordinates and n momentum coordinates. These 2n coordinates specify a point in a 2n-dimensional phase space. The phase space has the structure of a symplectic manifold, and understanding the geometry of this symplectic manifold is crucial to understanding how the physical system evolves in time.  This project will investigate closely related notions of ""space"" and ""time"" in symplectic geometry. The ""space"" notion to be studied is that of a symplectic embedding: this is a change of coordinates which preserves the symplectic structure but may make the equations of motion easier to solve. The ""time"" notion to be investigated is that of a Reeb orbit: this describes behavior which repeats in time, such as a planet orbiting around a star.<br/><br/>In order to study symplectic embeddings and Reeb orbits, new technology in various forms of contact homology will be developed. In particular, foundational work will be carried out on cylindrical contact homology and its more generally defined counterpart, positive circle-equivariant symplectic homology. This will lead to new symplectic embedding obstructions. Also, new infrastructure in embedded contact homology (ECH) will be constructed. In particular, a filtration on ECH determined by a transverse knot in a contact three-manifold will be studied, with applications to the dynamics of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms. The ""J-zero"" index on ECH will be further studied with applications to proving the existence of infinitely many Reeb orbits in more cases.  With the help of this machinery, a circle of questions surrounding Viterbo's conjecture, on the uniqueness of normalized symplectic capacities for convex sets, will be investigated. Known symplectic capacities will be compared, and the symplectic significance of convexity will be elaborated. New algorithms for computing symplectic capacities will be developed, in order to enable computer-assisted searches for counterexamples to Viterbo's and related conjectures. Applications of other versions of contact homology to questions in quantitative symplectic geometry will also be explored. These other versions of contact homology include rational symplectic field theory, and possible analogues of ECH in higher dimensions."

This project investigates the intersection of these strategies and how they facilitate the persistence of blue crabs and a pathogenic virus along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The widespread distribution of this crab-virus system makes it useful for investigating host-pathogen interactions. Blue crabs can reduce their activity level and induce winter dormancy in colder climates, but it is unclear how this alters progression and transmission of the pathogen. Conversely, year-round growth and reproduction of tropical blue crabs may be offset by higher pathogen abundance and activity. This project will use a combination of field and laboratory studies to reveal how crab life history and pathogen dynamics interact and adapt at the extremes of their range. Genetic sequencing, crab movement tracking and oceanographic models will be used to understand how crab-disease dynamics vary across temperate and tropical latitudes. The blue crab is an ecologically and economically important species and knowledge generated in this project will help provide management guidance to support sustainable fisheries. Best practices to avoid and limit disease will be communicated to commercial and artisanal harvesters through partnerships and workshops. Local high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be engaged through a variety of formal and informal educational programs. Public outreach will be implemented through a museum partnership with the Shedd Aquarium and will include the training of a science communication intern.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine empirical field and laboratory experiments, population genomics, and biophysical modeling to explore the consequences of latitude-driven changes in life history and oceanic connectivity on a trans-hemispheric pathosystem comprised of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the pathogenic virus, CsRV1. The virulence of the CsRV1 virus from tropical and temperate latitudes and the impact of overwintering will be studied by experimental virus challenges of crabs transplanted between high and low latitudes. The impact of infection and virulence on crab movement will be investigated in laboratory raceway experiments of healthy and infected crabs and in the field with acoustically tagged crabs deployed in temperate and tropical locations. Population genetic studies using thousands of genome-wide RAD sequencing markers for crabs and whole-genome sequencing for the virus will define genetic connectivity of crab and virus populations across their range, and will investigate the possible latitudinal, seascape, and life history-driven changes in blue crab and virus genomes. The two population genomic data sets are expected to provide different inferences and scales of connectivity because CsRV1 virus genotypes are transmitted only among post-larval crabs while blue crab genotypes also move by a potentially long-range dispersive larval stage. Finally, integrated biophysical models will be used to investigate the relative contributions of adult and larval dispersal on the population structure of the crab and the pathogen across a broad swath of habitat between New England and Argentina with a decade of simulations. An open-source Lagrangian stochastic model will estimate pelagic larval transport, and spatially explicit biased-correlated random walk models will estimate adult movement. Models will be informed by experimentally-derived movement and behavior data, as well as information on crab larval and adult behavior and overwintering duration available in the published literature. Under a series of scenarios in which crab behavior is affected by latitude and virus infection, statistical comparisons will be made between biophysical model-based predictions of connectivity and genetic estimates of connectivity. These analyses will advance our understanding of the physical, environmental, and biological factors that shape the dynamics of the blue crab CsRV1 pathosystem."

Emerging cooling technologies, which may address these temperature challenges, are not easily accessible for experimentation to computer engineers. In fact, there is a substantial lag before a cooling technology becomes available for system design and optimization. Such lags cause design quality to be left on the table. To this end, this project proposes a software infrastructure that enables accurate modeling of cutting-edge cooling methods and that facilitates mutually customizing the computing and cooling systems to dramatically push system energy efficiency. <br/><br/>The proposed infrastructure is a system-level design automation tool that includes compact thermal models of emerging cooling methods (thermoelectric coolers, two-phase cooling with microchannels or nanopores, phase-change materials, and single-phase liquid cooling). The project plan includes (1) synthesizing novel device-level models into compact representations; (2) using measurements on prototypes for validation of the proposed models; and (3) developing automation tooling to co-design hybrid customized cooling subsystems together with a given computing system. The broader impact of the project will be to help advance computing beyond the limitations of Moore's Law by making efficient design of high-power-density systems possible. The proposed infrastructure will enable transformative research in design automation, computer architecture, and system design with emerging cooling technologies, particularly in the dimensions of performance, variability, energy, heterogeneity, and cross-layer design.

This behavior stems from a protective atomic-scale protective oxide layer that forms on the surface of stainless steels which if scratched or otherwise breached in some manner reforms within seconds on the surface of the alloy. This self-healing behavior serves as a model for the development modern corrosion protection coating schemes for other families of important alloy systems including aluminum and magnesium. The main objective of the work is to develop simple physically based models for the behavior of stainless steels in order to develop design schemes that can rationalize existing data and identify alloy compositions and atomic-scale effects that can be used to engineer new families of alloys with superior corrosion resistance. The scope of research, which involves laboratory and computational work, affords both undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity for fundamental training in materials electrochemistry and corrosion science. Results of this research are expected to contribute to important issues of national concern connected to both the well being of our infrastructure as well as the development of light-weight metallic alloys used in automotive applications for which corrosion is a major problem.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>While it is well known that 10-13 at.% chromium is required for stainless-like behavior of iron alloys, a long standing unanswered question in corrosion science is why? Early work connected ""critical"" Cr compositions for stainless-like behavior to long-ranged percolation thresholds for random structures but recent density functional calculations that incorporate magnetic interactions have shown that Fe-Cr alloys are unique owing to an inversion in the sign of the heat of mixing occurring at approximately 10 at. % Cr within a solid solution.  Importantly, Mssbauer and neutron scattering studies have confirmed the predictions of these calculations for Fe-Cr alloys and revealed that atomic scale ordering can be ""tuned"" by suitable heat treatment. In order to unravel this mystery the atomic scale structure of Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys  is being examined as a function of composition and short-range order. At fixed alloy composition, short-range order is tuned by varying the heat treatment of the alloy. The work will characterize short-range order by atomic-scale chemical imaging of well-prepared alloy surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy. Computer simulations are performed in order to extract regular solution theory parameters that are then used in Monte Carlo renormalization group calculations to determine how ordering modifies standard percolation thresholds. Electrochemical methods are used to measure how composition and heat treatment affect passivation behaviors in Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys."

Phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide have optical properties that change dramatically at their phase transition temperature. Moreover, nano-photonic materials such as photonic crystals and metamaterials allow fine control over the thermal emission properties. This raises the possibility of designing materials whose absorption and emission spectra that self-adjust with temperature to minimize the temperature variation that they experience due to a changing heat load. Our technical approach will encompass fundamental theory, materials design, and experiment. We will use analytical models to understand the fundamental limits on passive temperature self-regulation in materials with engineered thermal radiation profiles. We will then use accurate electromagnetic models to design nanostructured materials with the desired thermal radiation profiles. We will make these novel materials using nanofabrication methods and test their radiative/emission properties experimentally. We will then test the material's ability to self-regulate their temperature. The outcome of this research will be an improved understanding of materials design for environments with varying heat loads.

Different versions of Question (1) have been studied extensively by game theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, but investigations in theoretical computer science in the last two decades have given renewed interest for Questions (1), (2), and (3).  Generally speaking, theoretical computer science finds ways for computers to solve problems as quickly and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>This project develops two analytic tools in probability: the calculus of variations and curvature.  Several recent isoperimetric problems in probability and theoretical computer science such as (1) and (2) ask for the Euclidean sets of smallest Gaussian perimeter and fixed Gaussian volume.  A breakthrough result of Choksi and Sternberg from 2007 allows the calculus of variations to be applied to these optimization problems, though others have not yet used variational tools for these problems.  The principal investigator will also develop theories of curvature for hypercontractive and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.  For a Riemannian manifold, Ricci curvature bounds imply logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, a result of Bakry and Emery from 1985.

The second major task involves characterizing the morphological and wetting properties as well as the standard MD performance of the fabricated Janus membranes. Lastly, the performance of the Janus membranes will be tested with synthetic and real wastewater to evaluate them in the presence of amphiphilic and hydrophobic contaminants.

This project at Itasca Community College in Minnesota is timely as the current workforce in the region is aging, and it has become recognized by regional industries that a workforce pipeline is needed to maintain current operations and facilitate future growth.  It is designed to develop an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) program in Process Operations that will capitalize on the need these industries have for highly-qualified and motivated employees. The program is a shift from the current industry specific technical programs of the region to a program that is focused on developing graduates who are prepared to be 21st century workers for these industries. This will increase the regional economic vitality and help the college remain a model of progressive instruction. Partners include industries such as Minnesota Power, Lonza, Blandin Paper Company, Marvin Windows and Doors, and American Sugar as well as the high schools in the vicinity of the college. The overall curriculum will be industry driven through its development and will remain responsive to the industrial fluctuations in the region by maintaining and utilizing strong industry ties. The college will become a member of the North American Process Technology Alliance (NAPTA) that can provide curriculum and access to model programs as well as an avenue for project dissemination.<br/><br/>This Associate in Applied Science (AAS) program in process operations will encompass a broad scope of industrial plant operations to educate and motivate future industrial technicians by utilizing a structured learning community to deliver a condensed one-and-a-half year curriculum. To maximize the chance for success, students will be required to have prerequisite courses in industrial safety, welding, machining, fabrication, computing, and mathematics. To provide students multiple pathways, students may enter the program from one of four pathways (a summer boot camp, high school credits developed for this project, industrial work experience, or relevant college courses and experiences.)

The areas of student development and assessment will be technical knowledge (what students know), professionalism (who students are), and process awareness (what students can do). The nationally recognized pre-engineering program at the college will serve as a model for this new AAS Process Operations program. Model tenents will be utilization of Project Based Learning (PBL), industry tours, industry professionals serving as instructors or guest speakers, student learning communities, and student ownership of and pride in the program.

The proposed research addresses the design of these catalysts by employing novel porous structures.  The overarching goal is to reduce exhaust emissions while minimizing impact on fuel economy and reducing the need for precious metals such as Pt and Pd.  The proposed research is an industry-university collaboration between GM Global R&D and the University of New Mexico.  The project will provide opportunities for students and early career researchers to learn about the challenges in implementing new technologies for exhaust emissions control.<br/><br/>The research challenge being addressed here impacts the entire class of heterogeneous catalysts used for meeting the needs for energy, materials and fuels.  Automotive exhaust catalysts are subjected to elevated temperatures that lead to growth of nanoparticle size through Ostwald ripening and to loss of activity.  The research will look into the role of pore structure and chemistry in the transport of mobile species during Ostwald ripening and in the trapping of the mobile species to limit the growth of particles. Model porous catalysts will be synthesized with systematic control of the size of the pores and the connectivity of the pore network.  The transport rates of the mobile species will be studied.  Modifying the surface chemistry can influence the diffusive transport and can also effectively trap the mobile species once they get emitted from nanoparticles. The overall outcome from these model studies is a decrease in particle growth rates due to decreased transport rates in pores. Insights from these model porous catalysts will be translated to powder catalysts and tested under realistic conditions using the facilities of the industry partner. The close participation of industry and university researchers is critical for validating the concepts and models.  GM has committed significant resources in terms of people time and access to facilities, to enable this research to be successful.  The partnership will help address significant unknowns in the understanding of catalyst sintering, and will lead to advances in the synthesis of novel catalysts with improved reactivity and more efficient use of precious metals.<br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)."

It is essential for software effort estimation, risk management, defect prediction, project resource management and many other tasks.  Software analytics is a complex, time-consuming process. Recent research has tried to alleviate the issue through intelligent optimizers that make better use of existing computational resources. The space of possible options for optimization is very large, and spans over multiple layers: all possible settings for algorithms, compilers, and execution time options. To complicate matters, there are many competing goals that could be used to guide that tuning; e.g. reducing CPU usage while increasing the predictive power of the learned model. Existing research has mainly focused on limited optimizers that explore just a few options at mostly one level while trying to improve on just one or two goals, leaving the large potential of optimizations untapped.<br/><br/>This research proposes to advance the state of the art to holistic scalable intelligent optimization for software analytics (SHASA). SHASA tunes all levels of options for multiple optimization objectives at the same time. It achieves this ambitious goal through the development of a set of novel techniques that efficiently handle the tremendous tuning space. These techniques take advantage of the synergies between all those options and goals by exploiting relevancy filtering (to quickly dispose of unhelpful options), locality of inference (that enables faster updates to outdated tunings) and redundancy reduction (that reduces the search space for better tunings). This research will produce algorithms and tools that are demonstrably more useful and efficient for software analytics research. Those techniques are generalizable beyond software analytics for use in computational science and engineering at large. An important broader impact is minimizing CPU and memory usage, ultimately reducing energy consumption in data centers, as data analytics computations grown significantly in scale and become computationally more demanding."

Nearly all higher cognitive functions depend on the activity patterns of cortical neuron populations.  These activity patterns are shaped by the structure of connectivity between cortical neurons and, conversely, cortical connectivity is shaped by cortical activity through changes in connection strengths called ""synaptic plasticity.""  This project will develop novel computational models and mathematical analyses to understand the interplay between cortical connectivity and cortical activity, and how it gives rise to cognitive functions like sensory processing and motor learning.  The results will lead to a better understanding of how the cortex functions and how it dysfunctions in disease states.  The results will also inform the development of biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research and benefit from coursework inspired by the research projects.  Students at a public high school will be guided in a project to incorporate learning algorithms from the research into a robot, providing hands on experience with applied mathematics, computer programming, and robotics.<br/><br/>The project comprises three sub-projects that build on each other.  The first sub-project utilizes the notion of excitatory-inhibitory balance in cortical networks to derive scaling laws for connection strengths at large network size.  Previous theoretical work elucidates the computational utility of an inverse square root scaling law and recent experimental work provides biological evidence for it, but the mechanisms through which the law could emerge are unknown.  Candidate biological mechanisms will be analyzed mathematically and evaluated in collaboration with an experimental neuroscientist.  For the second project, the theory of neuronal networks with excitatory and inhibitory balance will be refined and extended to account for the imprecision of balance observed in experiments.  Preliminary calculations suggest that this imprecision is mathematically necessary, produces biologically realistic activity, and invokes intricate response properties that have implications for artificial neural networks used for image analysis.  The third project will develop and analyze a mathematical model of motor learning that combines Hebbian plasticity in a cortical pathway with reward modulated plasticity in a sub-cortical pathway, inspired by experimental observations.

Taylor Valley is one of the Dry Valleys of the Transantarctic Mountains, which are characterized by low mean annual temperatures, low precipitation, and limited erosion.  These conditions have allowed fragile glacial landforms to be preserved for up to 15 Ma.  Sediment eroded and deposited by glaciers is found on the valley walls and floors, with progressively younger deposits preserved at lower elevations. Scientists can date glacial deposits to understand the process and timing of past glacial erosion.  Previous work in the Dry Valleys region suggested that extremely cold glaciers like Taylor Glacier, a major outlet glacier entering the valleys, were not erosive during the last several million years.  This research will test a new hypothesis that glacial erosion and sediment production beneath Taylor Glacier have been active in the last few million years.  This hypothesis will be tested using a new isotopic dating method called ""comminution dating' which determines when fine-grained sediment particles called silt were formed.  If the sediment age is young, then the results will suggest that glacial processes have been more dynamic than previously thought.  Overall, this study will increase our understanding of the nature and extent of past glaciations in Antarctica.  Because the silt produced by erosion sediment is a nutrient for local ecosystems, the results will also shed light on delivery of nutrients to soils, streams, and coastal zones in high polar regions.  This project will be led by an early career scientist and includes training of a Ph.D. student.  <br/><br/>Atechnical description of the project <br/><br/>There is a long-standing scientific controversy about the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet with much evidence centered in the Dry Valleys region of South Victoria Land.  A prevailing view of geomorphologists is that the landscape has been very stable and that the effects of glaciation have been minimal for the past ~15 Ma.   This project will distinguish between two end-member scenarios of glacial erosion and deposition by Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that terminates in Taylor Valley in the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica.  In the first scenario, all valley relief is generated prior to 15 Ma when non-polar climates enabled warm-based glaciers to incise and widen ancient river channels. In this case, younger glacial deposits record advances of cold-based glaciers of decreasing ice volume and limited glacial erosion, and sediment generation resulted in glacial deposits composed primarily of older recycled sediments. In the second scenario, selective erosion of the valley floor has continued to deepen Taylor Valley but has not affected the adjacent peaks over the last 2 Ma. In this scenario, the ""bathtub rings"" of Quaternary glacial deposits situated at progressively lower elevations through time could be due to the lowering of the valley floor by subglacial erosion and with it, production of new sediment which is now incorporated into these deposits. While either scenario would result in the present-day topography, they differ in the implied evolution of regional glacial ice volume over time and the timing of both valley relief production and generation of fine-grained particles.  <br/><br/>The two scenarios will be tested by placing time constraints on fine particle production using U-series comminution dating. This new geochronologic tool exploits the loss of 234U due to alpha-recoil. The deficiency in 234U only becomes detectable in fine-grained particles with a sufficiently high surface-area-to-volume ratio which can incur appreciable 234U loss.  The timing of comminution and particle size controls the magnitude of 234U loss.  While this geochronologic tool is in its infancy, the scientific goal of this proposal can be achieved by resolving between ancient and recently comminuted fine particles, a binary question that the preliminary modeling and measured data show is readily resolved."

The therapy builds on existing research, which shows that exercising the upper airway can result in a substantial reduction in snoring and sleep apnea. Backed by strong support from scientific literature, the initial work involved partnering with experts in speech therapy and sleep medicine to identify the most effective therapy to strengthen and tone the upper airway, which addresses the root cause of snoring and sleep apnea.

Additionally, it neither poses the environmental risk of releasing elemental mercury, nor does it require restricted disposal as do compact fluorescent bulbs.

Therefore, OLED technology has the potential to dramatically reduce lighting costs and the associated electrical generation preventing the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The availability of a natural scaffold helps improve patient physiological outcomes, and the use of similar pigmentation can improve natural integration with the recipient's existing skin, easing their emotional recovery and self-image.  There is a growing demand for such engineered allografts in surgeries, including breast reconstruction. The incidence of breast cancer diagnosis has been increasing rapidly in the united states. Furthermore, the last few decades have seen an increasing trend for women to undergo a double mastectomy for preventative measures, even if breast cancer was only detected in one breast. Such procedures require complete reconstruction of both breasts. In 2015, there were 176,308 breast reconstructions and this number is expected to continue rising. This process technology will help meet some of this demand by improving the production of scaffolds, and may lead to new methods by which individuals planning surgeries can have their own tissue processed and reused in their procedures (autograft).<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will develop a scaffold for nipple regeneration derived from human nipple areolar complex tissue. Currently, the best option for nipple reconstruction required in breast reconstruction is cutting and suturing the skin on the breast to create a scar mound with a subsequent tattoo for desired pigmentation that recreates the appearance of a nipple.  Unfortunately, this method results in nipple flattening due to retraction forces of the underlying tissue and contraction of scar tissue. Instead of just recreating the appearance of a nipple, like current reconstruction methods, our engineering process technology allows the patient to have a scaffold assist in the regeneration of a nipple made from her own cells. Portions of the scaffold processing we are developing have been demonstrated in a laboratory setting.   Advantages of this technology include improved cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration when the scaffold is repopulated with cells from the patient. It is highly desirable to maintain native tissue composition when engineering tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine applications, and recent studies have demonstrated that superior function and complex tissue formation occurred when such scaffolds were derived from site-specific homologous tissues."

The discovery and understanding of electronic phenomena on the mesoscale can in principle lead to the development of novel miniature electronic devices and technologies. Fundamental understanding of the fundamental limits set by nature on the transfer of electromagnetic, thermal and optical signals in mesostructures, together with the emerging capability to quantitatively describe how interactions among electrons, design, interplay of novel materials, and material imperfections converge to affect or optimize electronic phenomena are foundational to future device operation and associated technologies. This project aims to investigate electronic conduction through nanoscale circuits where dominant effects require quantum mechanics for their description, and to study properties of novel materials systems discovered that display many remarkable quantum mechanical effects. These materials include graphene, classes of superconductors which can conduct electricity without loss, and topological materials. Topological materials include topological insulators which are insulators in the bulk of the material but can conduct electricity on the surfaces or edges, and Weyl semimetals which have electrons that appear to be massless and have a ""handedness"" derived from the direction of their motion relative to the direction of intrinsic magnetism of the electron. The PI will also investigate topological materials that can be engineered from ordinary superconductor and semiconductor materials. Engineered topological materials may enable the realization of topological quantum computing. <br/>The PI will engage public and high-school student audiences through a multifaceted outreach science program that includes coaching high-school students for Science Olympiad interscholastic competitions, and organizing Wisconsin Science Experience, an open house in which the public can come to learn about the research and teaching at the Physics Department. The Physics Fair will include laboratory tours, hands-on demonstrations, activities for kids and families, and informal conversations with scientists.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This award supports theoretical research and education to advance understanding of the interplay of quantum coherence and electron interactions in mesoscopic systems, a fundamental problem at the heart of condensed matter physics. Decisively the most important concepts of the present day are related to topological symmetries, orders and emergent quantum states of strongly correlated electrons. The central goal of this project is to investigate how the interplay of interactions, disorder and band topology manifest in anomalous quantum transport specific to novel multiband materials and multilayered heterostructures. The first research objective of this project is to develop a hydrodynamic theory of charge, spin and energy transport in modern nanoelectronic devices.  The second thrust of the project is to develop theory of optical response in unconventional superconductors, and photogalvanic phenomena in Weyl semimetals and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. The third area of work is devoted to revealing peculiarities of anomalous Josephson and proximity effects in quantum circuits of topological insulators and superconductors. The final objective is to develop a nonequilibrium theory of superconducting states with competing orders and extend Keldysh field theoretic approach to describe unconventional classes of topological insulators and superconductors.  <br/>The proposed work will advance our understanding of electron transport in an actively studied class of topologically nontrivial conductors, Weyl semimetals, superconductors and hybrid nanosystems based upon them. The work on hydrodynamic transport is motivated by recent experiments in graphene, and may be useful to graphene device applications. The research on competing phases in correlated materials and the discovery of novel ways of tuning and controlling them may be impactful for the development of new superconductor based technologies. Apart from the fundamental interest and importance, research devoted to topological states of matter may have transformative implications for the realization of novel quantum computation capabilities. <br/>The research will have a broad impact on science students, and public audience through an extensive public science engagement program and outreach activities that include a interscholastic Science Olympiad for high-school students."

From an economic perspective, farmers want to minimize expenditures on nutrients. There is a need by farmers to increase below ground drainage through installation of tiles, perforated plastic pipes, and thus increase production. Tile placement and integrity, coupled with existing data on soil type and characteristics, have a critical impact on the hydrology and fertility of fields, affecting plant growth, the need for fertilizer/nutrients, pesticide and other types of applications. Precise knowledge of a three dimensional view of the land will enable farmers to make appropriate decisions about the application of fertilizers, micro-nutrients, pesticides, etc. to minimize cost, maximize revenue and do as little harm as possible to the ecosystem in which the farm exists. Bringing together data layers of agricultural fields along with information on tile drains will allow the agricultural industry to optimize production through proper placement and repair of tiles while controlling nutrient use and loss.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project uses remote sensing techniques with aerial imagery to provide information precisely identifying the location of drain tiles buried beneath farm fields. Farmers have expressed that knowledge of the location of tile reduces their costs when tile fail and need repair and also helps when additional tile are added to a field improving drainage. In previous work, it was found that fertilizers applied to agricultural fields will pass through the soil and exit a field through tile drains to the surface water system. This I-Corps project uses remote sensing algorithms to detect tile drains below the soil. The technique utilizes the reflectance of the soil as well as the linear shape expressed on the soil surface that indicates tiles within fields. The information generated through this project is unique and much needed by the agricultural industry to better utilize land in crop production ""precision farming""."

In practice, network models are used to address such diverse applications as wireless communication, energy distribution, and conservation planning.  A network consists essentially of a set of ""nodes"", linked in some fashion by ""arcs"".  Connectedness is often a critical feature of a functioning network. However, enforcing connectivity in standard network optimization formulations remains a significant computational challenge.  This project considers new formulations that address node-connectivity constraints directly.  Results from this project are expected to allow for the solution of large-scale instances of these problems to optimality in a reasonable amount of time.  The PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate students, and through collaboration with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), students from underrepresented populations will be provided the opportunity to participate in the research activities. Results from the project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop fundamental theoretical and algorithmic advances for effectively imposing connectivity constraints in mixed integer programming (MIP) models in which the key decisions are at the vertex (i.e., node) level. Previous MIP-based approaches to solve vertex-centric connectivity problems use additional edge (and possibly flow) variables, which overburden commercial solvers, or rely on simple, weak inequalities, leading to the exploration of a large number of branch-and-bound nodes. This research is expected to overcome these limitations through two broad research tasks: (1) developing a rich body of knowledge about connectivity polyhedra in the space of vertex variables, and (2) designing efficient algorithms for solving related problems by exploiting this polyhedral information.  It is expected that the research will also allow for significant improvements in solving hop-constrained and survivable network design problems."

As additive manufacturing transitions from a prototyping tool to manufacturing solution, the demand for fast, inexpensive, and dynamic 3D printing solutions will continue to grow. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of integrating with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems and processing raw plastic pellets (resin) directly into a final part, unlike existing FDM technologies that require a filament feedstock. Raw pelletized plastics are typically a tenth to hundredth the cost of comparable filaments, which allow for significantly lower costs per print. In addition, the proposed solution is capable of printing a wide variety of plastics that are very difficult to print with existing extruders, including thermoplastic elastomers and polymer composites. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of significantly faster production than existing FDM technologies, which will enable high turnover of design prototypes and production parts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on prior NSF-funded research involving a design framework for biomimetic elasto-fluidic systems. The research inspired the invention of a novel technology for manufacturing elasto-fluidic actuators, which forms the basis of this I-Corps project.

The intent is to implement the extruder with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems in a FDM additive manufacturing process. The invention of the Resin Mini-Extruder was motivated by the need to print materials that existing FDM technologies are incapable of processing, namely thermoplastic elastomers. A goal of this I-Corps project is to determine whether customers demand broader material variety from FDM and if so, which materials and composites are preferred. The I-Corps process will also be used to determine the extent at which the other technology advantages are valued among customers, including cost per print and print speed, in particular applications."

This project will test the impact of a simple but potentially effective curricular change in large, introductory courses with a goal of improving non-science major student engagement in STEM by introducing student-produced audio narrative assignments to the curriculum. Student-produced audio narratives (SPAN) are assignments in which students engage with geoscience content by telling a scientific story using simple audio recording and production techniques. The overall goal of using of SPAN in STEM courses is to develop methods that will change the learning environment so that students feel an increased personal connection to STEM, particularly in the geosciences. <br/><br/>SPAN assignments are ideally suited to the challenges of introductory courses, such as large classes, minimal laboratory materials/access, and limited faculty support, especially in underserved programs. This pedagogical approach has the potential to positively impact students' perceptions of geosciences, and science in general, and to increase their engagement with the learning environment. The research team will develop a collaborative and iterative implementation model with a regional Partner Faculty network and embedded assessment. In the first semester, Partner Faculty (focused in the mid-Atlantic region) receive training on technical and storytelling aspects of audio production and developing audio assignments tailored to their own classes. Partner Faculty will implement the assignments over the next three semesters. This project explores and implements the tool of student audio production, develops an implementation model though a Partner Faculty network, and measures the learning outcomes using mixed methods to research students' perception of and engagement in science. A collaborative regional network of faculty will design and implement student-produced audio narratives in their introductory-level classes, including at two-year community colleges. This project creates and tests flexible, adaptable assignments incorporating student-produced audio narratives. Finally, it researches the impact of student-produced audio narratives on students' perceptions of their learning environment and attitudes toward science using novel educational research methods."

Cellulosic ethanol is produced from agricultural waste products, like corn stalks, switchgrass, and wheat straw, rather than from corn like traditional ethanol. It is then used largely as a fuel additive, though other industries use ethanol on smaller scales. Improving cellulosic ethanol production is part of the United States' Renewable Fuel Standards Goals set in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These improvements are vital since the increased demand for ethanol from corn has contributed to rises in food prices.  In addition, cellulosic ethanol produces fewer greenhouse gases than corn ethanol production, and reduces pressure for water use and land change erosion. However, despite these advantages, the vast majority of ethanol produced in the US is from corn, simply because cellulosic ethanol is considerably more expensive to produce. The costs reductions from the process developed here will potentially be of considerable commercial value to existing cellulosic ethanol producers, as well as potentially to corn ethanol producers who may switch production methods if costs become comparable.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a technology that stabilizes genomes of metabolically active yeast. A key step in cellulosic ethanol production, co-metabolism of five- and six-carbon sugars, can be achieved by yeast hybrids consisting of species that ferment one or the other carbon source. But yeast hybrids created by protoplast fusion are genetically unstable, being subject to rapid segregational loss of one or the other parental genome. Preliminary data indicate that genomic instability can be prevented by encapsulating hybrids in calcium alginate and can produce ethanol at near-theoretical yields for weeks on end. This technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It has already been used to study aging, and could be further used to improve plasmid retention in the production of diverse synthetic biology products, including insulin, anti-malarial drugs, and industrially important solvents and lubricants. Current research is focused on optimizing this method for cellulosic ethanol production, with plans in place to subsequently address these other markets."

These catalysts are anticipated to have key features of enzymes such as selective binding of the substrate via non-covalent forces, correct positioning of appropriate functional groups within the active site for optimal reactivity, and preferential binding of the substrate over the product. Catalytic efficiency and selectivity is maximized through systematic tuning of the size and shape of the active sites, as well as the type and the position of the catalytic groups in the active sites."

The speed and flexibility of these devices provide advantages over slower, manually operated fixtures, especially when working in and around complex geometries or fragile environments.  The intellectual property consists of a unique joint surface that permits the mechanical arm to be made much longer and stronger than competing systems.  A first generation system that operates as a surgical retractor was built and demonstrated before surgeons in mock scenario in a hospital operating room.  It was shown to be capable of providing adequate retraction force for abdominal surgeries."

Mathematically, these phenomena can be modeled by partial differential equations (PDE) with both nonlocal and nonlinear terms. This project is devoted to the study of a variety of nonlocal equations arising in fluid mechanics and biology, such as the two-dimensional Boussinesq equation arising in the study of atmospheric fronts and oceanic circulation; the aggregation equation, which models the collective behavior of animal groups; and a two-species system motivated by coral broadcast spawning. Many fundamental mathematical questions about solutions of the equations under the investigation in this project are unanswered. Nonetheless, the equations and their numerical solutions are widely used for understanding and prediction of natural phenomena. This research aims to enhance confidence in the validity of these equation for modeling natural phenomena and to provide a firm theoretical foundation for applications. The goal of this project is to rigorously study whether solutions to nonlocal equations can form a singularity in finite time, and what is the long-time dynamics if the solutions do exist globally in time. <br/><br/>This project contains three different but related directions of research on the singularity and asymptotics for nonlocal PDEs. The first direction concerns finite-time singularity formation in fluid equations. For some variations of the two-dimensional inviscid Boussinesq equation, the goal is to use the ""hyperbolic flow scenario"" to construct a solution that blows up in finite time at a boundary point. The second subproject is devoted to a nonlocal PDE with a gradient flow structure, where particles/individuals tend to repulse each other in short distance and attract each other in long distance. The question is whether in the long run solutions converge to a global minimizer of a certain energy functional, or dissipate to zero. The third direction deals with a two-species system, where two densities evolve under diffusion, reaction and chemotaxis, and the goal is to investigate how the chemotaxis term would affect the long time dynamics of this system. In each of these directions, the investigator plans to apply and develop various analysis tools such as energy methods, gradient flow theory, and comparison principle methods to analyze the dynamical features of the solutions. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDEs and related applications, and will also provide education and training to students in this active field."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression. Large-scale human patient datasets of pancreatic lesions, provided by our consultants through a separately funded project, will be used to validate and refine the models. The project will enhance the cross disciplinary training of students."

Many are sufficiently abundant that they are important forest pests. However, little is known about how shelters affect the survival of the caterpillars and ultimately their egg production as adults. This project will provide information on the impact that shelters have on caterpillar survival and adult success. First, the project tests how much protection shelters provide from high temperatures and low humidity.  This information will help determine how sensitive the caterpillars are to their environment, clarifying how changes in local and global climate might influence the success of shelter-building species. Second, the project will test the protective effects of shelters against predatory insects and spiders, and against parasitic wasps and flies. Specifically, the experiments will determine whether caterpillars whose shelters provide better protection against predators are more vulnerable to parasitic insects. Both predators and parasitic insects are used to control pest insects, so testing this hypothesis could be applied to pest management. Because the research site is in Costa Rica, the researchers will also increase awareness of an under-studied tropical habitat (tropical dry forests) and foster international connections and training.<br/><br/>The researchers will perform two sets of experiments using caterpillar species that cooperatively build group shelters, in which two to ten caterpillars can be found living together. Both sets of experiments will be conducted in the natural forest habitat of the caterpillars. The first experiment will measure the effects of shelters and the environment on caterpillar survival for four species. Caterpillars, along with temperature and humidity sensors, will be placed both inside and outside caterpillar shelters. Caterpillar survival will be monitored to determine whether the caterpillars are protected from the outside environment by their shelters. The second experiment will measure the costs and benefits of building and sharing group shelters for two caterpillar species. Caterpillars will be allowed to build shelters either alone or in groups, and the mortality caused by predators and parasitic insects will be measured. If some treatments are less likely to be killed by predators, the researchers will test whether the caterpillars are also more likely to be attacked by parasitic insects. The positive and negative effects of sharing a shelter with other caterpillars will also be measured by weighing the pupae of surviving caterpillars. Heavier pupae become adults who generally produce more offspring, so this measure will allow the researchers to determine whether sharing a shelter has a negative effect (due to competition with other caterpillars) or a positive one (due to sharing the costs of building and maintaining the shelter)."

As massive amounts of medical imaging and genome sequencing data are now being collected, these questions can be investigated by combining neuroscientists' and biologists' expertise with powerful data analysis tools geared towards addressing the subtlety and uncovering hidden patterns in the data. This project aims to develop an integrated toolkit of scalable, robust, and theoretically sound nonparametric and semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of complex biological systems. It addresses the resolution of two major problems.  The first problem considers massive amounts of high-dimensional complex-structured data that possess complex generating distributions and interrelationships, which often cannot be captured by simple linear systems. Such data are usually noisy and contain numerous outliers.  The second problem considers data exhibiting temporal and spatial correlations and a relatively weak signal. Assuming independent and identically distributed data could lead to erroneous estimation and prediction, giving rise to inaccurate interpretation of biological systems. This project aims to provide methods to solve both of these problems.<br/><br/>This research project puts forward new methods for effective analysis of biological systems, handling the aforementioned challenges in a unified fashion. One essential feature is the concept of large-scale robust nonparametric/semiparametric inference. In particular, the project aims to develop an integrated toolkit of methods that are: (1) easily scalable to high-dimensional data with a large sample size; (2) robust to data modeling assumptions and different kinds of data contaminations; (3) built in a nonparametric or semiparametric sense, where the corresponding generative models contain infinite-dimensional components that capture the data information or subtlety as much as possible. To illustrate, the investigator intends to construct, explore, and apply high dimensional generalized regression models, (generalized) partially linear models, shape-constrained regression models, and copula time series models, among others, to unveil hidden patterns in biological systems. The methods under development are designed to be optimal, namely, attaining either a nonparametric minimax or a semiparametric lower efficiency bound."

However, we are increasingly unable to meet this need, and water scarcity is now considered one of the most serious global challenges of this century. A key problem is the lack of low-cost and high-efficiency technologies for water purification. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Drs. Vojislava Pophristic and Zhiwei Liu at the University of the Sciences are designing highly permeable and selective water channels that will significantly improve water filtration by allowing the passage of water, while blocking salts and other impurities. The channels are cylindrical hollow helices that are formed by assembly of specific chemical building blocks. The group first designs the channel on the computer by creating and optimizing the building block sequences. The promising candidates are then made in the laboratory and tested by experiments. This project is a training ground for students at a science-focused university, a community college and one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).<br/><br/>The project builds upon the group's development of computational approaches for accurate structure and dynamics prediction of arylamide foldamers. The arylamide scaffolds form stable single or duplex helices of application-appropriate lengths and inner cavity dimensions. The modularity and tunability of arylamide foldamers make them excellent candidates for the design of water transport channels by mimicking structural characteristics of aquaporins. The group designs water channels by establishing sequence-structure-function relationship using rational and combinatorial sequence generation and molecular dynamics simulations, followed by optimization for selectivity. The project includes an international collaboration with Dr. Ivan Huc, who experimentally verifies computationally obtained structures and measures water/ion/proton conductivities. An important aspect to this project is that it helps us understand naturally occurring filtration processes, such as selective water transport by aquaporins, which play a critical role in human health."

This pedagogical approach has the potential to positively impact students' perceptions of geosciences, and science in general, and to increase their engagement with the learning environment. The research team will develop a collaborative and iterative implementation model with a regional Partner Faculty network and embedded assessment. In the first semester, Partner Faculty (focused in the mid-Atlantic region) receive training on technical and storytelling aspects of audio production and developing audio assignments tailored to their own classes. Partner Faculty will implement the assignments over the next three semesters. This project explores and implements the tool of student audio production, develops an implementation model though a Partner Faculty network, and measures the learning outcomes using mixed methods to research students' perception of and engagement in science. A collaborative regional network of faculty will design and implement student-produced audio narratives in their introductory-level classes, including at two-year community colleges. This project creates and tests flexible, adaptable assignments incorporating student-produced audio narratives. Finally, it researches the impact of student-produced audio narratives on students' perceptions of their learning environment and attitudes toward science using novel educational research methods."

However, phenotypic differences can also result from the effects of different environmental conditions on development. The researchers will use a combination of physiological experiments and genomic analyses to identify whether color and size differences in western fence lizards are a consequence of natural selection or phenotypic plasticity. Results will provide critical insights into the role and evolutionary advantages of environmentally dependent phenotypic differences in heterogeneous environments. In addition, the project includes day-long educational workshops targeting young girls interested in STEM fields and development of an interactive exhibit on lizards for a local museum.<br/><br/>This study focuses on a phenotypic cline in the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. By combining techniques from genomics, functional ecology, and transcriptomics, this research will develop a comprehensive picture of the origin and function of high elevation phenotypes in western fence lizards. The researchers plan to evaluate the influence of temperature and day length on juvenile phenotypes, and to identify candidate genomic regions implicated in phenotypic differentiation. Juvenile lizards will be reared in a laboratory common garden experiment with treatments that mimic conditions at high and low elevation. This experimental design will decouple the genetic and environmental constituents of phenotype, and also shed light on the functional implications of trait differences. By comparing gene expression profiles of lizards reared in native and non-native conditions, fixed and plastic responses to environmental conditions at both organismal and genomic levels will be identified."

The project investigates the commercialization potential of nanomaterial-enhanced high-performance lithium ion batteries for such applications as small satellites, remote sensing devices, and unmanned vehicle applications, where performance is paramount.  The desired use of these specific applications is often severely limited by the mass or volumetric energy density of commercial-of-the-shelf batteries.  Providing a rechargeable battery with improved energy density would enable longer missions, expanded sensing capability, and a larger communication range in these applications, and presumably a host of other portable electronic systems. An initial focus of the investigation with be within the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, whose use of such technologies has expanded dramatically over the past several years.  Successful commercialization of these batteries will provide the U.S. with improved protection and monitoring systems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project exploits the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of conventional lithium ion batteries. The project further develops energy dense lithium ion battery electrodes through the combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), high capacity active materials, and high areal capacity loadings.  This combination increases the relative mass of active to inactive materials that can store lithium in the cell, thus increasing its energy density.  In addition, the technology offers ancillary improvements in cycle life and suppression of the fading that occurs with increased charge/discharge rates.  This performance relies on the incorporation of CNTs as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than conventional carbons, like carbon black and graphite, enabling improved mechanical properties and a more effective means of providing electrical percolation. The use of CNTs additives enables thicker electrodes, with more active material by volume, and a more efficient use of the active materials."

It has long been assumed that the carbon stored in soil represents the ""leftovers"" - plant-derived compounds that cannot be broken down any further by soil microorganisms. Recent work has shown that, as soil microorganisms decompose plant materials, they can produce compounds that increase carbon storage in soil. Thus, soil microorganisms are important to both the breakdown and the buildup of soil carbon. Many questions, however, remain unanswered.  What controls microbial growth, and which aspects of microbial growth should lead to long-term soil carbon storage? These are the questions to be addressed by research through this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant. Experiments will make use of a novel technique to measure rates of microbial production in both a controlled laboratory experiment, and through studies along natural environmental gradients in forests. Results of this project will further our understanding of soil carbon content, and will enhance our ability to predict when and where carbon storage in soils should be greatest. The investigators will work with high school teachers to develop lesson plans and course materials, as well as with high school students directly, to provide training centered around the project objectives. <br/><br/>The conversion of organic inputs into microbial products is fundamentally controlled by three processes: microbial growth rate, microbial growth efficiency, and microbial turnover rate. Yet, despite the theoretical importance of these parameters for stable soil organic matter (SOM) formation, little is known about how these parameters vary with resource availability and environmental conditions, and which of these parameters most strongly controls SOM dynamics. This research will address two questions: 1) How do litter quality and soil properties affect microbial growth rate, efficiency, and turnover? 2) To what extent do changes in these parameters influence SOM formation and soil carbon storage? To date, our understanding of microbial growth physiology has been hindered by the inability of common methods to quantify growth on realistic substrates. To overcome this challenge, the researchers will use a new, substrate-independent method - tracking 18O-labeled water into microbial DNA - to quantify microbial growth parameters in temperate forest soils. First, microbial growth rate, efficiency, and turnover will be quantified across natural gradients of resource availability in six temperate forests in order to determine whether these parameters are consistent with previously-collected SOM data from these same sites. Then, using two isotopically labeled litter decay experiments, the importance of litter quality versus soil properties in controlling microbial growth parameters and the conversion of plant inputs into stable SOM will be evaluated."

The repetition frequency of the breakdowns in this innovative approach can be controlled by the geometry of discharge electrodes and surroundings.

The dwindling phosphorus supplies negatively impact crop growth and agricultural sustainability.  Chemists worldwide are focused on devising new molecular strategies to meet the food needs of a growing population.  Professor Bowman-James and her students at the University of Kansas are focusing on gaining insight into phosphorus chemistry while addressing the adverse chemical issues associated with phytate, one of the key phosphorus-containing molecules found in soils.  Broader impacts of this project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Kansas, as well as international student exchanges. Collaborators include a soil scientist, Professor Ganga Hettiarachchi, at Kansas State University, and two international researchers, Professor Carlos Kremer at the University of the Republic in Uruguay, and Professor Antonio Bianchi at the University of Florence in Italy. <br/> <br/>Phytate (myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) is a relatively small, but chemically complex, organic molecule loaded with six phosphates.  It is a major scavenger of metal nutrients.  Unfortunately, many of its salts with metal ion nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and calcium, are insoluble, resulting in its classification as an antinutrient.  Phytate also holds a significant amount of much-needed phosphorus hostage within its molecular structure.  With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Prof. Bowman-James and coworkers are designing molecules to assist in releasing captured metal ion nutrients and to probe phytate?s phosphate chemistry.  This research combines supramolecular host-guest and metal ion chemistry tactics to provide new ways to manipulate the physical and chemical properties of phytate.  Goals are to gain a better understanding of phytate and phosphate chemistry at the molecular level.  Aims 1 and 2 provide an in-depth structural profile of phytate and its different conformational forms.  Nutrient insolubility and delivery issues are being addressed by using noncyclic and cyclic chelates to complex phytate via supramolecular hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions, in addition to overcoming phytate?s adverse properties.  Aim 3 strives to probe the phosphoryl transfer chemistry of phytate by exploring the use of polyamine-containing macrocycles as catalysts for phosphate hydrolysis and other phosphatase activity.  X-ray crystallography and multi-nuclear, multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy for both solid state and solution chemistry, respectively, are playing major roles in elucidating the physical and chemical properties of phytate in all three aims."

However, attempts to link specific variants to the selected traits have largely failed. Novel genetic panels and behavioral paradigms for Drosophila melanogaster now make it possible to better understand natural variants that are important for these traits on a genomic scale. The objectives of this proposal are addressed through two specific aims. Aim 1: Fully characterize loci that are important for Place learning and memory. Aim 2: Determine whether specific genetic loci that impact Place learning and memory also influence Olfactory learning and memory. To achieve these aims, a newly developed high-resolution quantitative genetic panel is applied to a set of behavioral problems that have traditionally been examined separately and with different approaches. Different from previous work, this program examines learning and memory in both classical and operant conditioning paradigms to test the hypothesis that there are common core natural genetic variants that influence learning and memory in general. By identifying and validating key genetic variants that influence place and olfactory learning and memory, the proposed experiments significantly improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of learning and memory in natural populations. Results provide critical insights into the natural genetic variants that influence learning and memory in multiple contexts, and into the evolution of learning and memory."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression.

An innovative wheelchair attachment called Gait Rehab Adaptive Machine guides the user's legs through a therapeutic walking movement and drives the wheelchair.  This converts therapy into movement of the chair to give patients the opportunity to work on their own rehabilitation in a compelling way, all from a safely seated position.  The support of natural leg movement without the additional demand of load bearing and balance promotes muscle tone and blood circulation that are critical to organ health.  The connection to mobility promotes patient involvement, fitness, independence and well-being.  The system is instrumented to monitor daily performance.  This extends the reach of therapists to assist recovery from sports injuries, strokes and accidents. It also provides basic mobility for the elderly and walking disabled that promotes leg movement and exercise and it can provide valuable leg exercise in confined spaces such as during long distance airline flights.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores commercialization of robotics technology that has resulted from new capabilities in computer-aided invention.  Given the requirements of the natural movement of the foot and leg of a patient, an articulated six-bar linkage skeleton that guides this movement was computed by evaluation of millions of alternatives and optimized to provide an effective mechanical system.  The result is low-cost versatile wheelchair attachment that connects to a patients legs and guides them through a therapeutic walking movement. This movement is coupled to the drive wheels of the wheelchair and converts their therapy into movement of the chair in all ways needed for daily life (forwards, backwards, and turning).   Mobility motivates increased therapeutic movement which increases its effectiveness.  The technology of computer-aided invention also ensures that the six-bar skeleton can be matched to the specific needs of individual users of various sizes as well as adjusted to provide specialized rehabilitation needs."

Vaccination is a critical tool for the control of infectious diseases, and new vaccine technologies are needed to address challenges resulting from new emerging infectious diseases and increased restrictions on the use of antibiotics. They are essential for increasing global animal protein production to meet the demand of the growing human population. Nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvant technology can enhance the performance and safety of vaccines used in food animals. The incorporation of this technology in licensed vaccines will improve animal health and well-being, help to reduce economic losses caused by infectious diseases, and decrease reliance on antibiotics. As many infectious diseases, like influenza, can be transmitted from animals to people, control of these diseases is also critical for the protection of public health.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a new plant-derived nanoparticle adjuvant technology. Adjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccine formulations to enhance the protective immune response. Current vaccine adjuvants have a number of challenges including lack of efficacy with certain vaccine antigens, instability, non-biodegradable ingredients, and association with adverse effects. Nanoparticles are attractive candidates for new generation vaccine adjuvants, but many nanoparticles are synthesized chemically in the lab, expensive to produce, and difficult to scale up to meet the need of mass vaccinations. Certain varieties of plants have naturally occurring alpha-D-glucan nanoparticles that can be modified to give them immunostimulatory properties. The surface properties of the nanoparticles enables effective activation of immune cells, which contributes to the strong immune protection induced by the vaccines. The fact that the particles naturally exist in plants makes their preparation affordable and easy to scale up, and suitable for use in vaccines. In addition, the naturally occurring particles are stable in formulation, but biodegradable following injection minimizing possible adverse reactions associated with vaccine adjuvants."

In particular, this I-Corps project aims to identify a customer base for a novel biosensing technology using printed floating-gate transistors (FGTs). FGTs are a platform-technology that can be used to detect any analyte that can be captured using an antibody or a special sequence of single-stranded DNA, known as a DNA aptamer. The most likely direction for commercialization is gluten detection. The growing industry of gluten-free foods is valued at $2.8 billion/year. These foods are critical to people suffering from celiac disease, which affects 1% of the population. The FGT platform can also be adapted to other allergens, clinically relevant proteins, or even microorganisms. The continued advancement and commercialization of this technology thus has broader impacts in food safety, and potentially for biomedical and clinical environments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is motivated by the development of a new transistor-based sensing strategy that combines printed electronic and microfluidic technologies. Existing transistor-based sensing technologies pose a difficult materials science problem, wherein the transistor material needs to have outstanding electronic properties as well as stability in the biosensing environment. In contrast, the sensor electronics in the technology under development here are decoupled from the fluidic environment through a side-gate architecture. Published research has established that this platform can detect DNA and proteins. It is thus a flexible platform for biosensing. The research in this project focuses on customer discovery to identify promising directions for commercialization. The initial customer discovery will focus on the food safety industry, with the aim of determining whether gluten detection is the optimal entry point to this market. Subsequent activities will broaden the customer discovery efforts to identify targets in the biomedical and clinical areas."

The research group of Professor Richard Jordan is developing a new generation of metal catalysts that can incorporate other kinds of small molecules into the polyethylene chains, to produce plastics with improved properties, including increased toughness, superior resistance to penetration by gases and chemicals, and enhanced biodegradability. This project is contributing to the development of human resources in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through the education of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates and high school students.

""Pd cage"" catalysts polymerize ethylene to ultra-high-molecular-weight linear polyethylene (MW > 10^6 Da) and copolymerize ethylene with vinyl fluoride with tenfold-higher comonomer incorporation than can be achieved with mononuclear catalysts. This research is harnessing the power of programmed molecular self-assembly to synthesize exceptionally robust Pd cage structures that maintain their integrity at high temperature and function as single-site polymerization catalysts. The targets include assemblies based on OPO2- ligands that contain sulfonate groups with enhanced basicity to strengthen the Li&#9472;O interactions in the cage, ""expanded"" cages that incorporate additional ions to provide supplementary bonding interactions, ""strapped"" cages in which covalent links between OPO2- ligands provide high stability, and catalysts based on Zn-phosphonate cages that are inherently more robust than Li-sulfonate cages.

Student-produced audio narratives (SPAN) are assignments in which students engage with geoscience content by telling a scientific story using simple audio recording and production techniques. The overall goal of using of SPAN in STEM courses is to develop methods that will change the learning environment so that students feel an increased personal connection to STEM, particularly in the geosciences. <br/><br/>SPAN assignments are ideally suited to the challenges of introductory courses, such as large classes, minimal laboratory materials/access, and limited faculty support, especially in underserved programs. This pedagogical approach has the potential to positively impact students' perceptions of geosciences, and science in general, and to increase their engagement with the learning environment. The research team will develop a collaborative and iterative implementation model with a regional Partner Faculty network and embedded assessment. In the first semester, Partner Faculty (focused in the mid-Atlantic region) receive training on technical and storytelling aspects of audio production and developing audio assignments tailored to their own classes. Partner Faculty will implement the assignments over the next three semesters. This project explores and implements the tool of student audio production, develops an implementation model though a Partner Faculty network, and measures the learning outcomes using mixed methods to research students' perception of and engagement in science. A collaborative regional network of faculty will design and implement student-produced audio narratives in their introductory-level classes, including at two-year community colleges. This project creates and tests flexible, adaptable assignments incorporating student-produced audio narratives.

Currently, many small to medium manufacturers cannot afford long-term simulation software due to high licensing and operating costs. To ensure durability, they rely heavily on a series of full-scale physical tests. Manufacturers who can afford existing software suites still utilize extensive physical testing, as simulation results are not solely adequate. This innovative technology allows for intelligent design changes and improvements to be implemented prior to prototyping and testing at an affordable rate for all manufacturers. This can significantly reduce the industry's reliance on physical testing, which can increase design time and product development costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Project relies on an innovative relationship between the multi-scale hardness properties of a material and its long-term fatigue performance. By measuring the hardness of material, the technology can predict long-term product life. Currently, durability simulations are performed utilizing finite element analysis simulations and experimentally obtained material fatigue properties, neglecting important processing properties such as hardness and roughness. As a result, such simulations are often not accurate enough to predict the long-term performance of a product and thus necessitating physical testing for verification. The inclusion of processing parameters obtained through hardness testing in such simulation allows the designer to take into account many other contributing material factors and create a more robust and comprehensive simulation. This more accurate prediction of long-term product performance can drastically reduce the amount of physical testing necessary to verify a product is ready for the market. Using the multi-scale material properties from the hardness test, the proposed web-based software solution will be able to assist product engineers in design decisions regarding long term performance in any new or modified part."

Initially the technology is expected to enhance the performance of thermal management products in electronics through the implementation of nanocarbon foams. Thermal management is critically important to many electronics and energy applications because ever-increasing generation of heat has become an impediment to the advancement and efficient operation of those devices. Thermal management devices made from nanocarbon foams could ensure enhanced performance of electronic devices by efficiently dissipating the high heat fluxes present in these devices. The lightweight, super-elastic, and high stability properties of nanocarbon foams make them a unique alternative for the thermal management of portable and flexible electronic devices.  In addition to thermal management, other applications of nanocarbon foams include use in electrodes for advanced batteries, in fuel cells, in pressure sensors, and in scaffolds for medical treatments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on potential applications of nanocarbon foams for thermal management. Nanocarbon foam is a carbon nanotube based all carbon porous material. It consists of large numbers of micro-scale cells and sub-micro thick walls with nano-scale pores. Because of their unique structures, the nanocarbon foams show high capillary pressure, super-absorption, large working fluid storage, and fast fluid transfer capabilities. They are also conductive, lightweight, stable, and flexible. These features allow nanocarbon foams to be a novel wick material for thermal management products and have a better performance than current wick materials. The simple and scalable fabrication process could lead to low cost and high quality device manufacturing.

This research will result in (1) novel cross-layer design techniques that take a holistic approach of simultaneously reducing power consumption, while still achieving reliability and performance goals for NoCs, (2) a fundamental understanding of the use of hardware-amenable ML for NoC design optimization, (3) software and hardware techniques for monitoring and collecting critical data and key design parameters during network execution to optimize NoC design, and (4) modeling and simulation tools that will improve the architecture community?s design methodologies for evaluating scalable NoCs. The proposed research bridges a very important gap between hardware architects who design power management and fault tolerant techniques at the circuit and architecture level and machine learning scientists who develop predictive and optimization techniques. Due to its cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential to significantly transform the design of next-generation CMPs and System-on-Chips (SoCs) where complex decisions have to be made that affect the power, performance and reliability.

Manihiki and Rakahanga, two remote and resource-poor atolls in the South Pacific Ocean, provide a unique small-scale setting to investigate the ways that human populations transformed and managed marginal environments to create long-term sustainability. The research team will use archaeological methods to investigate the processes of social and environmental transformation that sustained the people of Manihiki and Rakahanga for nearly 1,000 years, while investigating the role that the northern Cook Islands played in the colonization of East Polynesia. By training local assistants in archaeological methods, principles of site preservation, and highly applicable technical skills, this project will also provide local education opportunities, while encouraging the protection of local cultural resources. The completion of this research will result in a time line for human/environmental interaction on the atolls that stretches from island formation, during late-Holocene sea level fall, through to the historic period (roughly 1849 AD). The perspectives of historical ecology and resilience theory will be used to contextualize and explain how the long-term habitation of these atolls was accomplished. Combined, these efforts will facilitate a deep-time understanding of the ways that humans construct landscapes and develop conservation/ management practices that can sustain populations in even the most marginal environments. The results of this research will be shared through presentations and publications aimed at academic audiences, as well as local Cook Islands populations to inform and inspire conversations about local and global challenges regarding landscape management. <br/><br/>This research draws from multiple socioecological perspectives. Historical ecology, is a research perspective that accepts the challenges of environmental conditions, while recognizing that humans can manipulate landscapes to create long-term trajectories of continuity and change. Resilience theory offers a complimentary viewpoint that contextualizes the processes that shape landscapes in terms of key social and ecological variables. Combined these frameworks will be used to address the following question: Through what processes and over what time scales have humans transformed and managed marginal or emerging environments to create resilient cultural landscapes? The research team will use archaeological field methods, including the excavation of habitation and resource procurement areas on Manihiki and Rakahanga to identify changing settlement patterns and physical landform alterations (i.e., the construction of horticultural fields). Laboratory analysis of the excavated materials will include zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remains to trace changes in local ecologies and resource use, foraminifera analysis to identify markers of atoll formation, and an extensive AMS radiocarbon dating program to define time spans for events in the landscape trajectories of the atolls. Combined these methods will answer this research question by revealing the long-term patterns of settlement, resource use, and landscape alteration that shaped long-term sustainability on these marginal atolls."

The PI will therefore investigate computationally efficient methods for learning from data with minimal assumptions about its regularity. Though statistical machines are often designed for specific forms of theoretical regularity, theoretical assumptions are often violated in practice. In particular, it may not be known how representative of the future data is. For example, macroeconomic data is highly irregular yet is typically modeled as if it were.  Fortunately, when learning from highly irregular data is not much harder than learning from regular data, methods optimal for irregular data will automatically be competitive with (if not vastly superior to) methods designed specifically for regular data, even when the data happens to be regular. Designing learners for irregular data is therefore a statistically sound and flexible approach, but one which requires computational advances, as is to be addressed by the proposed work. This research is part of an international collaboration with Dr. Jian Li at Tsinghua University, China. <br/><br/>The proposed work relies on methods from online regret-based learning, namely expert ensembles. In the experts setting, learning takes the form of doing almost as well as the best expert in hindsight, and is accomplished by mixing the experts' advice. The PI proposes to attain computational efficiency by limiting the feedback from the ensemble, via sampling a subset of experts every period of time. In that way, per period, less resources are spent on computing expert advice and less read and writes on updating expert weights; and the storage required for expert weights grows more slowly over time. In particular, limiting feedback to one expert per period corresponds to the bandits setting from the literature.<br/><br/>The East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program award supports summer U.S. graduate student research, and is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Current biomedical and life sciences have benefited from the applications of optogenetic tools such as sensing analytes in the body (in vivo) like calcium, controlling ion channels for communication, and genome editing in hopes of curing genetic diseases. Optogenetic applications are currently limited by the specificity or accuracy in binding targeted molecules and the rate it takes to turn the tool on and off. Dr. Moritoshi Sato is one of the leading professors working on optogenetics at the University of Tokyo. Under the guidance of Dr. Sato and his team, the Fellow will receive hands-on experience in developing new photoswitches for optogenetic control along with making published photoswitches. <br/><br/>Photoswitching proteins, naturally found in plants, fungi, and bacteria, have allowed protein engineers to take advantage of the optogenetic methods. Natural photoswitches are known to homodimerize and exhibit slow switch-off kinetics which decrease the efficiency of optical control and limit their applications in optogenetics. Dr. Moritoshi Sato at the University of Tokyo has created novel photoswitches named Magnets that were derived from a photoreceptor named Vivid. By engineering the cofactor-binding domain, the Sato lab was able to selectively induce fast heterodimerization and tune the switch-off kinetics from hours to seconds. These Magnets were implemented into a genome editing protein named CRISPR-Cas9 which was originally developed to be controlled chemically. The incorporation of Magnets led to a photoactivatable Cas9 (paCas9) which enables optogenetic control. The overarching goal of this project is to synthesize photoswitches (Vivid, Magnet variants, and paCas9) using Dr. Sato's protein engineering facility so the samples can be later analyzed using the ultrafast laser spectroscopy facility at Oregon State University. We will exploit the wavelength-tunable femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) technique to track the photocatalytic reaction pathways around the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore in different Vivid mutants including the slow and fast Magnets. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of how the current mutations within the Vivid cofactor-binding domain give rise to specific changes in the protein function, aided by the sulfur-containing amino acid residues in the vicinity of FAD. As a result, structural dynamics basis for the Magnet light sensing efficiency, dimerization, and switch-on and off kinetics can be elucidated. The optimization of optogenetic tools will allow for advanced applications in neuron modulation, drug delivery, bioimaging, and biosensors. The integration of bioengineering and biophysics enables a bottom-up approach to fundamentally understand photochemistry at the chemical bond level for photoswitchable proteins, and to rationally design and effectively achieve the desired protein functionality.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Glycans (or polysaccharides) are complex biomolecules that play important roles in the biochemistry of living systems, despite their low abundance.  Their qualitative and quantitative analysis can be important in identifying and distinguishing healthy and diseased cells.  Dr. Gao's group is targeting new ways to derive glycan structural information using mass spectrometry, one of the most widely used and important tools of chemical analysis.  They are devising ways to label glycan molecules with isotopic or other chemical ""tags"" to gain better insight into their fragmentation and to facilitate their quantitation.  The work seeks both improved performance and better understanding of the methods.  Impact on workforce development is enhanced by involvement of undergraduate students, including first-generation college students and members from under-represented groups; Montclair State University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Elements of the research are integrated into Dr. Gao's undergraduate courses, enabling students to become familiar with modern analytical techniques. <br/><br/>The overarching goals of the research are to develop a novel free-radical approach for glycan characterization and quantitation, and to investigate glycan dissociation induced by free radicals. Combining the merits of free-radical chemistry and mass spectrometry requires 1) development of free-radical reagents for glycan characterization; 2) development of free-radical tags for glycan quantitation; and 3) synthesis of model glycans for investigation of glycan dissociation mechanisms. These tasks provide a range of synthesis opportunities for the students engaged in the research.  The free-radical reagents are employed to generate systematic and predictable glycan dissociation, facilitating visualization of the glycan skeleton. Free-radical tags enable simultaneous glycan quantitation and characterization. Insights gained from the investigation of glycan dissociation should improve understanding of the potential broader utility of the free-radical dissociation approach. The work should advance understanding of the roles of glycans in health and disease, including tumor development and other glycosylation-related diseases, such as coronary heart disease and inflammatory bowel disease."

However, even the strongest of relationships can come under duress in the event that one partner harms or offends the other. Rather than abandoning these relationships, people frequently respond by forgiving. Because forgiveness is crucial in maintaining valuable cooperative relationships, researchers have suggested that humans possess evolved psychological mechanisms designed for achieving forgiveness. These mechanisms utilize two criteria in determining whether an individual will forgive or abandon a relationship: the value of the relationship, and the likelihood that the offender will exploit them again. The purpose of this project is to investigate the operation of these forgiveness mechanisms across diverse cultural landscapes, as cultures vary in terms of the social opportunities they offer, consequently impacting relationship value. Cultures that offer few opportunities for new relationship partners commensurately raise the value of existing relationships, making people more willing to forgive; when new relationships are scarce, there is external incentive to give someone another chance. In contrast, in cultures where new relationships are plentiful, individuals may be less motivated to tolerate a harmful partner. This project will be conducted at Kobe University in Japan in collaboration with Dr. Yohsuke Ohtsubo, an expert in forgiveness research. <br/><br/>Japan is the ideal place to study this phenomenon, fostering a society where new social relationships are difficult to find, making it an optimal foil to the United States, a society that affords the opportunity to form many new social relationships. This project aims to explain cross-cultural variation in forgiveness using a socio-ecological perspective, emphasizing that behavior and psychology are often the product of game theoretic strategies that individuals adopt in response to local environmental conditions. In addition, this project furthers research on the evolved design of psychological mechanisms undergirding forgiveness and cooperation.<br/><br/>This award ,under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

The project team will iteratively refine existing, computer-based pedagogical materials based on an analysis of log data of hundreds of students who have used those materials to learn. The work will be done with middle school mathematics students, specifically sixth grade students, and the target topic will be decimals. Recent research and studies have indicated that learning from the errors of others -- a prominent pedagogical approach used in medical education, but less commonly used in other areas of education -- has considerable potential to help students learn. Yet, erroneous examples are not used widely, in part because it is not yet understood how and why they provide this benefit. The broader impact of the project is that it will provide improved mathematics lessons, infused with erroneous examples, vetted with empirical evidence of their effectiveness, which can be deployed on the world-wide web to the significant number of U.S. students who are at risk of poor mathematics achievement due to poor understanding of core STEM concepts. The project will also provide a blueprint that can be used widely in other projects and systems, supported by both theory and empirical evidence, for how to help students learn from erroneous examples. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The project will employ an iterative research plan in which log data from online learning of erroneous examples will be datamined and analyzed. The project team will start with log data from over 600 middle school mathematics students who have used erroneous examples to learn in online instructional technology and games. The team will then collect data from approximately two thousand more students over the course of the three-year project to explore whether enhancements to the erroneous examples materials based on revised theory improves student learning. Moment-by-moment learning models will be used to understand whether students learn immediately from erroneous examples, or whether erroneous examples lead to future learning. The project team will also study whether confusion and other forms of affect mediate successful learning from erroneous examples, using previously validated automated detectors of confusion and other affective states. The project team will also investigate how each of the steps of the student interaction with the erroneous examples -- for example, identifying errors, fixing errors, and explaining errors -- promote learning and positive affect. By the end of the third year of the project, the project team anticipates having a comprehensive theoretical model of how learning with erroneous examples works and how erroneous examples should be integrated into instruction more generally."

Educational researchers have found that calculus presents a significant hurdle for these students. To help counter this, over the past few decades, instructors have become increasingly willing to experiment with innovative teaching formats, such as providing students with instructional videos outside of class to promote a more active and engaging learning environment. Despite this increasing popularity, relatively little is known about how students watch and learn from these instructional videos. To help instructors design videos to better promote student learning of mathematics, this project will collect data about how students use, engage with, and learn from calculus videos. Furthermore, this project will investigate the impact that various ways of structuring the video-watching experience has on student learning. In doing so, this project will generate new knowledge about the effectiveness of various implementation methods for instructional videos in supporting students' productive ways of understanding foundational calculus concepts and real-world applications.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the understanding of how students make sense of and learn calculus from supplementary instructional videos. Project team members will adapt ideas from the fields of information systems and organizational studies to investigate: (1) the ways students interact with video lectures, including how they pause, skip, and re-watch portions of the videos; (2) the aspects of the videos students attend to - and report attending to - as they watch; (3) the ways students make sense of and learn from these videos, and how this relates the other aspects described above; and (4) how various ways of structuring the video-watching experience, such as providing an outline or pre-watching questions, can influence each of these aspects. Data will be obtained from multiple sources, including student responses to mathematical content questions before and after watching videos, timestamps of students' interactions with videos (i.e., playing, pausing, and time-shifting videos), student responses to interview questions as they watch videos, and eye-tracking data collected as students watch videos. The mixed-methods analysis will yield knowledge about the ways students interact with and learn from instructional videos. This investigation into various methods of structuring the video-watching experience will contribute to the field's understanding of how to create and use videos as effective curricular resources and learning tools. In addition, the project will produce research-based guidelines for creating and effectively using instructional calculus videos. By achieving these goals, the research project has the potential to improve the quality of STEM education and, ultimately, contribute to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce."

The way that human disturbance and habitat loss affect animal movement across the landscape and connect separate populations is difficult to understand, however. In order to investigate this topic, the project will use genetic analysis to measure population connectivity of giant pandas across several nature reserves and unprotected areas facing varying levels of human disturbance as a case study. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jindong Zhang of China West Normal University, an expert in giant panda ecology. This will be done by collecting panda fecal samples across the study area and extracting DNA from the outer layer of each pellet. The genetic distance between panda individuals across the region will be analyzed and compared with landscape features to find out which ones enhance and which ones impede giant panda movement and gene flow. For example, a road or village will likely be much more difficult to move through than a forest. The project will also examine the amount of habitat that is needed to keep populations connected across a landscape. Results will inform management of not only giant pandas, but other habitat specialist species facing habitat fragmentation and human disturbance pressures. <br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, resulting from natural and anthropogenic disturbances, is a complex pressure for wildlife that can affect species differently. The giant panda is a species that faces extensive fragmentation throughout its range, and is an ideal habitat-specialist to study its effects due to a reliance on understory bamboo habitat. This project will use giant pandas as a case study to investigate the effects of natural and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on the connectivity of wildlife populations. Non-invasive genetics sampling of fecal deposits across a nature reserve network will be collected to compare the genetic distance between panda individuals with different measures of environmental distance. Analyses of the covariance of these matrixes will determine the major barriers and areas of resistance to gene flow and population connectivity throughout the region.

This has occurred, in part, because Presidents, Senators, and policy groups have increasingly prioritized ideological compatibility and reliability in the appointment process. This project will document the degree of polarization over several Court eras, highlighting periods of low to high polarization. Because the Court has become increasingly divided as it decides some of the most important issues in American politics, each vacancy represents an opportunity to shape the long-term direction of the Court?s decision making. The project seeks to explain how and why polarization matters for the Court?s role in American government. <br/><br/>The project consists of five components. First, the study will include extensive data and statistical analyses of the changing levels of Court polarization since 1946, measuring justices? ?swing capacities? to determine how many justices in a given period were swing justices vis--vis reliable ideologues. Second, the project will include statistical analyses of how polarization has influenced the direction of the Court?s decision making, while testing whether the existence of at least one swing justice sustains fairly moderate policy outputs over time. Third, by analyzing Supreme Court voting data, the project aims to explain a ?polarization paradox?: As Court polarization has increased over time, both the rates of closely-divided (5-4) case outcomes and of unanimous decisions have escalated. Fourth, by engaging in content-analyzes of media coverage of the Court?s rulings over time, the study will analyze whether the media report on the Court in more political and less legalistic terms in polarized eras relative to less polarized eras. Finally, the project will examine how polarization influences the legitimacy and authority of the Court as the final arbiter of constitutional meaning in American politics. Using an experimental approach, this project will test whether a polarized Supreme Court elicits lower levels of legitimacy from the mass public than a less polarized Court."

After a half-century of research on the human impacts of disasters, anthropologists know that it is necessary to take local cultures into account to reduce post-disaster suffering and speed recovery for disaster-affected communities. However, these well-documented findings are almost never implemented in disaster planning. Therefore, this workshop convenes a group of anthropologists and anthropology-minded practitioners to communicate anthropological disaster science findings directly to international policy makers concerned with disaster response and recovery. At the same time, by investigating the contexts of disaster policy-making itself, the workshop provides the anthropologists an opportunity to learn from the policy makers why local culture is consistently omitted from disaster planning. <br/><br/>Convened by the American Anthropological Association, the workshop brings together for the first-time practitioners, researchers, and academics whose work spans the fields of cultural anthropology, risk perception and communication, disaster risk reduction, recovery management, post-disaster needs assessment, reconstruction, and resettlement. Drawing on extensive fieldwork to theorize the persistent issues surrounding the role of culture in disaster policy and practice, workshop participants will share: (a) lessons learned from past disaster cases; (b) knowledge about best practices; and (c) action steps to advance the recognition and inclusion of cultural priorities and values among groups vulnerable to or impacted by disaster. These action steps will include strategies for how to adaptive capacity in contexts of disaster risk reduction and recovery planning. Additionally, the team will conduct a rapid ethnography of the UN Global Platform and the reactions to anthropological theory and application and work collaboratively to conduct a thematic analysis of documents and public statements produced as part of the Global Platform. Outcomes of will include: a roundtable presentation at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association; publication of a report in Anthropology News and in Natural Hazards Observer that identifies key themes and opportunities that emerge from the workshop; a paper that summarizes key themes of disaster anthropology and the implementation of cultural competency, and which critically assesses their potentiality within other disaster and risk reduction policy arenas; and the development of a policy brief outlining the role of cultural competency in risk reduction and disaster response."

Existing studies have shown that interfacial perturbations can propagate anywhere from a few nanometers to tens and even hundreds of nanometers from the interface depending on the material property in question, with glassy materials appearing to be particularly sensitive to interfacial perturbations.  This research aims to build on our understanding of how the local properties of polymer materials change as a function of distance from a given interface to try to address why interfaces between two dissimilar polymers show dynamical gradients that can span hundreds of nanometers and are unexpectedly asymmetric with respect to the composition profile.  Experiments will focus on testing the underlying causes for this unexpected behavior by measuring detailed dynamical profiles of local glass transition temperature as a function of depth near various interfaces via fluorescence that can be used to test current theoretical efforts in the field, as well as assessing such long range behavior with other experimental techniques.  Direct comparisons will be made between several different systems designed to separate, isolate, and test several factors that may make such polymer-polymer interfaces unique:  molecular chain connectivity across the interface, breadth of interface, interfacial roughness, modulus, domain size and cooling rate.  Such efforts should be able to deconvolve various factors believed to be responsible for how interfaces alter local material properties and dynamics."

For the sake of maintaining safe, healthy communities, it is crucial that scientists work to understand the biological underpinnings of aggressive behavior. This award supports the researcher as she investigates this topic by traveling to Inuyama, Japan, where she will work under the advisement of Dr. Yukiori Goto at the Primate Research Institute (PRI). In particular, this project will examine the relationship between the MAOA gene and levels of aggression in two macaque species. The PRI offers a unique opportunity to study primate behavior and genetics simultaneously, and the results will contribute to our understanding of how genes contribute to levels of aggression. In the future, this research may aid in the development of pharmaceutical therapies for antisocial personality disorders in humans. <br/><br/>Research on the genetic basis of aggressive behavior has focused on the MAOA gene, though its role in behavior modulation is not fully understood. The MAOA gene codes for the enzyme monoamine oxidase-A and it functions in the brain to degrade the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. In humans and nonhuman primates, two variants of the MAOA gene have been documented, a high-activity variant (MAOA-H) and a low-activity variant (MAOA-L). Past studies have found the low-activity variant to be associated with elevated levels of aggression, presumably due to higher levels of circulating neurotransmitters. This project will focus on differential levels of aggression and its relationship to particular MAOA gene variants in rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese (Macaca fuscata) macaques. The research will consist of three components: I.) collection and analysis of behavioral data as it relates to aggressive behavior within and between species, II.) determination of MAOA genotype for all individuals involved in the behavioral studies, and III.) examination of the data for associations between gene variants and levels of aggression that may explain inter-individual levels of aggression as well as species-specific patterns.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Asian Longhorned Beetle is one of the most costly invasive insects in the United States. Citrus Longhorned Beetle, due to its invasive presence in Europe, its similar biology, and broader host range, is one of the most threatening potential invasives. In addition to identifying compounds for much-needed attractive lures, this project will also explore host detection by two closely related insects with broad, overlapping host ranges. Currently, evidence supports the hypothesis that instead of detecting single, unique compounds, insects detect their hosts by sensing host characteristic mixtures of common compounds. It follows from this hypothesis that there is a mixture of compounds unique to Asian Longhorned Beetle hosts and a different mixture of compounds unique to Citrus Longhorned Beetle hosts. However, the wide range of hardwoods infested by both species makes these mixtures difficult to identify. In order to overcome this difficulty, leaf scent samples will be collected from a variety of host and non-host hardwood trees. The host characteristic mixture will then be derived by statistically comparing host and non-host samples. As Citrus Longhorned Beetle is not available to this researcher in the United States and work with Asian Longhorned Beetle is highly regulated, this project will be completed in the beetles native range at Nanjing Forestry University, China, in collaboration with Dr. Hao DeJun, an international longhorned beetle expert.<br/>	Insects are hypothesized to orient towards their hosts by detecting ubiquitously produced volatiles in a host characteristic ratio. This project will take advantage of this principle in order to identify the host percepts of Asian Longhorned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) and Citrus Longhorned Beetle (Anoplophora chinensis), two sympatric wood-boring pests with overlapping host ranges. Volatiles released by a variety of host and non-host hardwood species will be collected by head-space aerations with Porapak adsorbant traps. Antennally-active volatiles indicated by GC-EAD will then be identified and quantified using GC-MS. Host percept mixtures will be identified through a discriminate analysis of antennally-active volatile quantities with host and non-host groups. Finally, positive chemotaxis towards these mixtures will be verified using laboratory y-tube bioassays and field trapping.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Stony corals that build reefs are comprised of the cnidarian host, symbiotic algae and additional bacteria, fungi and viruses that are collectively termed the ""coral holobiont"". Disruptions that affect the healthy holobiont, such as high temperature stress due to climate change, are hypothesized to increase the incidence of coral bleaching and disease via immune suppression of the coral host. However, coral innate immunity research has been limited, and there is a poor understanding of in vivo host-microbe regulatory mechanisms. Nanwan Bay in southern Taiwan has unique oceanographic and bathymetric features that cause deepwater upwelling during spring tides, leading to temperature fluctuations as great as 10C over the course of a few hours. This highly variable temperature regime experienced by corals on reefs near upwelling regions in Nanwan Bay may contribute to increased resilience to thermal stress, although the physiological basis for enhanced tolerance is undetermined. <br/><br/>During this EAPSI fellowship, recirculating aquarium experiments will use antibiotics, heat stress and immune stimulation to perturb the holobiont of the model coral species Pocillopora damicornis before gene expression, protein expression, and flow cytometry analyses are applied to assess the capacity for coral immune adaptation in variable temperature settings. The primary hypothesis is that temperature fluctuations caused by tidal upwelling in Nanwan Bay select for Pocillopora corals with a broader immune capacity to modulate microbial community shifts due to temperature variability.

Anammox bacteria play an important role in removing reactive nitrogen (i.e., nitrogen species that directly or indirectly support growth) from both natural and engineered ecosystems, but their role in removing reactive nitrogen from geothermal hot spring ecosystems is not well understood. Increased knowledge of anammox bacteria is particularly valuable today, because most of the world's industrialized nations are struggling to manage elevated concentrations of reactive nitrogen in their fresh and marine water bodies. The insights into the distribution and diversity of anammox bacteria gained as a result of this project will help scientists and engineers develop and apply more robust and sustainable reactive nitrogen removal processes.

Further analyses will be performed on these samples to elucidate the abundance and functional capabilities of anammox bacteria within these samples. Abundance will be determined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, and functional capabilities will be determined through metagenomic analyses. Subsequently, these same analyses will be performed on samples extracted from geothermal hot spring enrichment bioreactors operated by the Zhuang Laboratory, in order to understand the impacts of the translation of extremophilic anammox bacteria from a natural ecosystem to an engineered bioreactor.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

The ICCMR-13 will cover the major current research topics in the field of membrane reactors with participants from around the world. The continued development and implementation of membrane reactors has significant societal, economic and environmental impacts. For example, electrochemical membranes (fuel cells) promise direct conversion of hydrocarbon fuels from multiple renewable sources (e.g., biomass) or net-zero carbon fuel cycles (e.g., those based upon ammonia, methanol) thus avoiding the Carnot-cycle limit on thermal efficiency inherent to combustion-based power systems. Hydrogen and/or oxygen-permeable membranes promise the ability to efficiently manipulate a broad range of industrial chemistries in order to minimize waste and associated energy costs related to product separation and recycle. Biological and enzymatic membranes, alongside more conventional catalytic membrane reactors, provide low-energy pathways to water purification. This is the first time that this biennial international conference will be held in the United States, thus providing a uniquely valuable opportunity for US researchers, students and young investigators to engage with the international catalytic membrane community. It is anticipated that approximately 30 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.<br/><br/>The main topics of the ICCMR-13 include: Modeling of Membrane Reactors and Processes,  Biochemical & Enzymatic Membrane Reactors, Inorganic (Metal-Organic Framework, Zeolitic) Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Environmental Application of Membrane Reactors, Sustainable Energy Application of Membrane Reactors, Proton-conducting Ceramic Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Oxygen-conducting Ceramic Membranes and Membrane Reactors, Hydrogen Generation in Membrane Reactors, Fabrication and Characterization of Palladium Membranes for Reactor Applications, Palladium Membrane Reactors, Demonstrations and Applications. Over the past two decades, the ICCMR-13 Conference has served as the driving force behind the membrane reactor community for advancing such technologies. Anticipated outcomes of the Conference are the presentation of 50 oral and at least 20 poster papers, in addition to invited plenary presentations. The PI has secured agreements with Elsevier to generate special issues of Catalysis Today, and International Journal of Hydrogen Energy resulting from papers presented at ICCMR-13. The Conference organizers plan to aggressively pursue attendance of US-based researchers, with particular emphasis upon enhancing attendance by members of underrepresented groups, through financial assistance."

Neutrinos, or geoneutrinos when from the Earth, are incredibly small, chargeless particles emitted from natural radioactivity within rocks. These particles have a very small chance of hitting anything, and can thus travel easily from anywhere inside the Earth to the surface. Counting the number of geoneutrinos passing through the KamLAND detector allows us to know the supply of radioactivity within the Earth, even though we cannot access rocks from the deep Earth.  This project aims to investigate the rocks closest to the detector, as the geoneutrinos emitted by these rocks have a larger effect on the measured signal vs those farther away.  The estimated signal from Japanese rocks in this study will be subtracted from the measurement by KamLAND, leaving only the signal from the inaccessible deep Earth.  The final signal is indicative of the amount of radioactivity within the Earth.  This work is being conducted in conjunction with Professor Kunio Inoue at Tohoku University, who is the Director of the Research Center of Neutrino Sciences at Tohoku University and principal investigator of KamLAND.<br/><br/>The radiogenic power of the Earth is not well constrained, with estimates ranging from low (10 TW) to high (30 TW) heat production.  Measurement of the flux of geoneutrinos from the Earth thus acts as a proxy for the heat production within the Earth.  KamLAND (Japan) and Borexino (Italy) are the only two operating detectors. Determining the mantle signal, an important objective, requires subtraction of the crustal flux from the measured flux at these detectors.  Unfortunately, discrepancy exists between model estimates of the crustal flux at KamLAND. This project will create a high-resolution, 3D model of the nearest 300 km of crust surrounding KamLAND (est. ~ 50% of total signal). All available geochemical (U and Th) and geophysical (seismic, cross-sections, borehole, heat flow, and gravity) data will be integrated into a single coherent and self-consistent model. Consolidation of units defined on a geologic map of Japan will provide simplified reservoirs, which can be defined 3-dimensionally by the assembled geophysical data in Central Japan.  To these reservoirs we will characterized the U and Th concentrations, and their uncertainties, from the assembled geochemical data. This 3D model, with defined physical structure and radioactive element concentration, will be used to calculate a new near-field, crustal geoneutrino signal at KamLAND.   <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

A covert channel is any mechanism through which two parties simultaneously accessing the same computer intentionally communicate, despite this mechanism being disallowed for communication.  Examples of both channels abound, and their presence makes our computation and communication infrastructure less secure: side channels allow attackers to glean sensitive information that they would not otherwise be able to access, and covert channels enable unauthorized disclosure between users. <br/><br/>This project enables engineers to attenuate side- and convert channels, thereby making our electronic infrastructure less vulnerable to external attack and internal leaks. In the process, the project enables a new collaboration between researchers in information theory, computer architecture, and communication networks. The project broadens participation of under-represented groups, especially women, through research opportunities and an improved mentoring program for a professional society.<br/><br/>This project approaches the study of side- and covert channels information theoretically.  Historically, information theory has provided relatively little assistance toward mitigating side- and covert channels. This is partly because it is unclear how to quantify the amount of information leaked through a side channel and partly because many side- and covert channels involve a receiver that can actively control the channel. Such receivers are not well understood.<br/><br/>To address these two impediments, the project develops a recently-proposed metric for measuring leakage in side-channels that is operationally justified and easily computed. The project also develops results that enable one to predict how active receivers will act. The project culminates in the application of these results to three specific scenarios spanning communication networks and multi-core processors."

It is a challenge problem to realistically represent/simulate clouds and cloud-aerosol interactions in global models of the Earth's climate system because they are very complex and usually much smaller than the typical tens of kilometer sized grid cells in current global models.  In order to limit computing costs, the present Community Earth System Model (CESM), which is one of the nation's leading global models, uses a minimalist representation of clouds by computing only their mean particle size and their condensed water mass.  These simplifications lead to a vast expansion of tuning parameters whose values are not well defined.  As a result, the current CESM cloud model predicts liquid cloud particle sizes that differ greatly from those observed by satellite.  The work replaces the CESM liquid cloud model with one that fully tracks the range of particles sizes in the clouds.  With full knowledge of the particle sizes much more complete and realistic cloud physics will be implemented in the model, and the number of tunable, poorly defined parameters will be reduced.  The new model will also be used to improve the parameterization of physical mechanisms.  Another goal of the  work is to link aerosols to the ice cloud model, and apply the ice cloud model to determine the role of new ice particle formation, particularly involving organic aerosols, in controlling cloud properties.  By utilizing the size resolved liquid and ice models, the study will evaluate the aerosol-cloud climate forcing, one of the most uncertain factors in climate modeling.<br/><br/>Cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions are among the greatest uncertainties in climate modeling.  By improving the physics used to simulate clouds and their interactions with aerosols the uncertainties may be reduced.  This project will improve representations of both ice and liquid clouds in CESM, test these changes against data mainly from satellites, and apply the models to well-defined, testable projects involving cloud-aerosol interactions.  This project will integrate research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning; broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the Physical Sciences by involving female graduate students; enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by further developing the CESM model; and, provide benefits to society by reducing uncertainty in aerosol radiative climate forcing resulting from a better representation of interactions between clouds and aerosols as well as by improving national tools to address such issues."

This study will create tasks specifically designed to generate opportunities for teachers to build on students' thinking and then use classroom observation and analysis of classroom video to develop tools to support teachers in leading whole class discussion. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the teaching practice of building on student thinking, a practice in which teachers engage students in making sense of their peers? mathematical ideas in ways that help the whole class move forward in their mathematical understanding. This study examines how teachers incorporate this practice into mathematics discussions in secondary classrooms by designing tasks that generate opportunities for teachers to build on students' thinking and by studying teachers? orchestration of whole class discussions around student responses to these tasks. The project engages teacher-researchers in exploring the building practice. The teacher-researchers will use the project-designed tasks in their classrooms and then engage in a cycle of analysis of their own teaching with the research team. Data collection and analysis will rely on video analysis of classrooms, teachers? reflections on task enactment, and data collected during research team meetings convened with teacher-researchers to analyze practice."

Even a fractional reduction in cleanup time can drastically reduce economic opportunity costs and low social morale while more quickly returning these communities to pre-disaster quality of life. One possibility for reducing cleanup time is the deployment of humanoid robots. In the 2015 DARPA challenge, teams from around the world demonstrated that humanoid robots have the ability to navigate and interact with their world with unprecedented complexity: driving, using tools, opening doors, and manipulating facility controls. The biggest obstacle to overcome before humanoids can be deployed for cleanup is developing better material-handling capabilities like lifting, pushing, pulling, and stacking. As roboticists develop these capabilities, their humanoid robots are evolving different software and sensor approaches. This project will compare the software and sensors of an American and a Korean humanoid being developed for disaster cleanup, identify disparities in configuration, and determine optimum configuration for material-handling missions. The project will be conducted at Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology under the mentorship of Dr. Jun Ho Oh, whose team placed first in the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge.<br/><br/>The humanoids being compared in this study are DRC Hubo 2 platforms. The American and Korean Hubos use many of the same scripts and hardware, but differences have evolved as both groups continue to develop the platform independently. In cases that these differences significantly affect performance, the researcher will use a combination of simulated and real material-handling trials to determine which software and sensor approach produces superior success rates and completion times.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

A byproduct of energy production is reactive oxygen species (ROS), molecules capable of damaging organelles and leading to further release of ROS. Therefore, cells must maintain a population of healthy, functioning mitochondria. The maintenance mechanisms that have been identified include the recycling of mitochondria and the ongoing division and joining together of mitochondria. While these mechanisms have been well studied in numerous types of cells, they remain poorly understood in neurons, a type of cell of the nervous system. Neurons transmit signals to and from the central nervous system, requiring high amounts of energy, especially at synapses, sites distant from the cell body where there would also be a greater need to remove damaged mitochondria.  In collaboration with Professor Michael Ryan at Monash University, an expert in mitochondrial fission and fusion, this project will investigate functional interactions of mitochondria with cellular components in locations of the cell with high metabolic activity.<br/><br/>The study of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms in neurons has focused on their occurrence in the cell body, while little is known about how damaged mitochondria are removed from axons and presynaptic terminals. In addition to fission/fusion events and mitophagy, the selective autophagy of mitochondria, trafficking of mitochondria along microtubules may act to replace damaged organelles with healthy ones from the cell body. To study which of these mechanisms are activated in response to oxidative stress, a photoactivatable ROS-producing peptide targeted to mitochondria will be introduced into live cells in which our proteins of interest have been labeled with fluorescent dyes. Using confocal live imaging and super-resolution microscopy, snapshots of presynaptic mitochondria exposed to or unexposed to green light will be generated and compared to assess which factors are involved in the removal of damaged mitochondria.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

For example, the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics (which have numerous applications ranging from star formation to aircraft design) are in the form of a system of hyperbolic PDEs expressing physical conservation laws. Solutions of compressible Euler equations often develop discontinuities, which are known as shock waves; the latter are manifested as a sonic boom when an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. In general, solutions of quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs can develop finite-time singularities. In this research, the investigator focuses on the compressible Euler equations and the nonlinear wave equations whose solutions form shock waves and cusp singularities (such as those that occur in liquid crystal equations) in finite time. The project uses both analytical and numerical techniques to enhance basic understanding of these equations. This research on singular behavior of waves is expected to lead to better understanding of fundamental features of hyperbolic PDEs. <br/> <br/>This research project seeks to deepen understanding of the structure of solutions with large data including shock waves. The issues of the variation of solutions and their propagation, the generic regularity of solutions, and understanding of behavior of solution near vacuum will be investigated. The second part of the project focuses on the quasi-linear wave system modeling nematic liquid crystals, where the solution develops a cusp singularity. The research contains a number of new approaches. In the study of Lipschitz continuous dependence, a Finsler type optimal transport metric will be utilized, since the standard Sobolev norms do not yield useful information. To study the generic regularity, the Thom transversality theorem will be used."

Part of this preparation involves developing a strong foundation for algebra in the elementary grades by building on students' informal intuitions about patterns, relationships and structure into more formalized ways of mathematical thinking. This project seeks to identify teaching practices that can be linked to students' early algebra learning in grades three, four and five. The goal of the project is to use assessment data and videos of classroom teaching in order to create a tool that can be used to document effective instructional practices. This observation tool can then be used to support teacher professional development in early algebra and research about how teachers' actions can be linked to students' learning. The project is unique in its work to link an early algebra curriculum with understanding of teachers' practices in implementing that curriculum and students' learning of mathematics.

First, what profiles of instructional practice are associated with greater student performance in early algebra? Second, to what extent do these profiles of effective instructional practices vary by grade level? The primary product of the work is an early algebra observation protocol that will capture non-domain and non-grade level specific practices of effective teaching in combination with practices specific to early algebra. Videos of early algebra classrooms will be used to design the observation protocol, which in turn, will then be used along with student assessment data to identify profiles of instructional practices associated with students' learning. Multiple phases of testing and revision will be used to create the observation protocol. The observation protocol will also generate profiles of teacher practices that can be used to describe different models for effectively teaching early algebra. The project will also examine implications of their work for teacher preparation and professional development."

The new instructional sequences will integrate computer science and science learning experiences through simulated internships for core middle school science classrooms, and are designed to increase student dispositions toward, and capacity for, computer programming and computational thinking. Ultimately, the intervention is designed to support broader participation in computer science (CS) fields of study and careers, with particular emphasis on females. This project seeks to accomplish this goal by: (1) immersing up to 4000 11-14 year old youth (Grades 6-8) students in simulated internships that mirror the collaborative and computational work of practicing scientists, and that can be embedded within a school's core science curriculum; (2) offering a more inclusive model of computer science work that can expand students' perception of the nature and value of computer programming and encourage a broader range of students, and females in particular, to identify as possible programmers; (3) gathering evidence that can advance and deepen the field's understanding of how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences; and 4) identifying specific factors, designs, and practices likely to engage students in CS, improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations, and that are likely to improve the capacity of teachers and districts to support CS education. The project extends prior work aimed at incorporating coding and computational thinking into the school in the following ways: an explicit focus on collaborative discourse and collaborative problem solving, including that within digitally-mediated discussion forums; backend data logging of student interactions within the simulated internships' digital environments in order to analyze how student understanding develops at the intersection of science and computer science; just-in-time teacher learning via an educative curriculum to support system capacity and broader impact; and a research and development model that explicitly incorporates school, district, and state policy level stakeholders in the design process, in order to build an understanding of how the intervention, and those like it, can be successfully and sustainably implemented. The project is also supported by the STEM+Computing program (STEM+C) to advance research on how students' computer science knowledge and practices develop within the context of science learning experiences and improve student dispositions toward STEM and CS-related occupations.<br/><br/>The mixed-methods research agenda for this project will be guided by four questions: 1) What specific design features and instructional strategies of the CS Internships are most important for broadening student participation in CS?; 2) What aspects of the CS Internships are most important to support sustainability of CS and science integration?; 3) What factors, design features, and practices are most important for supporting productive student engagement in, and teacher facilitation of, collaboration and discourse (both in-person and digital) in STEM?; and 4) What aspects of student understanding may be revealed when students are able to manipulate the code behind scientific models? In Year 1, the project will pilot and iteratively develop the first of two Coding Science Internships, with methodology grounded in design-based implementation research. Research activities will include observations of piloted lessons and teacher interviews. Also in Year 1, the project will also begin to examine how students develop computational thinking and computer programming practices, through cognitive interviews with students in pilot classrooms. In Year 2, the project will begin broad implementation and systematic investigation of the internship developed in Year 1, and begin iteratively developing the second internship, which will be broadly implemented in Year 3. Research activities related to broad implementation in Years 2 & 3 will include pre-post measures for students (including scales measuring disposition toward CS, and CS and science practices), and teachers (including scales measuring science and technological pedagogical content knowledge and competency beliefs for CS instruction); daily engagement surveys for students; and daily intervention feasibility and perceived value surveys for teachers. In addition to analyses of variance and covariance, the project will employ mediation analysis to examine interactions among key variables contributing to any observed learning gains. Years 2 & 3 will also feature extensive capture of student data generated through interactions with the digital resources (e.g, ""clickstream"" and metadata, submission data and discourse within the digital discussion forums). Learning analytics methods (including machine learning, Bayesian network modeling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation) applied to these massive data sets will be aimed at providing more subtle insight into student development of computational thinking as it applies to science, and possible learning trajectories for the integrated development of computer science and science practices."

Some are highly streamlined and torpedo shaped; others are flattened and tall. It seems likely that some body shapes are better for swimming fast, others might be more maneuverable, and others might be more stable. It has been difficult to make these connections, however, because the internal mechanics of fish bodies also differ. Some are relatively stiff; others are very flexible. In this project, a group of fishes with different body shapes will be studied as they swim in water with eddies or other complex flow patterns. Their body movements and muscle activity will be recorded, which will allow their stability and efficiency to be measured. Then, based on the experiments, a computer model will be developed to simulate both the water movement and the flexible bodies of the fishes. The computer model can describe what might happen if the body shapes or body mechanics change. The model will be released for other researchers to use on similar problems, and the results will help in the design of better underwater vehicles and robots made out of flexible materials. In one educational component, science graduate students will be trained to communicate science better, coordinating with the Tufts STEM ambassadors program to reach out to local middle and high schools. Finally, an interactive museum activity at the Boston Museum of Science will be developed.  The activity will allow museum visitors to design their own flexible fish and race it while measuring its efficiency.<br/><br/>In this project, the connection between swimming performance and body morphology, internal mechanics, and behavior will be investigated in related groups of fishes that differ in overall body shape. The dynamical properties of the body, including stiffness and damping, will be measured, with the muscles passive and active. Based on these measurements, a 3D computational model will be developed to simulate the coupled interaction between the flexible body and the fluid. Then, swimming performance will be measured during swimming in oscillating flow and vortices, in order to estimate the active and passive contributions to stability and energetics for fish swimming in complex flows. This work will use tiny inertial measurement units to measure the body orientation and acceleration of fishes as they swim, which will allow us to estimate measures of stability. These measurements will then be used in computational models, starting with the body properties of one of the fishes and varying it to examine the functional effects of changes in the neural control strategy, body mechanics, and body shape, and how they contribute to swimming performance. The use of computational models to explore the implications of comparative analyses will be a powerful new paradigm, allowing manipulation of individual variables that cannot be done experimentally. These techniques will help reveal how body shape and mechanics contribute to locomotor performance across the diversity in fishes and other animals."

Even if a complete understanding of the object may be out of reach, one can attempt to comprehend its properties ""on average."" In this project, the PI seeks to apply similar principles to the study of geometrically significant groups via their action on naturally associated spaces.

Inspired by the elegant nature of these triangulations, the PI will construct a canonical ideal simplicial complex in the setting of free-by-cyclic groups; a setting where a single topological object controlling the group's algebraic decompositions is currently lacking. Finally, the PI will study the ""typical"" geometry of fibered manifolds, free-by-cyclic groups, and representations of hyperbolic groups.

Because of the extreme meteorological conditions found in Antarctica, direct observations of snowfall and related weather are few, leaving a gap in the regional climate records in the continent. Snow accumulation across the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a critical component for the assessment of the contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise, and accurate measurements are required to evaluate results from regional climate models, used to reconstruct climate trends of the recent past for the whole ice sheet. Owing to the size of Antarctica alone, small fluctuations in the total snow accumulation at the surface have a significant effect on the mass budget of the ice sheet and thus on global sea level. In this work  will develop an instrument suite for deployment at the South Pole research station in Antarctica. The monitoring station will have new state-of-the-art sensors will record measurements of weather, snow accumulation, and structural conditions within the layer of packed snow. The autonomous system will be tested in the coldest and darkest winter on the planet, and will provide the first continuous measurements of snow accumulation processes in the interior of the ice sheet, which will be used to validate atmospheric and regional climate models.  <br/><br/>Technical Description: The overarching goal of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability in ice-sheet surface mass balance and densification rates within the layer of firn, a layer roughly 100 m thick consisting of the buried and compacted snow that has yet to densify into solid ice. For this, we will A) design and install a cost-efficient, reliable, and easily deployable surface mass balance and firn monitoring system for Antarctica; B) adapt the system to operate autonomously for long periods of time under the harshest meteorological conditions; C) use observations for evaluation of surface mass balance simulated by atmospheric reanalyzes and regional climate model; and D) measure the surface mass balance, surface density, and firn compaction rates to derive ice sheet surface elevation change in areas with low ice dynamics. The set up of the monitoring station is unique in that it is able to monitor separately height change due to surface mass balance variability and absolute surface mass balance, the latter in units of water equivalence, and differentiation of the two is crucial for understanding the role of surface processes in ice sheet mass balance. An installed sonic ranger will provide hourly measurements of surface height change that is due to snow accumulation. Surface height change alone is not sufficient to evaluate atmospheric models of surface mass balance, which is measured in in units of mass; a key variable missing is density. To overcome this, the system will be equipped with a SnowFox sensor that is able to capture the variations in surface mass balance in terms of mass through time. Combining the height change with mass change will allow us to determine the density of the material as well, which is very important for conversion of observed height changes due to surface processes into mass changes. Therefore, we aim to better evaluate the short-term variability in surface height and mass fluctuations due to surface mass balance to improve our understanding of the total mass change and to evaluate atmospheric models, which are typically used for ice sheet-wide mass balance studies."

In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) project, the student is working to understand the mechanisms by which forest recovery from acid rain may increase the vulnerability of soil organic matter that contains soil carbon and nutrients. The investigators are particularly interested in understanding how rising soil acidity and calcium content may alter the solubility and lability (decomposability) of soil carbon.  The project will test this by studying the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils in response to changing acidity.  This research is necessary to predict  future trends of forest growth and carbon storage throughout the Northeastern United States. To facilitate and inform evidence-based management decisions, this research will be incorporated into a web-based application that is geared toward letting the general public explore and understand long-term ecological data.<br/> <br/>To examine the mechanisms by which ecosystem recovery from acid rain may alter soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, the researchers will perform a long-term greenhouse mesocosm experiment. Soils will be collected from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a Northeastern hardwood forest that is impacted by acid rain. The team will reconstruct soil mesocosms by horizon, both with and without sugar maple seedlings, a co-dominant species in the forest where the soils were obtained. Soils will be experimentally amended to increase soil pH and Ca in a fully factorial design. The student will measure SOM solubility and microbial respiration of SOM to determine the responses of SOM pools to these treatments. In addition, researchers will measure proximate mechanisms of SOM dynamics (Aluminum-SOM complexation, soil exoenzyme activity, bacterial:fungal microbial biomass ratios, etc.) that may drive changes to SOM solubility and microbial respiration. These measurements will be compared between planted and unplanted mesocosm to identify possible plant-mediated effects on SOM dynamics."

While the possibilities are many, there are also doubts about how far these methods will go - and what new theoretical foundations may be required to take them to the next level overcoming possible hurdles. Recently, machine learning has undergone a paradigm shift with increasing reliance on  stochastic optimization to train highly non-convex models -- including but not limited to deep nets. Theoretical understanding has lagged behind, primarily because most problems in question are provably intractable on worst-case instances. Furthermore, traditional machine learning theory is mostly concerned with classification, whereas much practical success is driven by unsupervised learning and representation learning. Most past theory of representation learning was focused on simple models such as k-means clustering and PCA, whereas  practical work uses vastly more complicated models like autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines and deep generative models. The proposal presents an ambitious agenda for extending theory to embrace and support these practical trends, with hope of influencing practice. Theoretical foundations will be provided for the next generation of machine learning methods and optimization algorithms. <br/><br/>The project may end up having significant impact on  practical machine learning, and even cause a cultural change in the field -- theory as well as practice -- with long-term ramifications. Given the ubiquity as well as  economic and scientific implications of machine learning today, such impact will extend into other disciplines, especially in (ongoing) collaborations with researchers in neuroscience. The project will train a new generation of machine learning researchers, through an active teaching and mentoring plan at all levels, from undergrad to postdoc. This new generation will be at ease combining cutting edge theory and applications. There is a pressing need for such people today, and the senior PIs played a role in training/mentoring several existing ones.<br/> <br/>Technical contributions will include new theoretical models of knowledge representation and semantics, and also frameworks for proving convergence of nonconvex optimization routines. Theory will be developed to explain and exploit the interplay between representation learning and supervised learning that has proved so empirically successful in deep learning, and seems to underlie new learning paradigms such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and interactive learning. Attempts will be made to replace neural models with models with more ""interpretable""  attributes and performance curves.  All PIs have a track record of combining theory with practice. They  are also devoted to a heterodox research approach, borrowing from all the past phases of machine learning: interpretable representations from the earlier phases (which relied on logical representations, or probabilistic models), provable guarantees from the middle phase (convex optimization, kernels etc.), and an embrace of nonconvex methods from the latest deep net phase. Such eclecticism is uncommon in machine learning, and may give rise to new paradigms and new kinds of science."

Engineering programs present considerable challenges, including the need to motivate students and the need for students to have positive attitudes toward learning. Prior research demonstrates that high motivation and positive attitudes towards learning occur when students feel in control of their own learning, place a high value on what they are studying, can regulate their anxiety, and recover from setbacks.  While asking students questions about these issues is useful, there is a more direct way to study them - by measuring students' physical responses in real time. A unique element of this study is that in addition to surveys, the investigators will monitor students' body stress responses through sweat and saliva to capture students' anxiety during an exam. The intellectual merit of this ECR project is to broaden understanding of factors related to success using physical signs that a student cannot consciously control and of which they may not even be aware. The broader impacts of this research will come from integrating students' reported perceptions with their unconscious responses to better understand students' emotional and motivational responses to learning, especially those of underrepresented students, who face even greater challenges.  This ECR project will support innovative learning environments that promote student success and entrance into the workforce.<br/><br/>More specifically, the intellectual merit of this project is to extend theories of motivation and emotion by integrating physiological responses of students with more traditional measures to better predict student beliefs and behaviors, as well as performance on accepted metrics of success in engineering programs. In addition to surveys, we will use physiological markers based on sweat on the skin (electrodermal activity) and saliva (particularly hormonal markers) to capture students' emotion and anxiety during an authentic exam setting associated with a foundational engineering course. The project will also be integrative in drawing upon theoretical and practical knowledge from engineering education, psychology, physiology, and the learning sciences. It will also broaden understanding of factors related to student emotion, motivation and self-regulation using physical signals that a student cannot self-report as they cannot consciously control and may not even be aware of. The broader impact will come from applying these findings to improving student outcomes, especially those of underrepresented students, who are trying to succeed in an especially challenging environment."

A covert channel is any mechanism through which two parties simultaneously accessing the same computer intentionally communicate, despite this mechanism being disallowed for communication.  Examples of both channels abound, and their presence makes our computation and communication infrastructure less secure: side channels allow attackers to glean sensitive information that they would not otherwise be able to access, and covert channels enable unauthorized disclosure between users. <br/><br/>This project enables engineers to attenuate side- and convert channels, thereby making our electronic infrastructure less vulnerable to external attack and internal leaks. In the process, the project enables a new collaboration between researchers in information theory, computer architecture, and communication networks. The project broadens participation of under-represented groups, especially women, through research opportunities and an improved mentoring program for a professional society.<br/><br/>This project approaches the study of side- and covert channels information theoretically.  Historically, information theory has provided relatively little assistance toward mitigating side- and covert channels. This is partly because it is unclear how to quantify the amount of information leaked through a side channel and partly because many side- and covert channels involve a receiver that can actively control the channel. Such receivers are not well understood.<br/><br/>To address these two impediments, the project develops a recently-proposed metric for measuring leakage in side-channels that is operationally justified and easily computed. The project also develops results that enable one to predict how active receivers will act. The project culminates in the application of these results to three specific scenarios spanning communication networks and multi-core processors."

Current state-of-the-art algorithms do so by maintaining an awareness of humans with single-modality data models, for example limb positions derived from a camera. However, approaches using only a single input modality typically neglect other potentially critical sources of information. In addition, they are prone to noise, failures, or line-sight problems, since no redundant data sources are available. This project will address this issue with the development of a machine learning algorithm which performs human intention inference and determines an appropriate robot response for human-robot interaction using multi-modal data sources, such as camera, accelerometer, shoe-based pressure sensor, and electromyography data. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shuhei Ikemoto and Dr. Koh Hosoda at Osaka University, who specialize in biologically-inspired robotics and human-robot interaction. This project benefits from Dr. Ikemoto's and Dr. Hosoda's invaluable expertise, as well as access to a human-inspired, pneumatically-actuated robot located at Osaka University which will enable unique human-robot interaction scenarios that are not currently possible at the researcher's institution.<br/><br/>Interaction Primitives are a state-of-the-art framework for modeling the interaction that takes place between a robot and a human during collaborative, physical activities. However, this existing framework is designed to work in low dimensional space with a single data modality for each agent.

At the same time, the number of training samples will remain constant, since that is physically constrained by the number of demonstrations that can be performed. To resolve this issue, this project will develop an extension of Interaction Primitives capable of performing density estimation with high dimension, low sample size data sets with the goal of producing safer, and more accurate interactions.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

The invented Li-S batteries are important because they can deliver up to five times higher energy density compared to current commercial Li-ion batteries that have over 90% market share in various applications including computers, tablets, phones, drones, and electric vehicles. Furthermore, the invented Li-S batteries can be charged and discharged 800 times with high (80~90%) capacity retention, and the price of the raw material (sulfur) is at least 300 times lower than that of cobalt-containing active materials used in Li-ion batteries.  Since modern life includes various electronic/electrical devices that have made electrical energy storage indispensable, potential impacts from high energy density and low-cost rechargeable batteries are important.  The most important unique feature of the invented Li-S batteries is ahigh sulfur (active material) loading in the sponge cathode, which allows for storing a large amount of energy in actual battery packs. The project will result in a continuous bulk-manufacturing method of the sponge for commercial mass-production as well as optimum synthesis conditions to control the pore size and morphology of the sponge.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the technology gaps related to mass-production as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The high sulfur loading is enabled by the sponge-like porous bulk, serving as an excellent electron transport channel and polysulfide reservoir.  The covalently connected CNTs not only provide excellent electron transport channels, but also completely eliminate insulating binders (inactive materials) that are used in typical Li-ion batteries to hold powdery raw materials.  To mass-produce the CNT sponge, the researchers will investigate a method of continuously delivering the catalyst to the reaction zone as well as optimum reaction conditions for continuous bulk manufacturing.  Then the pore size and surface condition of the CNT will be optimized to maximally accommodate sulfur loadings for higher performances.  Finally battery prototypes will be fabricated for testing and comparison with the current commercial Li-ion batteries.  <br/><br/>This project will provide graduate students with unique opportunities in the process of technology transfer in addition to technology development such as engaging the students in lab-to-market processes as well as educating how to deliver technical information to business and non-technical consumers.

As such, these structures are highly susceptible to large vibrations induced by extreme loads, particularly those caused by earthquakes or wind events. This can lead to significant economic impact as a result of extensive repairs that are required prior to building re-occupancy. In order to increase the post-event functionality of midrise to super-tall steel structures and better control the structural response and location of damage, this research will assess the ability of strategically placed non-traditional civil engineering materials to reduce structural vibrations. Specifically, high energy dissipating materials such as carbon and polymer foams will be placed within the often underutilized voids of structural members and subjected to large-scale shake table loading to simulate seismic loads. Experimental testing will be supplemented by numerical models that will allow for the assessment of building displacements and accelerations considering different levels and location of the high energy dissipating materials. This research will be conducted at Kyoto University under the guidance of Associate Professor Masahiro Kurata. His expertise in large scale and numerical testing of steel systems, coupled with the facilities of Kyoto University, make Japan an ideal location to conduct this research.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to mitigate the structural response of steel systems under extreme loads. Specifically, the main objectives are to assess the ability of non-traditional civil engineering materials to provide damping under seismic loading and determine what levels and location of this supplemental damping will provide the greatest reduction in structural response. In order to enhance the robustness and resilience of structures, the amount of permanent damage incurred after an extreme event must be minimized. To this end, an existing steel moment frame setup will be utilized with a shake table to simulate the effects of seismic ground motion. Response time histories (displacement, acceleration) and localized damage will be used to assess the performance of the steel frame with and without the supplemental damping system. A significant parametric study utilizing numerical models will augment the experimental testing, and results from both investigations will be used to develop recommendations for the use of non-traditional materials as a means to provide customizable distributed damping.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

This project is a collaboration with the Northeast Institute in Changchun, China, and will build upon a growing knowledge base on the impacts of temperature increase on wetlands working with host researcher Dr. ChangChun Song. The Institute has operated open-top warming chambers, which warm the inside 1-2C (comparable to what is forecasted for climate change over the coming decades), for almost 10 years. By studying the effects of these chambers, the researcher will determine how a long-term temperature increase impacts different types of bacteria that produce and consume methane. High-latitude wetlands store an enormous amount of carbon that could be released to the atmosphere, and high latitudes are predicted to experience a greater temperature increase than low latitudes in the coming years. However, there is some uncertainty on how methane emissions from northern wetlands will be impacted by a warmer climate due to changes in the methane-producing and methane-consuming patterns of these bacteria. This field-based experiment is a unique opportunity to better understand how greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands will be impacted by climate change.<br/><br/>The quantity of methane production in high-latitude wetlands under elevated temperatures is a matter of scientific uncertainty, but relevant to the global carbon cycle. Understanding the fluxes and drivers of greenhouse gas emissions is a goal of the Northeast Institute, which maintains the open top chambers, and monitors greenhouse gas emissions, soil chemical properties, and vegetation parameters. My experiment will utilize the experimental warming chambers, as well as sampling and experimental protocols previously established by the group, to determine the impact of 1-2C warming on methane-cycling bacterial activity during the summer. The 8-week study will include 1) collecting soil samples from open-top warming chambers operated by the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 2) analysis of the expression of functional genes involved in microbial production and oxidation of methane using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique. Results will help predict future rates of methane emission from high-latitude wetlands that are extremely sensitive to climate change. The data will also further a comparative study on responses of indigenous microbial community to global climate change in the Sanjiang Plain (cold and organic-rich) and Mississippi River Deltaic Plain (warm and organic-rich) wetlands.

Fossil and genetic data provide deep insights into human history. Yet there are many important questions left unanswered. Recent research has found evidence of Neanderthal genes in modern humans. Scientists have shown that this shared DNA resulted from interbreeding during periods where modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped in time and space. What scientists have not been able to do is determine are the specific times, places and social context of this interbreeding. The human genetic data does not allow us to differentiate brief events from prolonged interbreeding. However, the distinct populations of lice that live on different human populations should remain distinct unless those human populations have prolonged and intimate contact. Therefore, this research will use louse genes to determine when, where, and for what duration these humans were in close contact in the distant past.  The researchers will collect lice from populations in northern Africa, and the Middle East where human introgression with Neanderthals is thought to have first occurred. Genetic data from these lice will be collected and examined to explore patterns of human evolution. This project will train undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher how to effectively communicate research findings to broad audiences. The research team will also help museums promote scientific literacy in Middle School and High School students. <br/><br/>Patterns of DNA variation in the Human Louse (Pedicularis humanus) confirm interactions between now-extinct humans such as Neanderthal and Modern humans. Further, there is even greater evidence of interbreeding between the lice of these two hosts than we see in the hosts themselves. Increased sampling of genomes across a broad geographic range of Louse samples from 90 key geographic populations will allow improved modeling of the location and nature of interactions between Neanderthal and Modern humans. Coalescent simulations will be generated based on the observed characteristics of roughly 10,000 P. humanus genes in 90 populations using the University of Florida's high-performance computer cluster (HiPerGator). Approximate Bayesian Computation will be used to determine what model of human behavior across time best fits the data that is generated."

We know from research that economic globalization and the integration of farmers into global commodity chains often has resulted in rising economic dependence and exclusion, food insecurity, and environmental degradation. These dynamics have been particularly damaging to the viability of smallholding family farmers, who nonetheless continue to produce 80 percent of the global food supply. In light of these global challenges, recent scholarship has identified farmer-led transitions toward local food production as a new and sustainable path for rural development. Understanding the factors that promote sustainable transitions to local food production is therefore critical for advancing effective programs and policies that support future rural development efforts. This research will contribute essential support to the PhD training of a female anthropologist. It will also build local research capacities by offering assistantships for three rural youth and will enhance international scientific collaboration. Collaborative engagement strategies will enable findings to inform planning efforts that will facilitate the delivery of more effective support to farming communities. Results will also be disseminated via academic conferences and publications in journals that focus on agriculture, environment, and rural development issues.<br/><br/>Research will be conducted in Dominica, a rural island in the Eastern Caribbean. Dominica is a particularly apt research setting because since the 1990s, agricultural livelihoods there have transitioned from export commodity production to diverse forms of local food production. Although these transitions are associated with positive outcomes including high levels of food security and economic growth, there is currently little known about how farmers have been able to rework local relations and practices of production and exchange. The research will focus on smallholder farming households in three sites that allow for comparison of agricultural livelihoods in distinct social and environmental conditions. Investigators will assess how and why smallholders have responded to changing global conditions by shifting away from export production. Investigators will also assess the impacts of these responses by determining how variable access to resources, markets, and development support reflect diversity in agricultural practices and which of these factors promote sustainable livelihood outcomes for farming families and communities. Investigators will engage in long-term site visits to conduct surveys and interviews, and to participate in and observe agricultural activities. Findings from this research will provide a model for sustainable agricultural transitions; one that can be generalized to other contexts facing similar global dynamics."

Medieval artisans decorated the walls of the Alhambra palace with beautiful depictions of planar symmetries also known, in modern language, as 2-dimensional crystallographic groups. There is great power in abstraction, and the study of symmetry leaped forward in the mid 19th century when mathematicians formulated the abstract concept of a group. These advances enabled a flowering of applications to science, such as the use of 3-dimensional crystallographic groups to explore the atomic structure of crystalline arrays. Modern geometric group theory is a vast abstraction of the study of crystallographic groups. The research accomplished under this award will advance our understanding of geometric group theory by focusing on a class of groups at the current frontier of knowledge, namely the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of free groups. These groups encode symmetries and other relations amongst networks which mathematicians call graphs. Work under this award will involve construction of new models of relations and symmetries amongst graphs, leading to the discovery and proof of new theorems in geometric group theory. Some of this work will be carried out by graduate students under the advisement of the principal investigator, and mathematical monographs aimed at beginning graduate students will be produced to aid in their training and for use by the broader mathematical community.<br/><br/>Research activity under this award (expected to be joint work with Michael Handel of CUNY) will focus on studying the large scale geometry of the groups Aut(F) and Out(F), the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of a free group F of finite rank. In large scale geometry one studies a group by its actions on various geometries, focusing not on small scale features of those geometries, but instead on differences and commonalities of large scale features. Under this award Aut(F) and Out(F) will be studied by developing hierarchy theories for these groups, in analogy to hierarchy theories used so successfully to study the large scale geometry of mapping class groups of surfaces. Constructing a hierarchy theory requires, at a minimum, actions of the group and various of its subgroups on hyperbolic geodesic metric spaces. Some things are known already about a hierarchy for Out(F), including actions representing the top of a hierarchy. But there remain many large gaps in our knowledge of this topic. To plug gaps in the middle of an Out(F) hierarchy, one strategy to be pursued under this award will be constructing actions representing the top of Aut(A) hierarchies for free factors A of F. Another strategy will be constructing actions that encode Dehn twist behavior, needed to plug gaps at the bottom of an Out(F) hierarchy. Medium term applications are expected to reveal geometric properties of word and conjugacy problems for Out(F). Longer term applications may include shedding light on deep conjectures about finite asymptotic dimension and quasi-isometric rigidity of Out(F). Graduate work done under this award is expected to extend hierarchy methods beyond outer automorphism groups of free groups to include broader categories of outer automorphism groups."

They form the basic ingredients of our visual perception and inspire the development of far reaching mathematical tools. Yet despite centuries of study, and an abundance of potential applications, there are still many fundamental open problems in this area which are strikingly intuitive and elementary to state. Studying these problems may stimulate useful developments in mathematics, or lead to wider applications in science and technology. For instance, the Principal Investigator's work on rigidity problem for surfaces may have applications for stability of complicated domes in modern architecture, or various physical frameworks. Further, various techniques which the Principal Investigator is proposing to develop could be useful in computer aided design, mathematical physics, and the emerging field of discrete differential geometry.  Finally, these problems are ideal for introducing the general public to the exciting world of modern day mathematics, and arousing the interest of beginning students in Geometry.<br/><br/>The PI's research on curves and surfaces, and more generally Riemannian submanifolds, spans a wide range of topics including isometric embeddings, h-principle theory, isoperimetric problems, geometric knot theory, polyhedral approximations, and connections with real algebraic geometry. Some recurring themes throughout these investigations are various notions of convexity or optimization, and the interaction between geometric and topological concepts, or local versus global properties of submanifolds. More specifically, a typical problem is how restrictions on curvature, intrinsic metric, or various boundary conditions, influence the global shape of a curve or a hypersurface, or even allow an embedding of that object in a Euclidean space of low codimension. A fundamental problem in this area is that of isometric rigidity of surfaces: can one continuously deform a smooth closed surface in Euclidean space without changing its intrinsic metric? The PI also considers a number of related problems involving the self-linking number or vertices of closed curves, spherical images of closed surfaces, and various deformations of submanifolds which preserve the sign or magnitude of the curvature. Other projects include unfoldings of convex polytopes, and the study of the cut locus or medial axis of contractible regions in Euclidean space."

Recent theoretical insights hold that conceptual knowledge about emotion (e.g. how we think about and conceptualize emotions like anger) helps us rapidly understand the meaning of emotional facial expressions. This offers a possible explanation for cultural differences that have been observed between Western and East Asian (e.g. Japanese) people perceive emotions from facial expressions. This study will use neuroimaging (functional MRI) to measure the way that emotions such as ""anger"" and ""fear"" are represented in the brains of Japanese and American participants when they view emotional facial expressions. By also measuring each participant's concepts about emotion, we will be able to show the influence of emotion concepts on the way the brain processes emotion. We hypothesize that cultural differences in conceptual knowledge will be the strongest influence on cultural differences in emotion perception. This research will help scientists understand where cultural differences in emotion come from, and will also inform important debates about how emotions are processed in the brain. Aside from its theoretical contributions, this research will inform clinical research on conditions such as autism that reduce patients' ability to perceive emotions accurately. This study will be a collaborative effort between the fellow and Dr. Norihiro Sadato of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Dr. Sadato is an expert in the field of human neuroimaging with an enthusiasm for participating in cross-cultural psychological and neuroscientific research with scientists from the U.S.<br/><br/>Recent accounts of emotion perception and person construal suggest that conceptual knowledge about emotion categories is able to provide a top-down influence on emotion perception before emotion categorizations have fully stabilized. This theoretical approach offers a new route for understanding cultural differences between Western and East Asian subjects in emotion perception. Thus far, many researchers have interpreted these differences as reflecting different cultural norms between American and Japanese participants in how emotions are interpreted and reported. However, we predict that the strongest predictor of cultural differences in emotion perception will be differences in emotion concept knowledge between cultures. To test this, we will perform an fMRI task that measures patterns of neural activity in response to emotional facial expressions, as well as a behavioral task in which we index the conceptual structure of emotion categories and similarity in how they are perceived. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) we will index the correspondence between conceptual similarity, perceptual similarity, and neural pattern similarity. These results will inform ongoing debates in social and affective neuroscience on the way that emotion is processed and represented in the brain, and the way that cultural differences observed in behavior can manifest at the level of neural representation.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

In materials science a material design problem that exploits the chemistry-processing-microstructure-properties paradigm is often expensive, time consuming and limited by the available resources. Thus, to achieve a design goal, one must carefully select the information source to query, which could be an experiment, a computational simulation, elicitation of expert opinion, etc., based on the value added to the design problem, as well as the time/cost associated with performing the query. The complex microstructures in advanced steels result in significant improvements in strength and ductility compared to conventional steels. This makes such steels especially attractive for automotive applications, where vehicle weight reduction and crashworthiness are paramount. The approach is a completely new and potentially transformative way of looking at materials design in general. Here, experiments, simulations, and prior knowledge are accounted for at the same level, potentially alleviating major drawbacks of established paradigms in that there is no longer any required alignment between inputs and outputs of computational or experimental methods. The information source fidelity is implicitly accounted for, and the design framework can efficiently allocate limited resources to the materials design task in an information-economic sense. The research will also be integrated with the NSF Research and Traineeship Program at Texas A&M and outreach to broader communities through existing programs at Texas A&M.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to exploit the chemistry-processing-microstructure-properties paradigm in materials design within a framework that facilitates the integration of multiple information sources. It prescribes optimal information acquisition protocols that balance exploration and exploitation of the design space. This framework will extend state-of-the-art knowledge gradient policies for value of information based optimal querying of information sources. Key contributions of the framework include enabling parallel querying of correlated information sources by fitting Gaussian process models to learned correlations; incorporation of information sources with differing input/output spaces by leveraging high dimensional model representations; and multi-objective policies that provide scalar indicators of expected improvement through novel importance reweighting of prior queried information into state-of-the-art hypervolume indicators. Contrary to many existing materials design frameworks, the framework directly connects materials chemistry/processing to property, avoiding issues related to discrepancies between optimality and feasibility. The framework will be able to accommodate predictions of mechanical properties with models of different resolution and, more importantly, allows for the integration of experiments and prior knowledge within the same unified framework. Although the demonstration focus is on low alloy multi-phase advanced steels, the methodology is potentially applicable to a wide range of materials systems."

Although these data are well defined for at risk faults in the U.S., they are lacking for many large and potentially destructive faults elsewhere. Myanmar is an important location to study because of its role in an active strain-partitioned plate boundary and high potential for damaging earthquakes. Myanmar contains many active faults because it accommodates the northward motion of India's collision with Eurasia via strain partitioning. The Sagaing fault is a 1200-km-long right-lateral strike-slip (dextral) fault that accommodates the lateral component of India's northward collision with Eurasia. However, GPS data indicate that the Sagaing fault strains at a rate of ~18 mm/yr, only half the rate of India's movement. Why the Sagaing fault accommodates only half the dextral motion remains unknown, and the locations and rates of other faults that accommodate lateral deformation are not well constrained. The research will be conducted at the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) under the guidance of Dr. Charles Rubin and Dr. Wang Yu, the foremost expert on the tectonics of Myanmar.<br/><br/>This project integrates geologic (slip rates and recurrence intervals) and geodetic (satellite radar) data to investigate spatial and temporal constraints on the location and magnitude of dextral faulting in Myanmar. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data processed in time series will be used to investigate interseismic strain. Paleoseismic trenching will be employed to constrain fault slip rates and earthquake recurrence intervals. Initial work will focus on the Meiktila Segment of the Sagaing fault, a ~200-km-long seismic gap situated between two of Myanmar's largest cities.

As such, this study will build on an emerging body of research about ways to broaden the representation of the African American undergraduate students in STEM fields. This type of research is highly important since studies show that racial bias weaken scientific identity in STEM by triggering and perpetuating threatening stereotypes that African Americans do not have the capacity and skills to become scientists. To that end, this  project will employ a stereotype inoculation model to test whether environments characterized by majorities of marginalized group members serve to reduce the negative effects of stereotypes, protect identity development, and facilitate self-efficacy and career-related motivation. The study will compare perceptions of campus climate and academic mentoring relationships using populations of undergraduate students from two universities. It will look at specific factors that both exacerbate and buffer the negative effects of racial stereotypes, as well as the implications that they, in turn, have for the development of an adaptive science identity.  <br/><br/>This project will test three conceptual models grounded in the stereotype inoculation framework. The first model will portray an erosion process whereby scientific disidentification increases as a function of racial bias and stereotype threat. A second counteractive model will test the potentially facilitative effects of racial identity on scientific self-efficacy through its spillover effect on scientific identity. The third model will examine the unconditional latent growth of implicit scientific identity, as well as the time-varying effects of students' perceptions of their mentoring relationships on the identity outcomes. Data will be collected from cohorts comprising more than 500 STEM majors attending the two universities participating in the project. Outcomes from this work will advance stereotype inoculation theory development through its innovative contextual focus on the micro- and macro-level processes that influence African American science students' STEM career attitudes. The study will also (a) provide insights into the mediating role that multiple identities, both racial and scientific identity, play in buffering these stereotypes, and (b) identify the interpersonal ingredients that comprise effective faculty-student relationships that give shape to multiculturally inclusive academic climates"

The present research project is conducted in zebrafish because of advantageous genetic and experimental tools available for studying early eye development. Previous studies carried out by this research team found two proteins that need to function properly for retinas to develop (called DCBLD1 and DCBLD2); if these proteins aren't made, retinas don't form properly.  Replacing a defective fish DBCLD2 protein with a human DCBLD2 protein enables the fish retina to develop normally, suggesting that DCBLD proteins function in a similar manner in all animals with backbones. The present project will examine the mechanisms by which DCBLD proteins govern proper retina formation using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, cell biological, functional genetic and proteomic techniques, and will provide a more complete understanding of retina formation.  Broader impacts of this research include laboratory training for high school students, university undergraduates, graduate students, and staff scientists in many modern experimental approaches. Several of the students will be specifically recruited from populations that are underrepresented in science. The research and training will be conducted by an inter-disciplinary team in Vermont (the University of Vermont and Norwich University), Massachusetts (Boston College) and Puerto Rico (the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras and the Metropolitan University).<br/><br/>Previous work by the principal investigators determined that the putative neuronal guidance receptors DCBLD1 and 2 act as scaffolds for the Crk family of adaptors, which are known to play important roles in the positioning of neurons during development.

Human DCBLD2 was shown to rescue dcbld2 morphant phenotypes. The following research aims will be conducted to delineate the roles of Dcbld1 and 2 in zebrafish eye development: Aim1 will use immunohistochemistry to determine how loss of Dcbld1 and 2 affects cell proliferation and the differentiation of zebrafish retinal cell types.

Harbor seals are found to be able to track their prey by capturing even minute disturbance of the ambient water solely by using their whiskers. This is attributed to the exceptional capability of seal whiskers to suppress vortex-induced vibration in the wake flow. This project will conduct flow experiments of seal whiskers at Pohang University of Science and Technology University (POSTECH) in South Korea, under the mentorship of Professor Sang Joon Lee. The collaboration provides flow facilities and equipment to obtain unique data that will enable new insights into the wake structure of multiple seal whiskers and its implication to design high-sensitivity underwater flow sensors. <br/><br/>Many researchers have studied the effects of key parameters of the whisker morphology on wake structure with idealized whisker-like models. However, due to the natural variation in length, size and twist along the length of seal whiskers, it is not well understood how a real seal whisker changes wake flow, in particular the vortex shedding. It is also unclear how a group of whiskers with a certain configuration interact with each other to affect the wake properties. Lack of knowledge of the wake structure generated by multiple seal whiskers in a group hinders the capability to design whisker-inspired high-sensitivity underwater flow sensors. The goal of this research is to understand the wake of multiple seal whiskers of various configurations at the Reynolds number similar to which harbor seal whiskers are subject to. Experiments will be conducted in a water tunnel using Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV). The results will provide insights of how individual wakes interact with each other and if the interaction is beneficial to suppress the vortex shedding. This research will fill the gap of understanding the wake structure that multiple real seal whiskers create. Ultimately knowledge will be used to develop high-sensitivity underwater flow sensors for AUVs operating in a complex environment.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Often, the binding of one protein changes the binding affinity of a different protein at a distant site on the DNA molecule. This phenomenon is called ""allostery""; it has been extensively studied in enzymes, but not through DNA which has mostly been regarded as a rigid object that provides binding sites for proteins.  Allostery through DNA has been implicated in many previous experimental studies, including in the binding of drug molecules, but it has not been understood through a mechanical theory which regards DNA as an elastic (not rigid) molecule that is locally deformed by the binding proteins. Similar elastic deformations caused by proteins binding to lipid bilayers also result in allosteric interactions that are responsible for cellular processes, such as, endo- and exo-cytosis required for transport of materials into and out of cells. Often, allostery also involves entropic forces between the proteins that are the result of fluctuations caused by Brownian motion of the elastic media (DNA or lipid membrane) separating them. The overall goal of this research program is to quantitatively describe allosteric interactions between proteins on DNA and lipid membranes through a mathematical theory that regards them as elastic objects while accounting for their Brownian fluctuations.  The model will significantly improve understanding of how genes are regulated in living cells. The project will include instruction of graduate students, mentoring of undergraduates and masters students.  The PI will also perform outreach through  organizing symposia and advanced schools in international conferences, and working with the Penn MRSEC and the Nano Bio Interface Center for NanoDay and other activities targeted at high school (minority) students and teachers.<br/><br/>This project will advance the fundamental understanding of allosteric interactions through DNA, thus addressing long-standing open questions in the field and providing quantitative explanations for the wealth of experimental data on the subject. In particular, this project will show how a birod model for DNA can describe the deformations caused by proteins at a single base-pair level, and how the energy due to these deformations is sinusoidally modulated due the helical nature of DNA. For proteins on lipid membranes this project will show how self-assembly may be caused by the competition of their elastic and entropic interactions. The new theoretical approaches developed in this project will enable quantitative predictions of allosteric interactions between proteins as a function of the mechanical properties of the DNA or membrane and the boundary conditions imposed on them by the binding proteins. The analysis performed in this project will place allosteric interactions of proteins on DNA and lipid membranes in the broader context of theories for the interactions of defects in elastic solids."

CBL has internationally recognized strength in fisheries science and studies of marine, coastal, and wetland ecosystems. Its mission is to conduct basic and applied research with a truly global reach and some emphasis on the Chesapeake Bay, as well as graduate education conducted within the Marine Estuarine Environmental Sciences (MEES) program of the University of Maryland. The research of the chemistry group at CBL ranges from environmental pollution to climate change, and from tropical coral reefs to the High Arctic, while relying firmly on advanced analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS). Because increasing analytical capabilities at CBL is important to its continued success, a powerful MS instrument will be acquired with a second, linked device that separates organic compounds. Together, these instruments will allow innovative studies of specific, biologically important molecules. The new equipment will upgrade and replace two older instruments, significantly improving the sensitivity of measurements and the ability to analyze very challenging samples, such as seawater, wastewaters, and sediments. It will strongly support ongoing studies of important toxic metals (mercury, selenium, cadmium) but also open up entirely new fields of research. In addition, the new equipment will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students for a highly competitive job market and to stimulate educational outreach to local schools and the general public, in part through the CBL Visitor Center.<br/><br/>A triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-QQQ), coupled directly to a metal-free 'BioInert' liquid chromatograph (LC), will be purchased at CBL. This new equipment will impel a forward leap in analytical capability to advance and reinvigorate marine biochemical research for its geochemistry group, as well as for numerous affiliated faculty and students inside and outside UMCES, over the next 5-10 years. The acquisition will enhance interdisciplinary marine research, professional training, and public awareness of environmental bioscience. The unique coupled LC/ICP-QQQ instrument enables characterization and quantification of nanomolar amounts of biogenic compounds containing specific combinations of elements, for example sulfur-based ligands bound to Hg, or iodinated organochlorines. The ability to exclusively target such compounds will remove a major analytical hurdle in the research of many CBL faculty. The ICP-QQQ exceeds the mass resolution of more expensive sector-field ICP-MS, yet with greatly superior detection limits, and will complement ultrahigh-resolution organic MS, compound-specific stable isotope MS, photochemical, chromatographic, trace metal, biomolecular, and genetic techniques already available at CBL and three other UMCES research units. Fundamental and longstanding questions to be addressed include the roles of non-volatile organic sulfur compounds in the marine sulfur cycle, of sulfur-based ligands in microbial Hg methylation, and of metal-specific organic ligands in marine primary production. The Chesapeake Bay is eminently suited for this research due to the seasonal anoxia of its deep waters and the regular emergence of summertime dead zones, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and its abundance of tidal wetlands. The new instrument will expose graduate students to state-of-the-art molecular/mass spectrometric and chromatographic techniques and will allow CBL faculty to explore novel directions in marine biogeochemistry, ecotoxicology, proteomics, climate science etc. More detailed descriptions of CBL, its scientists, research, and facilities can be found on the website http://www.umces.edu/cbl"

To probe the timescales of magma mobilization, chemical information contained within crystals that were growing in a magma reservoir can be extracted and used to gain insight into the timing of any changes in the conditions and processes that occurred in the magma reservoir before eruption. This project will investigate potential signals of magma mobilization in the pre-eruption growth record of quartz crystals found within the enormous (2800 km3) Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT), which explosively erupted 74,000 years ago from Toba Caldera in Sumatra, Indonesia. The research will be conducted at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore under the mentorship of Dr. Fidel Costa, a noted expert in applying chemical zoning and diffusion in crystals to timescales of magmatic system processes. <br/><br/>Striking near-rim zonation present within YTT quartz crystals under cathodoluminescence imaging is indicative of distinct of periods of growth for these crystals, and often with a final stage under different temperature or pressure conditions. The boundary between crystal zones represents a chemical disequilibrium where, through time at magmatic temperatures, elements will diffuse in the crystal to attain equilibrium. For this project, titanium and aluminum concentrations will be measured across crystal zone boundaries to determine the magnitude of diffusional relaxation that has occurred. The yielded diffusion profiles will then be matched to numerically modeled time-dependent profiles to determine the time elapsed between zone growth and eruption. The coupling of titanium diffusional relaxation with that of aluminum in quartz is a novel approach that should yield more robust temporal constraints and interpretations than one element alone. The results will allow the researchers to determine the onset of near-eruption quartz crystallization events, and the potential relation of these events to YTT magma system mobilization and/or alternative processes, such as syn-eruptive decompression. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

They have a broad mission to collaborate with other research and educational institutions, engage in innovative projects to conserve habitats and species, and help make the public case for sustainability. In addition, modern zoos have a responsibility to understand and present the challenges between conservation and animal welfare ethics in order to balance animal rights with conservation. Unlike the animal welfare or rights viewpoint, the conservation standpoint gives precedence to endangered species, and says that the willingness to protect ecosystems defines moral consideration of wild species. Discrepancies between animal welfare and conservation occur when the rights or interests of individual animals conflict with the need to preserve ecosystems or a particular species. Because the welfare of individual animals is often sacrificed at the expense of conservation research, the two concepts have traditionally been thought to be incompatible. Created as a place for leisure in 1984, the Seoul Grand Park Zoo in South Korea only recently made conservation a core priority and improved animal care under the influence of the animal rights movement. However, not only does the Seoul Zoo still lack resources and funds both for the development of animal welfare and conservation research, but South Korea also has very little legislation protecting the welfare of zoo animals. By focusing on the Seoul Zoo's direct involvement in the conservation of three different animals (the Asiatic black bear, the red fox, and the Asian leopard cat), this research aims to determine the degree to which the institution prioritizes individual animal welfare in their conservation endeavors. This project will be conducted at Ewha Women's University, under the guidance of Professor Jae Chun Choe, a prominent biologist who has spurred conversations on the treatment of animals in zoos and is active in researching improvements in animal welfare science for captive animals. This collaboration could help provide a framework to aid in the improvement of the welfare of Korean zoo animals and make for more humane scientific education and conservation methods.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the Seoul Grand Park Zoo's conservation endeavors within the framework of compassionate conservation, where empathy plays a role in conservation decision-making. The application of this concept's guiding principle ""first do no harm"" in education programs, zoological institutions, dealings with invasive species, the capture and tagging of endangered animals, and other acts related to protecting ecosystems, can help encourage a peaceful coexistence between humanity and the natural world. The research project will complete an ethnographic analysis of the Seoul Zoo's current conservation and education programs. The researcher will analyze several conversations with Seoul Zoo officials, Korean academics, and conservation experts, which will reveal the zoo?s struggles in balancing its different welfare and conservation priorities, especially in its current projects to the breeding and propagation of three different species: the Asiatic black bear, the red fox, and the Asian leopard cat. Compassionate conservation aims to use techniques in animal welfare science to inform and improve conservation methodology.  Using the concepts of animal welfare science as a framework for a broad questionnaire, the project seeks to find out whether the conservation programs at the Seoul Zoo focus on the desires of individual animals as well as the improvement of their health, consciousness and emotions. Such research could provide guidelines for evidence-based decisions to aid in the improvement of legislation concerning the welfare of Korean zoo animals, in turn improving the function of the institution for the Korean people. The results of this project are expected to explore an innovative perspective on the management and conservation priorities of Korean zoos, an underrepresented group in the twenty-first century debate on the role of these modern institutions. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Exercise can increase bone size and help protect against fractures.  This project aims to improve understanding of how bone cells detect bone loading. The bone cell thought to be the load detector is called the ""osteocyte"".  Osteocytes communicate with each other and to other cells on the surface of the bone to change bone size to match the loads on the bone. The goal of the work is to determine how bone deformation and fluid flow are detected and changed into a chemical signal that the cell uses to communicate to other cells.  Mechanical loading will be related to the biological response of the cell using advanced cell biological methods. The outcomes of this research will determine the role of solid-fluid interaction mechanics in the activation of bone formation to help explain and mitigate age related bone loss. The project will offer local high school students, especially female students, one day research camps and encourage them to pursue engineering and medical education. Undergraduate students will work on various aspects of the project.<br/><br/>The objective is to gain a better understanding of the role of multiscale mechanics - from macro-scale bone strains to micro-scale strains (local bone matrix and lacunar strain and the corresponding fluid flow shear stress on the cell membrane) in mechanotransduction at the osteocyte cellular level. We plan to study these effects using the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in osteocytes as a readout for their response to loading. This pathway is known to be important in mediating load related bone formation. The methods include experimental studies using axial loading experiments on mouse whole forearm, novel microscale axial loading experiments on murine ulna sections using the MicroXCT-200 (Carl Zeiss/Xradia) to determine lacunar strains. Newly developed multiplexed 3D confocal microscopy techniques will be used for 3D modelling of osteocytes and their lacunar fluid space for fluid-structure interaction FE models."

This award would deploy to the Poker Flat rocket range located near Fairbanks, Alaska, a state-of-the-art meteor radar system that would make middle atmosphere wind measurements with good height resolution (1-2 km) and good temporal resolution (30 to 60 min). The application of this instrument is to study the dynamics of the Arctic MLT region continually day and night. These new wind observations would be integrated into a study that combines radar and lidar measurements, satellite measurements, and meteorological re-analyses, to understand the wave-driven circulation of the Arctic polar atmosphere. The satellite observations and meteorological re-analyses yield synoptic-scale measurements of the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere.  The lidar observations yield high-resolution height profile temperature and density measurements that allow characterization of the existing planetary waves, tides, and gravity waves. The new radar would yield accurate MLT wind measurements that complete the characterization of these waves and would support modeling efforts aimed at improving the understanding of the wave-driven global circulation. The investigators would use or re-analyze the MERRA (lower atmosphere below 80 km) and SABER profile data (to cover higher altitudes for the range of 90 to 110 km) to characterize the synoptic stratospheric and lower mesospheric activities. The radar observations would help to understand the extent to which nitrogen compounds produced by energetic particle precipitation in the thermosphere contribute to the composition of the lower atmosphere by transport across the MLT region into the stratosphere and the ozone layer. The activity in this new award will support the education and training of students in science and engineering. The award would extend research infrastructure in the Arctic, especially at the Poker Flat Rocket Range, enhance international and national collaborations, and promote collaboration among observers and modelers. The research results will be integrated into the University of Alaska programs and disseminated through a variety of professional, educational, and outreach programs.<br/><br/>Analyses based on temperature and pressure measurements and gradient winds are used to describe planetary wave activity in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, and the circulation follows well-defined synoptic patterns of cyclones and anti-cyclones.

This project focuses on understanding, at the cellular level, how the earliest responses upon injury lead to correct regeneration of missing tissues. How does the animal know that it has lost organs and how does it make the right cells in the right places? Although many animal species can regenerate, the details of the underlying molecular pathways and how these pathways compare across species remain unknown. Biological pathways acquire changes in all species over the course of many generations, but evolution tends to preserve pathways that are essential. Therefore, by studying two species of distantly-related worms that both have impressive regeneration abilities, this project will reveal which aspects of regeneration are shared, and hence essential. The general principles of regeneration identified through this work will have relevance to regenerative medicine. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral researchers involved in this research, the broader impacts of this project include providing hands-on experiences with molecular studies of evolutionary biology to students at local public schools. Teachers will receive training, equipment, supplies, and staff support to implement curriculum that incorporates experimental molecular biology. Direct experiences with how science is practiced in research labs will enhance retention of students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>Technical paragraph:<br/>Many extant lineages of animals can regenerate any missing cell type, raising the possibility that the earliest animals to evolve were capable of ""whole-body"" regeneration. Functional studies of multiple species in phylogenetically informative positions relative to each other are needed to evaluate how the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying regeneration have evolved. This research will leverage the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and the acoel Hofstenia miamia; both regenerate all missing tissues, are easy to culture, and offer high-throughput screening of gene function via RNAi.  Importantly, Hofstenia offers an additional advantage: the availability of accessible embryos, which will enable functional studies of regulatory DNA proposed here. Acoels represent the earliest lineage of animals with bilateral symmetry (Bilateria), and therefore, comparisons of acoels and planarians will reveal the evolution of GRNs over 550 million years of evolution. Wnt signaling, which has a conserved role in correctly specifying tissue identity along the anterior-posterior axis in Hofstenia and Schmidtea, will serve as an anchor-point for a systems-level approach to identify upstream and downstream GRNs. Wound-induced gene networks that control the Wnt pathway will be identified by transcriptome profiling and RNAi. Assays for open chromatin will be used to identify enhancers and direct transcriptional regulators of Wnt pathway components. RNAseq and candidate gene approaches will be used to identify downstream gene networks controlled by Wnt signaling. Together, these experiments will reveal the regulatory mechanisms through which wound-induced gene networks control a putatively conserved module for patterning new tissue in two animal phyla."

Diseases are a major cause of coral mortality, yet there is surprisingly little information on the causes and progression of diseases in corals. Currently there is a widespread coral disease outbreak occurring on the reefs of Florida that has already resulted in massive die-offs in multiple coral species. At least 13 species of corals have been affected with heavily impacted species being reduced to less than 3% of their initial populations. This unprecedented outbreak in multiple species of corals provides a unique but time-sensitive (outbreaks are ephemeral) opportunity to address critical questions about diseases in corals. This project will directly examine disease transmission, explore potential pathogens and examine coral defense mechanisms of affected and resistant species. The combined efforts of multiple researchers and agencies, addressing different components of the disease outbreak, will provide much needed answers to questions concerning marine diseases, which will likely be applicable not only to the Florida coral reefs but to coral diseases world-wide. This research will be beneficial to those who rely on coral reefs as a source for food, recreation, and coastal protection. Furthermore, this project is designed to give the next generation of marine scientists the training and tools to combat coral diseases in the future. <br/><br/>Disease is a complex process emerging under specific host-pathogen-environmental conditions, and outbreaks can often be traced to a disturbance in the balance among the three components. The impact of coral diseases will likely increase in both intensity and geographic extent in the future; however, our ability to understand or manage diseases in coral reef ecosystems has been hampered by the lack of a systematic approach to understanding the pathology and pathogenesis of diseases in corals using multiple epidemiological tools. There is surprisingly little information on whether particular diseases are transmissible to neighboring conspecifics, or whether some diseases are infectious across species boundaries. An outbreak of tissue loss disease in multiple species of corals across the Florida reef tract provides a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to address critical questions about disease pathogenesis in corals. The proposed research will directly test the transmission and infectivity, microbiome changes and host specificity of this disease outbreak and use methods previously utilized by members of the team to isolate and identify the causative agent. The research team will work closely with managers in Florida agencies, attend monthly conference calls and provide regular updates about this work. A postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student intern will be engaged in this research and trained in many areas of microbiology research. Researchers will present lectures to the public at venues such as science museums and environmental education facilities throughout the Florida Keys and Florida east coast."

However, the information learned so far from these sources tends to be explicit, such as, person A was born at location B. This project will investigate methods that can be used to learn implicit knowledge from text such as spatial or temporal properties of concepts. This knowledge can then support many different current challenges in AI, such as narrative generation. This project will be conducted at Toyota Technological University under the mentorship of Dr. Makoto Miwa.

I will specifically look at low level qualia related attributes including temporality, space, sentiment, aesthetics, etc. I will use various corpora in support of this task.

Though species richness often peaks in the tropics, biological diversity is remarkably wide-ranging at both global and local scales. The tropical oceanic island of Sulawesi, Indonesia contains exceptionally high biodiversity, but the murine rodent (rats and mice) fauna is especially remarkable. Some montane communities containing up to 23 co-occurring murine species, making these the richest communities of closely related mammals on the planet. However, despite indistinguishable habitats, some montane communities contain as few as 10 species. The theory of adaptive radiation predicts that, in order to coexist, species in a community must not rely on the same resource, but instead partition resources through variation in diet, habitat, or both. To understand how resources are partitioned, this collaborative project will generate high-resolution morphological and dietary data from museum specimens in the lab of Dr. Kevin Rowe, Curator of Mammals at Museum Victoria. With these data, this project will test the prediction that members of the most species rich communities are existing on a greater diversity of resources from a wider variety of habitats than the less species rich communities.  This project represents an exceptional opportunity for international collaboration while providing evidence that will illuminate how some communities are so diverse, an issue that has puzzled biologists since the earliest days of evolutionary thought.<br/><br/>The theory of adaptive radiation predicts that adequate ecological space must exist for closely related species to co-occur.

However, this diversity is not distributed equally across the island, and some montane communities contain as few as 10 species. This variation provides a natural experiment in community assembly with the potential to illuminate how these hyperdiverse communities originate and are maintained. This collaborative research will use natural history collections at Museum Victoria to determine the ecological niche volume filled by montane communities across Sulawesi, testing the prediction that local community niche volume will be positively correlated with species richness. Niche volume will be quantified using a novel combination of high resolution skeletal imaging (uCT scans), isotopic analyses of diet, and the structure of digestive tracts, providing an integrated view of how Sulawesi rodents exploit available resources.

Mindset has been linked to academic achievement and while much of the research involving mindset and achievement is very promising the most popular measurement tool for mindset, the Dweck Mindset Instrument, is lacking in some areas in showing that it is a valid and reliable instrument to use. One area in particular is if this measurement can work across cultures. This project will work on collecting and evaluating data from the Dweck Mindset Instrument and related constructs in both American and Japanese students in order to better evaluate if this measure is valid. The researcher will be working with Dr. Ayumi Tanaka who has been studying mindset theories at Doshisha University.<br/><br/>One specific psychometric evaluation will determine if the scale has measurement invariance, which gives support to it measuring the same construct in both cultures. If the scale is not measurement invariant it cannot be used to compared scores across cultures. Additionally many researchers using this scale have been modifying the scale, using only one subscale, and even scoring the measure differently. This project will determine if these different ways to interpret the scale will have a sizeable impact on the results of the statistical tests used. Since some researchers have been modifying the Dweck Mindset Instrument to focus on certain attitudes, this project will evaluate if that modifications can be valid using a mathematically focused mindset scale.

For example, in the field of genetics, a researcher might to try to detect the difference in gene expression between a cancer tumor and a nearby benign region. The difference between the two regions is the variation of interest--this is wanted variation. However, differences in genetic techniques between laboratories can create unwanted variation in the data, which can lead to the researcher reaching incorrect conclusions from the data. The unwanted variation can either induce bias, distorting the true relationship between the genes and diseases, or can decrease precision, masking the variation of interest. Ideally, the researcher would like to remove the unwanted variation. One way to achieve this goal is through a negative control, which is a variable that is associated with the unwanted variation, but is not associated with the variation of interest.  The goal of this project is to develop statistical techniques for using negative controls to effectively remove unwanted variation while keeping the variation of interest. These methods will be useful in a wide variety of fields, but will focus on genetics and causal inference, including experimental design.

Some universities, though, are building classrooms of the future that have highly flexible furniture and integrated technology. These innovative classrooms can be reconfigured for multiple uses, such as lecture-style teaching, having students work together in groups, and engaging in a whole-class discussion. People assume that these flexible classrooms automatically result in better teaching and learning, but there has been little research into their effect on faculty pedagogy and student behavior. During this project, five undergraduate engineering instructors at the University of Michigan will be supported as they transition from teaching in a traditional classroom to a new flexible classroom.  These instructors will be supported to learn about teaching practices that leverage the classroom flexibility and allow them to be more responsive to students. The impact of classroom flexibility on both faculty pedagogy and student behavior will be a key research focus of this project. Such research will generate evidence to inform the design of flexible classrooms, to support instructors using new pedagogies in these flexible classrooms, and ultimately to improve student learning and behavior.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will rigorously examine faculty pedagogy (including use of both active learning and responsive teaching, in which instructors elicit and respond to students' thinking) and student behavior in five undergraduate engineering courses. These courses will all be taught in a traditional lecture hall during the first year of the project and in a flexible classroom during the second year. Before and throughout the second year of the project, professional development will take place to support faculty in using the flexible classrooms. The research team will investigate changes in faculty pedagogy through a new classroom observation protocol that captures instances of active learning and responsive teaching, through instructor interviews that investigate how an instructor enacts responsive teaching, and through a survey for students to report their perceptions of responsive teaching. The research team will also examine students' interpretation (framing) of group learning activities by analyzing students' discourse during such activities in both the traditional and flexible classrooms. This project will further the nascent field of responsive teaching in engineering by providing future researchers with a standardized responsive teaching observation protocol. It will also provide engineering faculty, professional developers, and classroom designers with evidence-based ways to enact responsive teaching, implement group learning activities, and effectively design and use flexible classrooms."

Significant challenges must be overcome in designing a system architecture such that data intensive and/or latency sensitive applications can obtain the information that they need for peak performance. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has the potential to enable wireless efficiencies that are critical to support the strict guarantees desired by new applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) or the control of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs). The goal of this project is to design, develop and demonstrate SPLICE, a Secure Predictive Low-Latency Information-Centric Edge wireless network that will be able to provide information guarantees to these emerging applications. The project will also contribute to workforce development by means of curriculum development in this domain and recruitment of students from under-represented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>The proposed work is anchored in an ICN implementation called Named Data Networking (NDN), which will be able to effectively tie together application demands and wireless links. The research is organized into three inter-dependent thrusts: (i) Applications for an Information-Centric Wireless Edge: This thrust will define the performance criteria and determine the architecture of the focus application of the project: VR/AR. It will exploit multiple dimensions of commonality between instances of such applications through fast content caching and retrieval, and multicast services. (ii) ICN for the Wireless Edge: explore how information exchange via caching and markets would be accomplished, and how to design secure and privacy-preserving data transfer methods. A key novelty is the use of proactive secure caching that learns the value of applications and ensures they are cached ahead of demand. (iii) Wireless Communication for Information-Centric Networks: employ multicasting capabilities of wireless communication while simultaneously achieving low-delay guarantees and low-complexity feedback mechanisms, via a mix of coding, caching and scheduling techniques."

Both species are top predators on coral and rocky reefs throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans and are highly valued for artisanal, commercial, and sport fisheries. The research will investigate the correlation between genetic diversity and environmental variables (e.g., ocean temperature and currents) in the Indo-Pacific to identify physical barriers that might lead to observed differences in the genomes of these fishes in different geographic locations. The project focuses on the western Indian Ocean, a region lacking sufficient marine conservation measures in large part due to a scarcity of data necessary to inform governments making management decisions. Given the lack of data on these two species of Trevally, coupled with their economic importance, this project has direct societal implications. The researchers will share data with governmental and non-profit collaborators and incorporate strong scientific training components for graduate students, as well as engagement with members of the public in the USA, South Africa, and Seychelles. <br/>	<br/>To accomplish the project objectives, the researchers will first conduct seascape genetic analyses using next generation sequencing techniques, specifically double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine fine-scale genetic structure within and among C. ignobilis and C. melampygus individuals across their range. Seascape properties will be analyzed using coupled biological-physical models that integrate oceanographic data with biological attributes of these species. Models will be generated that maximize the availability of oceanographic information at a spatial scale complementary to the genetic data. The second component includes a phylogeographic analysis focused on characterizing patterns of historic gene flow by using paleoclimatic data to characterize physical and biological forces that may have driven evolution and influenced historical and present data distributions of the two species. This methodology uses high-resolution paleoceanographic models coupled with contemporary GIS-based species distribution modeling algorithms to generate paleodistribution suitability values for each species. These paleodistributions serve as alternate hypotheses to test against the SNP dataset. In combination, these analyses will provide insight on contemporary and historical processes shaping the diversification and connectivity of these two important fishery species."

Unfortunately, eye trackers have limited features and functionality, which need to be augmented to effectively study the behavior of software developers performing programming and contextual tasks. Eye tracking devices only allow scientists to study fixed, limited-size, stimuli (e.g., block of text or image). Studies normally require that the text fit on one screen (or page). There is very limited or no support to allow such things as scrolling through longer documents or switching back and forth between documents on a computer. While this is sufficient to study how people read one line of code or a sentence it is wholly inadequate to study how programmers attempt to comprehend or develop a large software system.<br/><br/>The objective of the research is to address this limitation and drastically expand the types and size of stimuli that can be studied using an eye tracking device. In addition to supporting source code artifacts, it also supports artifacts such as stack overflow documents, bug reports, testing documents, and requirements.This enables software engineering researchers to conduct large-scale realistic eye-tracking studies seamlessly within a software development environment.  This eye-tracking-enabled infrastructure for studying program comprehension has the potential to transform the way lab studies and field studies are designed and executed as it advances the state of the art in conducting eye tracking studies in software engineering.  The infrastructure directly impacts society by paving the way to further improve IDEs to support the developer in various software engineering tasks through the various research projects it facilitates. The immediate impact is to facilitate controlled laboratory and field environments for a community of researchers. The research may lead to software development tools that incorporate eye-tracking as part of a more productive programming environment leading to higher quality software."

Using various computer models we can observe if Venus has undergone a climate change in recent history. Studying climate change is fundamental in explaining Venus as it is today. Understanding the climate will constrain the atmospheric composition in the near surface environment, illuminate the possible weather patterns that can exist on Venus, and possibly determine the origin of the low emissivity metal frost on the mountain tops. Venus and Earth were once identical planets of similar origin, atmosphere, and geology. By understanding the Venusian atmosphere it may help us figure out how and why Earth and Venus diverged from one another and assist us in better understanding planetary formation. Venus' atmosphere is comprised of 97% CO2 and so is a perfect example of the effects of runaway greenhouse effect, a problem currently plaguing our planet. If we can determine why Venus is so hot and how high concentrations of CO2 can affect the surface conditions, we can learn more about climate change on Earth. <br/><br/>Using global circulation, radiative heat transfer, and chemical composition at equilibrium models we can observe if Venus has undergone a recent climate change that could account for the metal frost in the mountain tops. Using the codes we will alter the temperature of the atmosphere, for example by injecting hot or cold air into the circulation model to see how it will disburse around Venus and affect the temperature of the surface. This change in temperature may modify the formation and composition of clouds and precipitates. From there we can study possible interactions between the atmosphere and the surface. In order to study this the PI will work under the mentorship of Dr. George Hashimoto of Okayama University to develop a code together to model surface-atmosphere chemical reactions. Using the Japanese Space Agency's orbiter, Akatsuki, we can use the IR1 camera to study the surface at various levels and compare the surface emissivities with our results to see if the minerals are the same. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Prior research demonstrates that high motivation and positive attitudes towards learning occur when students feel in control of their own learning, place a high value on what they are studying, can regulate their anxiety, and recover from setbacks.  While asking students questions about these issues is useful, there is a more direct way to study them - by measuring students' physical responses in real time. A unique element of this study is that in addition to surveys, the investigators will monitor students' body stress responses through sweat and saliva to capture students' anxiety during an exam. The intellectual merit of this ECR project is to broaden understanding of factors related to success using physical signs that a student cannot consciously control and of which they may not even be aware. The broader impacts of this research will come from integrating students' reported perceptions with their unconscious responses to better understand students' emotional and motivational responses to learning, especially those of underrepresented students, who face even greater challenges.

In addition to surveys, we will use physiological markers based on sweat on the skin (electrodermal activity) and saliva (particularly hormonal markers) to capture students' emotion and anxiety during an authentic exam setting associated with a foundational engineering course. The project will also be integrative in drawing upon theoretical and practical knowledge from engineering education, psychology, physiology, and the learning sciences. It will also broaden understanding of factors related to student emotion, motivation and self-regulation using physical signals that a student cannot self-report as they cannot consciously control and may not even be aware of.

In both nature, and in industry, iron nitrides play a fleeting but critical role in capturing nitrogen from the air that we breathe and transferring it to important species (such as fertilizers for crop growth) ? a process known as nitrogen fixation. Despite the importance of iron nitrides in the global nitrogen fixation cycle (and in the marketplace), the study of molecules possessing individual iron nitride units has been hampered by the lack of model complexes.  This project is developing new molecular architectures to access, trap, and study reactive iron nitride compounds.  The goals are to shed light on the steps of the nitrogen fixation cycle and to use lessons learned to develop important, new nitrogen complexes using earth-abundant iron. Importantly, this chemistry utilizes iron which is a sustainable, non-toxic metal ? avoiding the need for costly and toxic precious metals.  This project provides research opportunities for early-career scientists, including students from historically underrepresented groups. UTEP is a minority serving institution with an 80% Hispanic student population. The training and development the students receive is critically important for preparing the next generation of domestic science and technology personnel capable of competing in the global marketplace. On top of this, in an effort to encourage an active role in their learning, a student-directed seminar involves students in the hosting and organization of departmental seminars twice per semester. This program includes an ?Ask Me Anything? interview session where the students can learn from the life and professional experiences of the guest speaker as a professional development exercise and to reinforce resiliency and fortitude as traits for success. <br/><br/>This project involves the use of ""super bulky"" guanidinate ligands to kinetically stabilize reactive iron-nitride compounds and delves into the factors that affect iron nitride reactivity. Using redox chemistry and ligand modifications, structure-function relationships are examined as they pertain to the electronics and chemical behavior of the iron-nitride moiety. A goal is to modulate the reactivity of the iron-nitride unit through ligand field effects, effectively using the ligand as a ""chemical remote control"" to influence the nucleophilicity/electrophilicity of the nitride group.  A new professional development program at UTEP was initiated to better prepares the next generation of science and technology personnel.

One non-tectonic deformation source, particularly important for vertical GPS time series, is seasonal changes in elastic loading. For example, this can occur when water reservoirs annually cycle between empty and full. If the contributions of water loading to the GPS time series can be modeled and understood, it is possible to make timely, accurate, and locally useful estimates of surface water storage simply from GPS measurements. To that end, this study aims to identify the components of surface water loads in the continuous GPS measurements from Myanmar. The vertical GPS signals in this dataset are known to contain some of the largest annual oscillations in the world, likely due to the Asian Monsoon. However, the degree to which changes in surface water storage can explain the GPS oscillations remains unknown. This work will be completed with Professor Emma Hill, a leading researcher in GPS geodesy at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. This research will also benefit from collaboration with the many researchers in Dr. Hill's research group who are working on a large-scale study of geodetic data from Myanmar. <br/><br/>This project will decompose the GPS time series into components from elastic loading and other sources through a loading model. Gravity measurements from the GRACE satellite mission will be used to constrain surface water loads. The elastic deformation will then be modeled for each GPS station using a reference earth structure. It is hypothesized that much of the seasonal variation in the vertical GPS time series, which can reach 5 cm/year in amplitude, is due to hydrologic loading. This project will produce a specific model of the seasonal loading effects on the deformation field. The correlations between the GPS and GRACE time series should also provide locally specific estimates of water storage levels at each continuous GPS station in Myanmar. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

To date, the PI has implemented, tested and characterized radar and ultrasonic secondary sensors as sources of motion compensation correction signals. This approach compensates the vertical motion, however, horizontal motion compensation techniques are also required to maximize the Signal to Noise Ratio.

The Asian American population has grown from 1 percent to 6 percent in the last half-century, and Asian Americans play an increasingly important role in the U.S. labor market and in American society. Asian Americans have relatively high wages and levels of college attainment, but are also underrepresented in upper-level management positions, and have relatively high poverty rates. To better understand these patterns, the researchers study perceptions of Asian Americans, particularly whether Asian Americans tend to be perceived as technically competent, but lacking in social skills, and if so, how these perceptions affect their labor market outcomes. The project makes two major contributions. First, the study uses a range of methods to overcome the limitations of any single approach, including surveys that measure perceptions of Asian Americans, field studies examining hiring behavior by actual employers, and analysis of large-scale nationally-representative labor market data. Second, the study examines a broader group of Asian Americans than past research, looking at variation by nativity, ethnicity, sex, and income level. More broadly, the work provides insight into factors that shape Asian Americans' economic outcomes and will be of use to policymakers and employers. This research also contributes to training undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Prior research on labor market outcomes of Asian Americans focuses on factors such as educational attainment, place of education, and local labor market conditions. The researchers build on this work by examining perceptions of Asian Americans and the consequences of these perceptions for labor market outcomes. Past work finds that Asians are perceived as technically competent, but not sociable or dominant. Much of this work focuses on men in professional occupations. The researchers extend these studies by investigating views of men and women in high and low-income jobs. The researchers will use survey experiments to measure labor market-relevant perceptions of Asian Americans, and will do so for men and women of different ethnicities and nativities, in both high and low-income jobs. Second, the researchers will conduct field studies comparing hiring outcomes of Asian Americans and other groups in jobs that require competence or sociability. Third, the researchers will use nationally representative labor market data to examine wages of Asian Americans in occupations that require skills that they are perceived to lack. We will use individual-level data drawn from the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey, and occupation-level data drawn from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). By combining survey experiments, field studies, and nationally representative labor market data, we capitalize on the complementary strengths of these three methods: the ability of survey experiments to support causal inference across diverse groups, the ability of field experiments to offer a real-world measure of hiring, and the representativeness of the survey data. This allows us to test the internal and external validity of our hypotheses."

Faculty frequently struggle to understand and help students master this skill, thus there is a need to explore and characterize how students engage in this skill and to determine whether problem-solving errors are primarily based on a lack of content or science skills knowledge, or on a misunderstanding about how to approach problem-solving.  This project will combine an exploration of what students are thinking as they solve problems with analysis of their performance on the same questions.  The project will also measure students' ability to reflect on how they solve problems, as well as determine whether student perception of the difficulty of a problem affects their ability to solve it.  A better understanding of how students think about solving a problem, and the errors that they make as they solve problems, will then serve as a basis for developing strategies and practice tools to improve students' problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>This project has two major objectives: 1) to systematically examine and compare students' cognitive processes in solving complex problems that are either content-focused or skills-focused and 2) to develop multiple kinds of validated problem-solving practice tools.  The project approaches understanding students' problem-solving processes by combining a detailed qualitative exploration of their cognitive reasoning with a quantitative analysis of how specific kinds of guidance may assist in their process.  Additionally, students' ability to regulate their thinking process (i.e. metacognition), as well as their perception of the mental effort required to solve problems, will be measured and related to problem-solving ability.   A better understanding of students' patterns of thinking and the errors they make will then serve as a foundation to independently test guidance in three areas - content, skills, and problem-solving processes.  The utility of combining and repeating this guidance can be tested, along with the contribution of mental effort and metacognition.  A detailed regression model will be built using the quantitative data collected to determine whether guidance improves performance.  This project will also provide detailed insight into student thinking while problem-solving, and will relate these patterns to performance and improvement.  Ultimately, the project will deliver these insights along with successful tools for helping students improve their problem-solving ability.  Although this project is centered on solving problems in biology and life science, learning how to solve problems has long-term benefits for all college students, therefore these findings are likely to be broadly applicable to educators and students in a variety of STEM disciplines."

This project will therefore work to create and measure cost-effective III-V solar cells for their performance and behavior in normal operating conditions such as: different humidity levels, high and low temperatures, and varying light exposure. The research will be done in collaboration with Dr. Martial Ducamp, an expert in in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Singapore. The results of the study will identify possible causes of lower efficiencies in low-cost III-V solar cells, which will in turn make it possible to improve the manufacturing procedures used to produce lower cost, higher efficiency solar cells.<br/><br/>The relationship between material properties and electrical performance will be tested using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with electron beam induced current (EBIC). TEM observes inter-atomic interactions and bonds, while, simultaneously, EBIC measures localized carrier collection throughout the sample. By correlating the TEM images with EBIC signal, certain structures, arrangements or bonds can be identified as resulting in good or bad performance. The project will also evaluate TEM/EBIC correlations under device operating conditions to identify weakly performing regions and potential causes that arise due to real, environmental factors. With a greater understanding of the causes of these low-performing regions, it will be possible to iterate making improvements to the III-V growth process until devices can be manufactured that are optimized both for cost and efficiency. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

Populations that dispersed to Hokkaido from a southern refugium are expected to tolerate greater higher temperature and to salinity fluctuations, whereas populations originating from deeper water are expected to show lower tolerance for fluctuations in temperature and salinity. Additionally, the researcher will be collecting specimens of M. senile throughout their northern range in Japan for molecular analysis, which, when compared with others throughout the Pacific, will indicate as to whether Japan served as a refugium for the Northern Pacific. These data will be applied to a wider study on the North Atlantic and Pacific phylogeography of M. senile to examine how distributional changes have proceeded and shifted as a response to atmospheric changes and inform how they might respond to future shifting climate conditions.

The prospect of substantial and sometimes unexpected changes in economic, social, or foreign policy stimulates heated debate and strong emotions in the public. This evolving context allows for scholars to assess how emotion regulation shapes political behavior and attitudes. The activation of emotion in the face of unexpected events may manifest in a number of forms: posting on social media, attending town hall meetings, contacting elected officials, signing petitions, and/or participating in social movements. This knowledge helps to explain when and why emotions fuel broad-scale political participation and competition. The data generated from this project enables the investigators to assess theories about the influence of emotion regulation on political participation, i.e. how different types of emotion regulation strategies lead to different types of political behavior.  The project will also provide valuable data for the social science community more broadly.  In particular, the study will produce the first multi-wave panel survey tracking how individual attitudes and behavior change over time in response to political events during the first year of a party transition in the United States. The survey is the first in political science to study how emotion regulation habits vary across individuals in society and considers whether, over time, these habits lead to more consensus or greater polarization. The study utilizes established practices from psychology to measure emotion regulation habits in political contexts. The project also trains graduate and undergraduate students in machine learning, automated text coding, and text-analytics of open-ended survey responses. These are emerging as critical skills in the field of survey research as computing power opens new opportunities for understanding public attitudes through more free-form, naturalistic responses compared to traditional surveys. <br/><br/>Scientific Merit<br/>This study contributes to a growing body of research exploring the importance of socio-political emotions in fueling public attitudes and behavior. We develop new theory to explain how individual-level emotion regulation habits a) moderate the affective processing of information and b) influence expressive and social political behavior. Pilot tests indicate individuals adept at regulating their emotions through reappraising emotion-provoking stimuli were more likely to become politically active compared to those who use suppressive or avoidance regulation habits. Reappraisers are more likely to transmit their views to others, thus serving as a source of social contagion. This project uses a three-wave panel survey design to conduct a broader test of how emotion regulation shapes issue engagement, changes in perceptions of political responsibility, and changes in levels and forms of political participation. We draw our panel sample from a pool of respondents to a large online national survey conducted just prior to the 2016 elections to obtain pre-election baseline opinions on key policy topics like healthcare, the environment, tax reform, and military use. Subsequent waves of the panel study are timed to survey respondents during critical moments of policy change, or will follow an unexpected extraordinary event, should one arise. The design permits the investigators to observe individual-level change in the use of emotion regulation habits over time, and to test whether different emotion regulation habits make individuals more prone to reexamine their beliefs. If that is the case, these individuals could potentially change beliefs, or reject new information and maintain rigidity in attitudes. The research also allows the investigators to examine how emotion regulation influences or hinders political activism in response to emotionally provocative moments in society."

The scientific impacts of this research derive from our across-the-board interest in the fundamental interactions between light and matter, the emergent behaviors that are unveiled when materials are driven away from ambient conditions, and the new states of matter that emerge when phases compete. This work builds on prior experience with low temperature, high magnetic field, and  high pressure spectroscopy, and it leverages the facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. At the same time, planned activities support the interdisciplinary education of a diverse group of young researchers for future employment in academics, government laboratories, and industry in the area of advanced materials. A broad range of outreach and service activities are planned, especially in the area of conference and workshop organization and service to various national laboratories. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>This project focuses on the spectroscopic properties of molecule-based materials and how external stimuli like magnetic field and pressure impact functionality. Building on key advances of the previous award period, current efforts concentrate on phase transitions in model quantum magnets and hybrid multiferroics and the structure-property relationships that can be unraveled in these systems. Within this broad scientific area, several materials have been selected that are expected to show large or widely applicable effects and where the analysis of the spectroscopic response can reveal the microscopic aspects of coupling between charge, structure, and magnetism. What brings these efforts together is an overarching interest in the behavior of materials under extreme conditions and the spectroscopic techniques with which these phenomena are investigated. Findings from this comprehensive experimental program will advance both theoretical understanding and the design of new materials."

When the titanium dioxide particle size is on the order of 0.00000005 inches, TiO2 exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, a chemical phenomenon in which the TiO2 increases the efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes by providing alternative reaction pathways.  In recent years, the low cost and non-toxic properties of titanium dioxide nanocatalysts have led to their commercialization for solar water purification in third-world countries, for flexible solar cells fabricated by roll-to-roll printing, and for self-cleaning building materials. While chemists have long known that the reactivity of these nanocrystals depends critically on their shape and structure, there is little fundamental understanding of these dependencies and thus no rational means for improving their performance. In this research project, Prof. Melissa Hines and her graduate students at Cornell University are using atomic-scale microscopy to study the structure and reactivity of a variety of small molecules during their interaction with titanium dioxide surfaces. Using insights gained from these experiments, she and her students are developing new methods to improve the performance of these crystals, including the growth of surface-supported, nanoscale networks. The fundamental understanding gained from these experiments will help future applications, such as new types of batteries or solar cells with improved performance. To share their enthusiasm about science with school children, she and her group are developing hands-on science lessons for middle school students, visiting schools to perform these experiments, and contributing these lessons to an online lending library of science experiments for teachers nationwide.<br/><br/>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Melissa A. Hines of Cornell University and her students are using solution-based chemical reactions and surface science techniques to produce the fundamental understanding necessary for the development of sustainable, non-toxic, earth-abundant nanocatalysts, photocatalysts, photovoltaic devices, and energy-storage materials. The research uses solution-deposited, self-assembled monolayers of molecular exemplars to study the atomic-scale structure of seven of the most commonly used organic linkages to metal oxide surfaces. These monolayers are deposited on the surfaces of well-controlled rutile (110) single crystals and epitaxial anatase (001) films and studied with a combination of experimental and computational techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy, infrared and x-ray photoemission spectroscopies, and first-principles modeling. This research is producing the understanding necessary for the rational development of high strength and/or high conductivity organic coatings on metal oxide nanocatalysts and thin films, while also developing the high quality self-assembled monolayers necessary for electronic characterization of molecule-titanium dioxide linkages. The organic linkage chemistries are being explored for use in a new class of surface-supported, highly porous, conducting nanoscale networks. Coupled with this research, Hines and her group are developing new hands-on science experiments that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards and suitable for the middle school classroom. The group field tests these activities in K-12 classrooms and through teacher development programs.

The broader impacts of the project include: 1) the practical applications of widely available language translation technology, and 2) the training of graduate engineers who have specialization in machine learning as well as hardware and circuit design, skills in broad demand in US industry.<br/><br/>The problem of developing hardware to fit deep learning models is not simply one of fitting current machine learning models on current circuit technology, as the models are much too large, too slow, and too energy-hungry. This project will need to develop novel machine learning techniques that take these factors into account. Machine learning researchers mostly optimize for accuracy; however, the project goal will require considering trade-offs on model size, speed, and computation. Conversely, the hardware design will have to consider and exploit the unique properties of the neural models, such as high-tolerance to certain types of noise, repeated computational structure, and non-linear interactions. The research approach includes three major areas for interaction: model compression, approximation in architecture, and training for unreliable hardware. Succeeding in these goals will be necessary to build a successful on-device system."

However, drawbacks such as low transfection efficiency and size related cytotoxicity limiting full usage of these systems. In this research, responsive, cationic polypeptoid copolymers will be developed. Under the guidance of Professor Lichen Yin, an expert in cell transfection at Soochow University, synthesized copolymers will be used to investigate the particle stability and behavior of nucleic acid condensed polyplexes during in vitro cell transfection. This research will provide a strategy to stabilize genetic material during cell transfection. This approach will also permit the effective release genetic material intracellularly via endosomal escape.<br/><br/>Poly(N-substituted glycines) are a special class of peptidomimetic polymers bearing substituents on the nitrogen present in the backbone. Commonly referred to as polypeptoids, this group of polymers are known for their minimal cytotoxicity, enhanced proteolytic stability and structural tunability, making them potential candidates for a variety of biomedical and biotechnological applications including smart-coatings, antimicrobial agents, and drug delivery. Currently, the cell transfection of polypeptoid/DNA complexes in serum-containing media is problematic due to the instability of the complexed particles in serum. The manifestation of charge shielding, in which interaction with anionic serum components (lipids, albumin, salts, etc.) reduces polyplex surface charge, is mainly responsible for this outcome. To address this challenge, block polypeptoid copolymers containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments will be developed in this project. In this research synthesized copolymers will be tested for their ability to effectively protect and transport therapeutic gene p53 during in vitro cell transfection in nuclease. Under extracellular conditions where charge shielding is permissible (pH= 5.0-5.5), it is anticipated that copolymers will respond to this biological stimuli by adopting a micellar structure with a charged, hydrophobic inner core and charge neutral outer shell. Dr. Yin's group proficiency in the field of cell transfection will contribute significantly towards efforts to understand and elucidate the behavior of these polymeric systems in biological environments. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Proteins are the workhorses of all living systems.  Their functions are regulated by diverse modifications of protein structures.  Identifying and understanding these modifications can benefit many areas of research, including such diverse work as probing the chemical mechanisms of life, energy production, and environmental remediation. The Zhong group seeks to enhance this knowledge by developing selective recognition tools that can accurately assess changes in protein modification in response to external stimulation of living cells. Specifically, they are developing a series of sensors for specific types of protein modification. The recognition element is a judiciously designed molecule that acts like a lock's ""keyhole,"" fitting only a correctly sized ""key"" - the right type of modification on a protein. Inserting the ""key"" into the ""lock"" generates a large optical signal, allowing simple and rapid detection of protein modifications. The work targets improved understanding of protein modification, thereby advancing strategies for controlling processes in living systems. In addition to these technical impacts, the work is enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce via engagement of both graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The Zhong group is developing synthetic receptor-based arrays for detection of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteins. Selective host-guest interactions between modified side chains and synthetic receptors (cavitands) allows highly selective recognition of modified proteins, and can discriminate for example among proteins with different methylation levels, sites, and numbers. The technique will be valuable in rapid profiling of methylation alterations in cells under external stimulation and in situ monitoring of PTM enzyme activities. Initial targets include hosts that bind selectively to trimethylated lysine, with an aim of enabling array-based PTM profiling. Cavitand hosts are being synthesized and used in fluorescence displacement assays (FDA) for selective detection and discrimination of PTM peptides. Characterization of cavitand-guest interactions will enhance understanding of how cavitand structures affect binding strength and kinetics, supporting new designs with improved FDA performance. In a specific model application, cavitand-based arrays are being applied to study histone methylation in stimulated cells. It is expected that the highly selective and versatile PTM sensing arrays enabled by cavitands can greatly improve the detection of peptides carrying modifications, and enhance the efficacy of PTM study. Discovery of hosts with high affinity and selectivity for diverse PTM types will boost understanding of PTM functions."

Three different types of neutrino are known to exist, having been detected through their interaction via one of the known forces of nature.  A fourth type of neutrino has been postulated, a so-called light sterile neutrino, that is presumed to only interact via gravity.  Persistent, unproven hints of such a neutrino have been around since the late 1990's, when some accelerator data were shown to be incompatible with the 3-neutrino framework of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. More recent results and re-analyses of older data continue to suggest the existence of this type of new physics, but no experiment has been able to definitively demonstrate or rule out their existence. Going forward, reactor neutrinos offer a promising means to resolve the cluster of anomalies commonly attributed to a light sterile neutrino. One hint of particular relevance is the so-called reactor neutrino anomaly whereby all reactor experiments find a deficit in the neutrino interaction probability when compared to calculations of the reactor neutrino flux. <br/><br/>Technologies for reactor neutrino detection may have applications beyond basic science. It has been pointed out that a high-efficiency detector with good energy resolution could determine the plutonium content of a reactor in situ. Such a capability could be used to evaluate new reactor designs, or as a part of a verification scheme for nuclear non-proliferation. A real-world application to non-proliferation safeguards will require a detector technology which can operate at the surface, in close proximity to a reactor, with minimal shielding and without hazardous liquids. The CHANDLER technology was conceived with these requirements in mind. The CHANDLER project will continue to be an excellent training ground for young scientists. This project also involves two high school teachers through the QuarkNET program.<br/><br/>The discovery of a light sterile neutrino would be truly transformative to the field of particle physics, while a thorough debunking of the ~1 eV sterile neutrino hypothesis would simplify interpretations of future long-baseline experiments. This EAGER award provides funding to perform a full systems test of a new reactor neutrino detector technology, known as CHANDLER, by deploying the 80 channel, 80 kg MiniCHANDLER prototype, at the North Anna Nuclear Power Plant. The goal of this deployment is to evaluate the detector's performance. In particular, it will determine whether MiniCHANDLER can adequately isolate reactor neutrino events from the background, and whether this technology is capable of the high precision spectral measurement required to definitively discover or rule out the sterile neutrino hypothesis. A successful demonstration will prove the suitability of this technology for a full-scale short-baseline neutrino oscillation search."

Looking at linguistic systems across the ~6,000 languages currently spoken reveals numerous differences, but also many similarities. The field of linguistics is concerned with describing the possible and impossible systems that exist in the world's languages, providing a window into human cognition. The speech of typical and disordered children is a rich domain for exploring what linguistic systems tell us about the human mind, as they show us how these systems develop and how they can break down. In turn, understanding the formal mechanics of linguistic systems is useful to developing effective interventions for children and adults exhibiting speech disorders.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the current workshop is to open up intellectual dialogue between the fields of phonology (a sub-field of linguistics) and communication disorders and to broaden the prospects for academic employment for current graduate students. The workshop is integrated with the Annual Meeting on Phonology 2017, which is being hosted at New York University jointly between the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders. The conference regularly draws a large group of phonologists together, and the workshop will encourage participation and visibility for related research in speech disorders. The workshop consists of (i) an invited talk by Adam Buchwald (NYU), (ii) a session of talks and posters related to speech disorders and phonology, (iii) a tutorial on ultrasound imaging and biofeedback by Doug Whalen (The Graduate Center, CUNY), (iv) a panel discussion and mixer for graduate students on research and career paths at the interface between linguistics and speech disorders. The workshop activities are integrated into the regular schedule of the conference, to encourage the attendance of all participants in the conference. This choice will maximize the impact of the workshop and emphasize that clinical data can be of interest to all phonologists."

This project will travel to the central Andes of South America- a region that is both politically fragile and recently drought stricken. The aim is to study the interplay of temperature and drought in the past, for clues to their probable connections in the future. <br/><br/>The main purpose of the project is to create a map of changes in the sizes of ancient lakes in the central Andes, giant ancestors to modern lakes in the region such as Lake Titicaca. Well-preserved shorelines mark the extent of these ancient lakes, and using state-of-the art techniques, the age of these features can be determined. The mapping and dating is vital to relating lake size (and therefore rainfall amounts in the past) to the changing temperature state of the planet, which is well known from other records.  In short, these reconstructions will help scientists to better understand how rainfall in this region will change in the coming decades to centuries.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Currently, chemicals commonly used to disinfect wastewater, such as chlorine, can react with other molecules in the water to create potentially harmful disinfection byproducts (DBPs). New technologies using ultraviolet (UV) light and semiconducting materials may be a byproduct-free alternative to chemical disinfection to inactivate pathogenic bacteria. However, solar light has less than 5% UV light radiation and artificial source of UV-light makes UV technology expensive. This project will test the disinfecting capabilities of visible light active iron-containing silicate glass. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shiro Kubuki, of Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU) in Tokyo, Japan, who has developed an iron-containing silicate glass that can be easily activated by visible light. This specific type of glass can be prepared from recycled glass bottles, and uses visible light, rather than UV-light, making it a cost-effective, byproduct-free alternative to chemical disinfection. <br/><br/>Although it has been established that some semiconductors, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), can effectively inactivate pathogenic bacteria, they require ultra-violet (UV) light to be effective.

By coordinating hundreds of moving parts, their five arms work together to permit rapid motion across the complex terrain of the sea floor. They lack a front and back, allowing them to move in every direction equally without the need to turn. When one or several arms become damaged or lost, they readjust their locomotion to compensate without any loss of movement capability. These characteristics alone make brittle stars ideal candidates for robotic imitation, yet their most striking feature is that they intercept external stimuli, make decisions, and coordinate multiple moving parts, all without a brain! Many mobile robots similarly do not rely on a single control center, although those in robots are far less complex and resilient than the biological machinery employed by brittle stars. This investigation will analyze how the brittle star nervous system controls its locomotion and engineer a robot to test the results. Thus the two major goals of the project are: 1. To determine how the brittle star nervous system works and 2. To work out how to integrate this setup into a multifaceted robotic device. <br/><br/>Professor Akio Ishiguro and his research group at Tohoku University have engineered a variety of robots with coordinated behavior operating under decentralized control.

This investigation will test hypotheses of sensory processing, action determination, and task delegation with a combination of experiments on live ophiuroids and mathematical and robotic modeling. This will result in a mathematical model describing the brittle star system that can be integrated into a robotic device to evaluate its accuracy and improve coordination in complex robots.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Pharmaceuticals that are in the molecularly-disordered, or amorphous, state are advantageous compared to molecularly-ordered, or crystalline, forms of the same drug because the amorphous material has higher solubility in water and higher bioavailability. Consequently, lower doses can be used, decreasing both cost and the probability of toxic side effects.  However, amorphous pharmaceuticals are generally not stable and can crystallize, albeit slowly, from the amorphous state.  The aim of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research project is to gain a fundamental understanding of crystallization from the amorphous state and to develop new processing strategies to make stable forms of amorphous pharmaceuticals. The results are anticipated to facilitate development of new amorphous drug formulations and to, thus, benefit the U.S. economy and society.

The collaboration with the industrial partner will ensure commercial consideration and provide a unique and broad-perspective training opportunity for the students.    <br/><br/>Fundamental knowledge related to amorphous pharmaceuticals will be pursued in this project.

The research is based on the hypothesis that one can create more stable amorphous pharmaceutical glasses if the nucleation nose of the diagram and the crystallization nose are both avoided, with the former occurring at shorter times.  Flash scanning calorimetry will facilitate exploration of a wide range of very high cooling rates or short isothermal crystallization/nucleation times in order to establish the bounds of the potential for making specific compounds into stable glasses. Spray drying, vapor deposition, and melt extrusion methods will also be investigated as processing paths to create stable glassy pharmaceuticals. Crystallization kinetics from the glassy state will be studied by calorimetry, and the relationship to glassy dynamics, as obtained from dielectric spectroscopy and viscoelastic methods, will be established."

Traditionally, liquid electrolytes have been used in these applications due to their high ionic conductivity, but because they are prone to flammability and leakage, it is crucial to find a safer alternative. This study will investigate the structure and conductive properties of polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) as mechanically robust alternatives to liquid electrolytes. This research will be conducted at Osaka University in Japan with Dr. Tadashi Inoue, a world-leading expert in polymer dynamics. <br/><br/>Polymerized ionic liquids (PILs) are defined as single ion conducting ionomers, in which one of the ionic species is incorporated in the polymer chain while the other is nominally free to transport. Although they are a safer, mechanically stable alternative to traditional liquid electrolytes, the challenge that remains is increasing the low ion transport rates inherent to polymeric materials. Utilizing smaller ionic charge carriers should increase the conductivity of the material and by varying the size of the charge carrier, greater insight on the relationship between conductivity and structure can be obtained. Because changing the material architecture will change the segmental motion of the polymer chain, Dr. Tadashi Inoue's expertise in polymer dynamics will greatly aid in understanding the fundamental relationship between structure, mobility, and polymer chain relaxation. The results of this study will make a positive contribution to the current understanding of polymer conductivity for the design of safer and more efficient electrolytic materials. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

These virtues derive from the large fraction of material that resides at the interfaces between neighboring crystals, known as grain boundaries. For these materials, this high fraction of interfacial volume can cause deleterious effects such as thermal instability and relatively poor damage tolerance.  Many present and future applications of nanocrystalline metals such as robust coatings, electrical interconnects, micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems, and soft magnets subject these materials to extreme mechanical duress, which can activate microstructural transformation and alter the beneficial materials properties. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports research centered on the concept that control of grain boundary chemistry in nanocrystalline alloys can be used to tailor the thermal and mechanical stability of nanocrystalline materials against grain boundary migration in extreme service environments. Control over this behavior can allow for unprecedented control of damage tolerance, thus enabling a novel and inexpensive structural materials design strategy.<br/><br/>In this research program, the investigators aim to control grain boundary chemistry in nanocrystalline alloys as a means to encode the onset of thermally- and mechanically-driven grain boundary migration under service conditions. In cases where extreme mechanical environments are encountered (e.g. at stress concentrations such as crack tips), stress-driven grain boundary migration can be triggered to respond to damage, endowing the material with damage tolerance. This dynamic material response is predicated on local stress triggers that drive microstructure transition and dissipate energy to mitigate catastrophic failure, allowing for both strength and toughness. The research will be accomplished via the following scientific and technical goals: (a) identify and characterize the mechanisms that lead to mechanically-induced grain boundary migration and grain growth, (b) identify and characterize the manner in which these mechanisms are influenced by grain boundary chemistry, (c) identify elements that will segregate to grain boundary and modulate thermal and stress-driven grain boundary migration, (d) synthesize nanocrystalline alloys with tailored grain boundary chemistry, and (e) perform material characterization and quantitative in situ mechanical testing."

The developed technology aims to improve treatment of atrial fibrillation, which has an estimated the prevalence of 2.7-6.1 million in the United States, with 200,000 new cases annually.  The developed real-time, magnetic resonance, imaging-guided, robotic catheter technology will significantly improve the accuracy and repeatability of the atrial fibrillation ablation therapy, compared to the state-of-the-art manually controlled catheters.  This technology will also reduce costs by decreasing time in the operating room, reducing the need for repeat procedures due to incomplete treatment, and reducing adverse events and complications.  In this project, the investigators will develop a proof-of-concept prototype of the robotic catheter system that will be used in subsequent early validation studies.<br/><br/>This project addresses the technology gaps in synergistically integrating high-speed magnetic resonance imaging technologies with robotic motion planning and control techniques, to develop a novel co-robotic system.  In the proposed paradigm, the atrial fibrillation ablation will be performed under intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and conventional manually controlled intravascular catheters will be replaced with robotic catheters actuated by the magnetic resonance imaging system. The location of the catheter tip and the target tissue will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging in real-time. The robotic control algorithms will then use this information to actively control the catheter tip. Intra-operative availability of magnetic resonance imaging, with its superior tissue discrimination capabilities, would allow real-time evaluation of the substrate depth and lesion created by ablation. <br/><br/>In addition, personnel involved in this project, in particular, one postdoctoral and one graduate student, will receive training in innovation and technology commercialization through participating in technology innovation and entrepreneurship education programs."

Formally, a group is simply a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies two axioms formalizing the concept of undoing the operation. Mathematicians are concerned both with the overarching abstract algebraic structures that arise from these rules, and with concrete examples that have natural significance, such as the set of rigid motions of the plane, the configurations of a Rubik's cube, or the symmetries of a polyhedron. Here free groups, which have a particularly simple algebraic structure in which there is the minimal possible cancellation, play an essential role as building blocks from which many other groups are built. Free group extensions are a basic example of this sort of construction. Yet, despite being built from well-understood pieces, free group extensions remain rather mysterious. This project will investigate dynamical, algebraic, and geometric aspects of free group extensions and combine these perspectives to illuminate the broad structure of these groups. This expands on the investigator's prior work with collaborators exploring and relating the different ways a given group may be built as a free-by-cyclic group, as well as work on the coarse negative curvature of certain free group extensions.<br/><br/>This project will focus on aspects of geometry, topology, algebra, and dynamics in the context of free group automorphisms and surface homeomorphisms. The investigator will continue his work with collaborators analyzing splittings of free-by-cyclic groups via the dynamics of certain semi-flows on 2-complexes. A main goal is to tie together all the monodromies of the different splittings via a uniformized action of the entire group on a tree and to use this to define canonical algebraic invariants and relate all the Cannon-Thurston maps to each other. In addition to strengthening these connections, the project will work to prove that the property of having a fully irreducible monodromy is shared by either all or none of the splittings of the group. Continuing his work with a collaborator, the investigator will study the geometry of general free group extensions and work to characterize Gromov hyperbolicity and establish rigidity results for this class of groups. With regard to the study of surface homeomorphisms, the investigator will work with collaborators to show that all small-dilatation pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms have the simple structure predicted by the symmetry conjecture. Finally, the investigator will study large-scale geometric and dynamical properties of the Teichmuller space of a surface with an aim towards calculating expected thinness of triangles and lattice point asymptotics for natural sets of surface homeomorphisms."

Scholars make comparisons across time and place to better understand a wide range of political and social phenomena. One of the central techniques that social scientists often use is the controlled comparison, whereby scholars hold potential explanatory factors constant across different cases to help them assess their contribution to particular outcomes.  This approach has been central to some of the most influential works of social science. It has helped scholars explain everything from why some countries are rich and some are poor to why some countries are democratic and some are authoritarian. Yet even as controlled comparisons have produced lasting insights, they are not the only form of comparison that scholars utilize to answer important questions about social and political life. There is little guidance, however, on how to develop and execute comparisons that do not rely on the controlled case model, and what types of insights alternative comparison models can offer. The goal of this project is to lay out just such guidelines. To do so, this project will explore two of the most fundamental questions in the study of politics: (1) how and why scholars decide on what they compare, and (2) how the methodological assumptions scholars make about why and how they compare shape the knowledge they produce. By answering these questions, the project will create new resources for future students and researchers to draw upon in their efforts to advance knowledge.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project aims to reimagine three central components of the comparative method in order to develop new logics for comparative research designs that move beyond traditional controlled comparison designs. First, it will encourage political scientists to think critically about what a case is by challenging dominant norms and encouraging scholars to think of processes, practices, meanings, and concepts as cases to be compared. Second, the project will expand the notion of what it means to compare. It aims to push scholars to conceptualize comparison as a method that includes approaches beyond controlled comparison, including greater attention to the experiences of subjects being studied and the ways those experiences re-order social worlds. Finally, the project proposes to expand the explanatory goals of comparative research by de-emphasizing variations in outcomes and opening up variations in political processes, meanings, and concepts as similarities or differences to be explained. To achieve these goals, this project will convene a workshop on comparative methods, and produce an edited volume based on contributions emerging from the workshop that will serve as a resource for scholars looking to conduct non-controlled comparisons to guide future scholars in new research directions."

The researcher will study local resonance, and how it behaves on many scales. As waves are used to excite a structure, there are particular frequencies which match the structure and cause extremely amplified motion; these are the natural frequencies. This type of phenomenon can be seen in earthquakes when building collapse happens seemingly at random, but is tied to the earthquake wave frequency matching the natural frequency of that structure. This phenomenon is known as resonance. This project will look at resonance on a much smaller scale using ultrasonic waves, which are longitudinal waves in the frequency above the audible sound for humans. These rapid waves require a much smaller structure in order to fall into a range where resonance is possible. When resonance occurs, the resulting concentration of the ultrasonic waves can be used to alter the material properties in that region. Earthquake waves and sound waves share similar properties and are governed by similar equations because they are both types of longitudinal waves. Therefore we can look to large-scale concepts to help us understand even very small material structures. The resources and expertise provided by Dr. Chin-Hsiung Loh and his laboratory group at National Taiwan University will be invaluable to the development of these concepts based on the group's extensive knowledge and past work concerning the fundamentals of wave propagation and behavior. In this project, the researcher and Dr. Loh's group will perform experiments and build models that can help predict and further understand local resonance within engineered materials. These materials can then be used to utilize and control waves. The implementation of established earthquake wave theories and simulations into nanomaterials will provide a more unabridged understanding of wave behavior over the broad range of engineering scale.<br/><br/>The research impacts of this material and the subsequent consolidation of fundamental wave theories would shift the thinking surrounding the traditionally undesirable side effect of ultrasonic heating into the purposeful field of controlled resistance and selective actuation. By exciting local resonance using ultrasonic waves in a liquid-filled chamber suspended in a soft matrix, it is hypothesized that the liquid can be heated significantly to produce a volumetric thermal expansion. This expansion would undoubtedly cause an outward pressure on the cavity and therefore on the soft surrounding matrix. This actuation would produce a resistive force that could stop deformation of the material structure due to an external pressure. The actuation of the liquid can be predicted through the thermal expansion coefficient, which will allow for the production of a repeatable and tailorable resulting pressure. As a further step in this research, it is the goal of the researcher to develop a nanocomposite with sets of linear chambers having identical resonances. After a particular chamber undergoes deformation, however, it would have a local resonance that is unique and independent of the undisturbed chambers and could be excited individually. This chamber would then undergo isolated pressurization causing centralized actuation limited to the chamber experiencing the deforming external pressure. The research will create a new type of actuation technology along with coupling acoustic wave resonance theory with ultrasonic heat transfer to produce novel wave vibration theories and numerical modeling. The experimental methods and analysis techniques would be unprecedented in the materials engineering field and would open the door for new uses of well-established structural health monitoring and analysis wave sensors. This research project seeks to collaborate across scale, diverse engineering fields, and unique individual backgrounds to create networks for future collaboration and discussion.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan."

However, although studies in birds have made seminal contributions to fields such as development, neurobiology, and immunology, bird research has been hindered by the limited availability of gene manipulation tools, including the ability to make transgenic birds. In other model species, such as mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies, it is much easier to generate transgenic animals that directly assess the role of a particular gene of interest. Some of the most successful transgenic technologies rely on gene-editing and isolating and modifying stem cells, and then transplanting them into hosts. In contrast, in birds, the advanced age of embryos at the time eggs are laid, and the lack of efficient viral vector tools has greatly limited gene manipulation efforts. To address these limitations, the investigators develop and improve gene manipulation and stem cell technologies in birds. The project focuses on the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird that is the most commonly used animal model to study the neural and genetic basis of human speech and language. Since other animal models commonly used in research do not have vocal learning, this is the first time that efficient methods for gene manipulation are being developed for a vocal learner species. Other beneficiaries include all avian research and possibly any egg-laying species, many of which are used to address questions in diverse areas of biology. The project also provides research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and outreach to communities typically underrepresented in science and technology fields.<br/><br/>To provide gene manipulation tools and protocols that will be useful not only to the songbird research community, but also to avian researchers in general, the investigators are: 1) generating transgenic zebra finches that express the genome-editing enzyme Cas9 under a ubiquitous promoter; 2) isolating, culturing, and utilizing primordial germ cells (PGCs) to improve the efficiency of generating transgenic zebra finches; and 3) developing efficient viral vectors for manipulating genes in zebra finch cells. Using established methods transgenic zebra finches are made by injecting VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors into freshly-laid fertilized eggs. When combined with CRISPR-designed guide RNAs, these transgenic songbirds enable gene-editing capabilities in a variety of tissues and cell types. To scale up and create many transgenic lines, PGC culture methods are being optimized and viral vectors with higher transfection rates in zebra finch cells developed, thus reducing the materials, time, and animals needed to create a new transgenic line, as well as greatly facilitating gene manipulations. The tools and optimized methods generated by this project will also impact avian research in fields other than birdsong biology. PGC culturing protocols can be applied to other avian species, viral vectors optimized for specific songbird tissues may also have higher transfection rates in analogous cell types of other avian species, and the Cas9-lentiviral construct could be used to generate other strains of Cas9-expressing transgenic birds."

In an electronic material, the valence of an atom tells us the strength of its combining power with other atoms, and does not usually change with time. In some very special materials, called 'mixed valence compounds', the valence rapidly fluctuates between more than one value. It is recently discovered by the principle investigator that stretching some of these mixed valence compounds could slow down or speed up the valence fluctuation. As a result, the electronic properties are effectively tuned to meet the requirements of device applications. In this project, the research team investigates the effect of stretching on mixed valence in several so-called 'strongly correlated materials'. Cousins of these materials have already found technological importance: high temperature superconductors for MRI diagnosis, giant magneto-resistance materials inside iPads, just to name two. This project pursues crystal growth, measurements and device fabrication on several mixed valence materials to unveil the nature of mixed valence physics and by extension explore their unusual electronic and thermal properties for technological applications such as ultra-high frequency oscillator and quantum metrology. Several educational components are integrated into this project, consisting of course development, K-12 outreach and scientific training for students. Internships for high school volunteers from disadvantaged regions in Santa Ana, as well as undergraduate researcher from UC Irvine's California Alliance for Minority Participation program are enabled by this project to generate interest and prepare for careers in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>     The normally well localized and magnetic 4f-electrons in rare earth compounds can in some materials become itinerant electrons with effective electron mass orders of magnitude larger than that of free electrons, leading variously to unusual 'strongly correlated' superconducting, magnetic and semiconducting states, these last known as Kondo insulators. Theory suggests that the Kondo insulator SmB6 belongs to the exotic class of so-called topological insulators possessing a surface conducting state with interesting technological potential. SmB6 is at present the only such strongly correlated f-band semiconductor for which experiment finds good evidence for this. The semiconducting energy gap scale in SmB6 is approximately 40K with the surface conducting state developing only below 4K. The principal investigators find that uniaxial strain strongly increases the gap energy and moves the development of the surface conducting state to 200K, approaching a range useful for application.<br/>     The goals of this project are to discover what sets the energy gap scale and accompanying development of the surface state, how this scale can be controlled and where other strongly correlated topological insulators can be found. This will be pursued in single crystal alloys of SmB6 and other Kondo insulators via transport, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements at ambient pressure and under strain. There is no reason to suppose that SmB6 is a unique material and understanding what sets the energy gap scale can present the rationale for discovery of other strongly correlated semiconductors in its exotic class with potential for application."

This project will be accomplished through a collaboration with Dr. Zong-Xin Ren, an expert in pollination ecology, at the Kunming Institute of Botany. The project will study changes in the diversity of bumblebees at different elevations and how their morphology and behavior change. This will be accomplished specifically by collecting bumblebee specimens, identifying them, and taking several measurements from them and the plants they pollinate.<br/><br/>Bumblebee tongue length is an indicator of likely foraging behavior. Long-tongued bees tend to be specialized to forage from specific flowers with long floral tubes while short-tongued bees tend to be generalists that visit many, more open-faced flowers. As elevation increases, temperatures tend to be lowered and the growing season tends to be shorter. During shorter seasons, we would expect bees to be more generalized in their foraging behavior as they are trying to capture the maximum amount of resources in a limited time frame. This project aims to create a network model demonstrating which bumblebees pollinate which flowers, this will give scientists a greater understanding of the current functions of bumblebees in the Himalayas and might aid in the identifying of functional mismatches due to shifting weather patterns that would likely cause shifts in bumblebee ranges.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

One of the solutions to solve these problems is to use three-dimensional (3D) structures, because hierarchical 3D structures enable efficient use of materials without changing the footprint in plane and lead to advanced functionalities that are otherwise out of reach. However, if conventional fabrication technologies are used to produce 3D structures, issues such as mechanical stability, conformity, alignment, process complexity and cost are difficult to address.The S-RuM based passive technology provides a revolutionary platform because of the self-assembly nature, which produces a 3D cylindrical structure from a 2D layout spontaneously once released from the mechanical support, minimizing mechanical stability concerns by avoiding processing on suspended or curved surfaces. The CMOS-compatibility of the materials and processes also makes integration with active devices and other passive components feasible. In contrast to the planar counterpart, this 3D platform promises to produce IC chips with dramatically enhanced inductance density, superior Q factor/frequency, and minimized substrate coupling. <br/> <br/>Personnel involved in this project, including one graduate student and two undergraduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through making a functional prototype that meets the needs of potential customers."

For device and sensor applications, the material's performance is strongly influenced by defects in the regularly-ordered atomic structure. These defects can be mobile, and nearby surfaces can inject or withdraw them from the solid bulk. Experiments and computations are being combined to examine how this chemistry is affected by the inherent tendency of the surface to accumulate excess positive or negative charge, and by the presence of liquids such as water. Experiments entail the exposure of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide to a gas or liquid containing isotopically-labeled atoms specially by weight, and subsequent measurement of the buildup of the label within the solid. Computations employ a range of modeling techniques rooted in quantum calculations. The project opens rich new possibilities for manipulating defect behavior in applications. Using liquids near room temperature is especially exciting because of greatly reduced cost and ease of material manufacturing compared to conventional methods that often employ gases and heating to hundreds of degrees. The project also develops educational materials for middle school and high school students. A significant number of undergraduate researchers participate in the research, and several activities to promote the importance of ethics in science and engineering are being pursued. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Reactions of ceramic semiconductor surfaces with bulk point defects such as interstitial atoms exhibit rich chemistry that is poorly understood despite that it helps to regulate defect types and concentrations. Experiments and computations are combined to examine how that chemistry is affected by surface polarity, which describes the tendency of the surface to accumulate excess positive or negative charge. The project also examines liquid-enhanced defect injection from the surface into the bulk. Investigations include zinc oxide of varying polar and nonpolar crystallographic orientations as well as nonpolar titanium dioxide. Experiments entail exposure of the solid to a gas or liquid containing isotopically labeled atoms, and subsequent measurement of the spatial distribution of the label within the solid. For gaseous ambients, interstitial atoms of both oxygen and titanium or zinc are being examined in the presence of foreign adsorbates such as nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine. For aqueous liquids, oxygen interstitial defects are being examined under varying pH, photostimulation intensity and solution additives. Computations employ a hierarchy of mathematical modeling rooted in quantum calculations to provide useful atomistic insights.  The project opens a rich new domain of surface behavior, and provides new means for manipulating defect behavior to improve photocatalysts, ultraviolet emitters and gas sensors."

The prospect of substantial and sometimes unexpected changes in economic, social, or foreign policy stimulates heated debate and strong emotions in the public. This evolving context allows for scholars to assess how emotion regulation shapes political behavior and attitudes. The activation of emotion in the face of unexpected events may manifest in a number of forms: posting on social media, attending town hall meetings, contacting elected officials, signing petitions, and/or participating in social movements. This knowledge helps to explain when and why emotions fuel broad-scale political participation and competition. The data generated from this project enables the investigators to assess theories about the influence of emotion regulation on political participation, i.e. how different types of emotion regulation strategies lead to different types of political behavior.  The project will also provide valuable data for the social science community more broadly.  In particular, the study will produce the first multi-wave panel survey tracking how individual attitudes and behavior change over time in response to political events during the first year of a party transition in the United States. The survey is the first in political science to study how emotion regulation habits vary across individuals in society and considers whether, over time, these habits lead to more consensus or greater polarization. The study utilizes established practices from psychology to measure emotion regulation habits in political contexts. The project also trains graduate and undergraduate students in machine learning, automated text coding, and text-analytics of open-ended survey responses. These are emerging as critical skills in the field of survey research as computing power opens new opportunities for understanding public attitudes through more free-form, naturalistic responses compared to traditional surveys. <br/><br/>Scientific Merit<br/>This study contributes to a growing body of research exploring the importance of socio-political emotions in fueling public attitudes and behavior. We develop new theory to explain how individual-level emotion regulation habits a) moderate the affective processing of information and b) influence expressive and social political behavior. Pilot tests indicate individuals adept at regulating their emotions through reappraising emotion-provoking stimuli were more likely to become politically active compared to those who use suppressive or avoidance regulation habits. Reappraisers are more likely to transmit their views to others, thus serving as a source of social contagion. This project uses a three-wave panel survey design to conduct a broader test of how emotion regulation shapes issue engagement, changes in perceptions of political responsibility, and changes in levels and forms of political participation. We draw our panel sample from a pool of respondents to a large online national survey conducted just prior to the 2016 elections to obtain pre-election baseline opinions on key policy topics like healthcare, the environment, tax reform, and military use. Subsequent waves of the panel study are timed to survey respondents during critical moments of policy change, or will follow an unexpected extraordinary event, should one arise. The design permits the investigators to observe individual-level change in the use of emotion regulation habits over time, and to test whether different emotion regulation habits make individuals more prone to reexamine their beliefs. If that is the case, these individuals could potentially change beliefs, or reject new information and maintain rigidity in attitudes. The research also allows the investigators to examine how emotion regulation influences or hinders political activism in response to emotionally provocative moments in society."

One way they accomplish this is through the perception and response to light. A key group of proteins involved in modulating light-mediated responses are the AHLs, a group of DNA-binding proteins that influence stem elongation in seedlings. Stem elongation is among the first crucial steps in plant development for many crop plants. As the climate continues to change, it is increasingly important for us to gain a better understanding of how stem elongation is controlled, as it will facilitate the improvement of crop varieties that can cope with such changes. This EAPSI fellowship will enable further investigation into the role AHLs play in stem elongation, and how this elongation is further regulated by plant hormones. This research will be conducted at the RIKEN Institute under the direction of Dr. Keiko Sugimoto, a leading expert in plant cell research.<br/><br/>Using Arabidopsis as a model system, the overarching goal of this research is to understand how light mediates seedling growth. One key group of genes involved in this process is the AT-HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIED (AHL) gene family. AHL29/SUPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME B-4 (SOB3) directly regulates the auxin-associated genes YUCCA8 (YUC8) and members of the SMALL AUXIN UP RNA 19 (SAUR19) subfamily during seedling development. SOB3 is able to modulate hypocotyl elongation in seedlings, at least in part, by repressing transcription of the aforementioned genes. Since YUC8 and members of the SAUR19 subfamily are directly involved in phytohormone pathways, ChIP-Seq will be used to test the hypothesis that SOB3 binds to the promoters of additional genes associated with plant-specific hormone pathways, such as gibberellic acid, cytokinins, and jasmonic acid. Additionally, hypocotyl elongation assays will be performed using sob mutants and the aforementioned hormones to further investigate these interactions.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

This project will consider faster algorithms for various problems involving hypergraphs cuts. This research will be conducted at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan, in collaboration with Professor Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, an expert in graph theory and graph algorithms.<br/><br/>Hypergraphs can be dense, therefore, processing the hypergraph incurs substantial cost in both space and time. Finding a sparse hypergraph that approximates all the cuts allows one to use the sparse hypergraph in place of the original hypergraph, which might be much faster.

Mechanical contact between dissimilar surfaces is a ubiquitous part of life and thus a buildup of electric charge is constantly happening. Harvesting of this buildup of electrical charge provides an opportunity for the generation of electricity for devices that operate at very small scales. The tools for understanding and capitalizing on this phenomenon have only become available in the last decade due to the advent of nanotechnology. This fundamental research will provide a theoretical framework based on complementary modeling and experiments, which will allow the research team to engineer ""triboelectric nanogenerators"" that are capable of harvesting significant amounts of power in a more controlled way. Triboelectric nanogenerators have demonstrated a high area-wise power density of up to 1.2 kW/m2, a volume-wise power density of up to 490 kW/m3 (compare this to the stellar fusion of hydrogen ~276.5 W/m3), and similarly a very high energy conversion efficiency of ~50-85%. Harvesting of this energy that is inherently available from dissimilar surfaces is central to this research and can potentially pay dividends to the economy and society. This research will involve many disciplines including contact mechanics, solid mechanics, materials science, electrical engineering, and manufacturing. Participation of underrepresented groups in research and pedagogy will also be facilitated and broadened in this program through direct participation and exposure.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental mechanism of triboelectrification and the surface charge density in triboelectric nanogenerators through the lens of a first-principles investigation, both theoretically and experimentally.

These chemical regulators dictate an array of plant physiological processes. Despite the recent advances in plant hormone signaling, much is still unknown. This work will look at two novel plant hormone binding proteins and their function in plants. The researcher will attempt to uncover the roles that these two novel proteins play in hormone signaling.  The research will be conducted under the direction of Professor Chiu-Ping Cheng. The project will be performed at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. National Taiwan University is a premiere research institute with equipment and instruments required for the project. The knowledge of plant immunity, plant diseases resistance, and plant molecular biology that Dr. Chiu-Ping Cheng, the host professor, possesses would be invaluable to the project.<br/><br/>Salicylic acid is a phenolic plant hormone with critical importance in plant physiology, plant development, and plant disease resistance. Prior work identified targets of salicylic acid utilizing state of the art protein microarrays. Two plant lectin-domain containing proteins were identified as novel salicylic acid binding protein, however their function in salicylic acid signaling is unknown. This work will be pivotal in understanding the mode of action of immune signaling and hormone perception in plants. Specifically, this work will investigate the roles and function of hormone-binding plant lectins with respect to hormone signaling, abiotic defenses, and immune signaling. The knowledge is instrumental to efforts to bolster pathogen and abiotic defense responses in plants.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan."

The project aims to increase understanding of factors that contribute to building  a foundation for science learning in the critical elementary school years by providing elementary teachers who teach in underperforming, high-poverty schools with 1) the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge to more effectively engage students in science learning and achievement and 2) the leadership skills to develop powerful professional learning communities that can support and sustain improved elementary science instruction.  The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) observed that learning science is a cumulative process, requiring strong groundwork to be laid in childhood.  Because relatively few initiatives focus on elementary level STEM instruction, this project provides a bellwether opportunity to accumulate and disseminate unique knowledge about best practices for improved elementary science education. Project results will not only shape effective strategies for improving science teaching and learning across New York City classrooms, schools, and districts, but also serve as a national model for driving better STEM outcomes through the enhancement of elementary STEM education. <br/><br/>This College of Staten Island (CSI) Master Teaching Fellowships Noyce project will recruit 16 K-5 experienced and exemplary elementary teachers working in high-need, low performing schools in New York City's District 31 and prepare them to become science teacher leaders in this District.  The project, in partnership with the non-profit Staten Island MakerSpace, will enable these elementary teachers to advance their science teaching while, simultaneously, facilitating development of leadership skills to create a network of science teacher leaders with the collective capacity to improve the quality of science teaching across the district's high-need elementary schools.  To build these competencies, the project will engage teachers in a blended, multi-component Professional Development (PD) that includes: a) content-based graduate level courses at CSI with integrated STEM research/lab experiences on campus, led by CSI STEM faculty; b) face-to-face training led by CSI School of Education faculty and Discovery Institute experts in the fields of teacher leadership, curriculum, and pedagogy; and c) online and face-to-face collaboration with project faculty and MTF peers. The PD will also include a school and field-based component that is integrated into the daily work of participating teachers by involving them in delivering workshops in STEM learning and teaching to colleagues at their own schools and at the Staten Island MakerSpace. By focusing on teachers' development in three overlapping waves - teacher as science learner, teacher as science teacher, and teacher as facilitator of professional community - the project will develop educators' capacity to affect their individual classrooms and schools as well as district-wide science instruction."

The southeastern United States has recently experienced the most extreme drought in at least 10 years.  Alabama has been particularly hard hit, with nearly 98% of the state being directly affected by drought conditions.  The lack of rainfall during Fall 2016 reduced many streams to trickles while others have completely dried; major rivers reached low levels not seen in over 60 years. Alabama is known as a global biodiversity hotspot for freshwater species of fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. Many of these species are threatened, endangered, and/or found nowhere else on Earth. This study seeks to determine the role of downstream refuges on the effect of intense droughts in aquatic ecosystems with high species diversity. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine changes in species composition in response to intense drought, 2) Identify habitat offering critical refuge from the drought to species with different movement abilities, 3) Build a predictive model of the effects of intense drought and future recovery at local and regional scales. Two graduate students and several undergraduates will be involved in the sampling and research activities of the study. This research will provide management tools to identify and protect Alabama Strategic Habitat Units. The study also will offer summer camps for middle-school students and public outreach activities to citizen science groups organized with collaboration of the Auburn University Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>The study will assess the impacts of extreme drought on the dynamics of habitat use as well as evaluate the resilience of aquatic species to flash drought. The investigators hypothesize that the ability to use downstream refuge during drought is a bottleneck that varies based on species vagility and position in the stream network. Stream habitats in two drainages that have experienced the exceptional drought will be sampled and compared to historic, baseline data collected since 2012 to test this hypothesis. The study will predict shifts in distribution patterns of stream fauna in response to flash drought by combining pre-drought survey and environmental DNA (eDNA) data from streams of various sizes in two ecoregions of Alabama, with species-specific vagility potential based on functional trait databases, life history information, and professional judgment. Predicted and observed patterns will be compared using fine scale surveys, broad scale eDNA collections, and spatial analysis. The results of this investigation will provide critical information pertinent to understanding the resiliency of specific taxa and stream communities in general to drought disturbance in a global hotspot for diversity."

This project is focused on a collaborative design, implementation, and study of recurrent engineering-focused interventions with middle school youth in three rural and Appalachian communities. The intervention efforts will broaden middle schoolers' participation and understanding of what engineering is, what engineers do, and help dispel the notion that it is hard and requires a love of mathematics and science. The project has the potential for recruiting future engineers who are unaware of their abilities and career possibilities because of the rural Appalachian communities in which they live. Broadening participation in engineering remains a critical national priority and this project has the potential to prevent the loss of smart capable students from engineering education and career pathways. The proposed partnership with school educators and industry experts will established an open-source engineering outreach curriculum (iFixit) and facilitate regular in-class interventions throughout the academic year. <br/><br/>The study design enables the examination of the participants and interventions across time and case-site contexts, where the data are collected at individual-level to look for changes over time while within-case and cross-case examination of the community-level impacts will be analyzed. The objective will be to achieve meaningful results of the two goals: Goal 1- to increase youth awareness of, interest in, and readiness for diverse engineering related careers and educational pathways which is a goal that hinges on a collaboratively designed and facilitated set of monthly interventions in a curricular setting and Goal 2- to build capacity for schools to sustainably integrate engineering skills and knowledge of diverse engineering-related careers and educational pathways aimed at both the individual-level with a focus on teachers as influential change makers as well as at the community-level focused on sustainable cross-sector collaborations. The project will offer in-school curriculum activities (interventions) six times per academic year in three similar rural communities in Virginia: 1) Bedford County Public Schools 2) Giles County Public Schools, and 3) Smyth County Public Schools. All case sites are located in rural areas or near Appalachia where there is limited industry, particularly advanced industry exposes students, parents, and educators to engineering careers. Leveraging local expertise is especially critical in this project because family pressures, cultural milieu, and preference for local, stable jobs play considerable roles in how Appalachian youth choose possible careers."

The expected outcome of this project is a simpler and less error-prone way to build computer systems that use advanced cryptography. <br/><br/>This project explores a new way to put the full power of cryptography in the hands of programmers. Programmers will not design cryptography directly. Instead, they will develop software using a high-level programming language, and the Viaduct system will automatically introduce sophisticated cryptographic mechanisms as needed to make the software secure. Viaduct automatically compiles high-level protocols to primitive cryptographic  building blocks, offering formal security guarantees in the form of machine-checkable security proofs. The project demonstrates end-to-end synthesis based on universal composability as a practical way to build secure systems.  Viaduct will make security engineering stronger, easier, and cheaper.

For example, hiring decisions typically involve the evaluation of a set of job candidates; housing decisions involve selection from among a set of applicants; voting decisions are made from among a set of candidates running for office. Rational theories of choice suggest that decision makers' preferences between any two options within a set should remain the same regardless of the number or the quality of other options. Yet, research has shown that people's preferences for each option in a choice set shift in predictable ways depending on the other available alternatives. We see this in the study of consumer behavior, for example, where the introduction of a third inferior product changes consumers' preferences for the two original products (the so-called ""decoy effect""). When choices involve other people, social stereotypes and associated emotions often lead to systematic discrimination, especially against marginalized social groups. In this project, investigator Mina Cikara of Harvard University examines how the construction of choice sets -- choice architecture -- influences discrimination. Most past efforts to reduce bias in social decisions have focused on changing perceivers' stereotypes and prejudices. In contrast, this project focuses on changing the context in which choices are presented as a way to reduce discrimination. Drawing from formal models of decision making in cognitive psychology and computational biology, the research addresses a major gap in knowledge about the role of choice architecture in discrimination and provides insights that may reduce discriminatory practices in a variety of consequential social contexts.<br/><br/>This project adopts an inter-disciplinary approach, integrating methods and findings from cognitive and social psychology, neuroeconomics, and computational biology to examine a neglected, but potentially powerful source of discrimination reduction: choice architecture. Formal models of decision-making make specific predictions about both the mechanisms by which social ""decoys"" should influence decisions and the temporal dynamics underlying the decision process. Integrating insights from these models into the study of social-decision making allows for greater predictive precision and stimulates innovative strategies for reducing bias. A series of experiments and field studies in the domains of hiring, housing, and voting decisions test whether social decoys can increase decision-makers' preferences for groups that are otherwise disadvantaged (e.g., elderly, racial minorities, women). Further experiments use participants' susceptibility to decoy effects to quantify the influence of demographic and stereotype-related attributes on social decision-making. A final set of experiments manipulate participants' exposure to targets' attribute information to move toward bias-reduction interventions that do not require fabricating or selectively including social decoys in choice sets. This research program provides training to a diverse group of students. The research results will be broadly disseminated, with special efforts to reach managers in industry. Many points of contact are made with other areas of scientific inquiry, including neuroscience, sociology, economics and biology. The project offers broad societal impacts, including the opportunity for public and private institutions to gain insight into shaping policy that can reduce social bias at many different scales."

However, the unavoidable involvement of untrusted parties  who can insert malicious circuits (i.e., hardware Trojans), steal intellectual property (IP), and produce counterfeits have made hardware more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. National defense, welfare, and economic growth all suffer through 1) weaker security and quality of critical infrastructures; 2) substantial economic and reputational losses for IP owners; 3) increased revenue for terrorist groups, criminals, and adversarial nation states; and 4) lower incentive to innovate and develop new products. The objective of this project is to advance the state-of-the-art in hardware obfuscation for IP protection. Hardware obfuscation refers to transformation of a circuit design into one that is functionally equivalent to the original, but infeasible to reverse engineer and/or obtain unrestricted use without significant effort. <br/><br/>This project targets four major limitations associated with existing hardware obfuscation techniques: 1) Impractical overheads for real-world designs; 2) Susceptibility to attacks; 3) Poor scalability to large circuits of practical interest; and 4) lack of metrics and benchmarks in the research community to objectively compare different methods. Efficiency and scalability are being improved by developing novel circuit entropy metrics and holistic obfuscation algorithms that operate on decision diagrams. Outreach activities dedicated to obfuscation and awareness of IP piracy issues include creation of the first publically available benchmarks, conducting online global competitions, and generating new course materials, projects, and book. Through integration of these activities, measureable improvements in the attack resistance of obfuscated combinational and sequential designs are expected by project's end."

It is a fundamental building block for most large-scale simulations from physics, chemistry, biology, material sciences as engineering.  Open MPI is an open source implementation of the MPI specification, widely used and adopted by the research community as well as industry. The Open MPI library is jointly developed and maintained by a consortium of academic institutions, national labs and industrial partners. It is installed on virtually all large-scale computer systems in the US as well as in the rest of the world. The goal of this project is to enhance and modernize the Open MPI library in the context of the ongoing evolution of modern computer systems, and to ensure its future operability on all upcoming architectures. We aim at implementing fundamental software techniques that can be used in many-core systems to execute MPI-based parallel applications more efficiently, and to tolerate process and memory failures at all scales, from current systems, up to the extreme scales expected before the end of the decade.<br/><br/>Open MPI is an open source implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) specification. The MPI API is currently being extended to consider the needs of application developers in terms of efficiency, productivity and resilience. The project will also support academic involvement in the design, development and evaluation of the Open MPI software, and ensure academic presence in the MPI Forum. The goal of this proposal is to enhance the Open MPI software library, focusing on two aspects: (1) Extend Open MPI to support new features of the MPI specification. Open MPI will continue to support all new features of current and upcoming MPI specifications. The two most significant areas within the context of this proposal are (a) extensions to better support hybrid programming models and (b) support for fault tolerance in MPI applications. To improve support for hybrid programming models, the MPI Forum is currently considering introducing the notion of MPI Endpoints, which could be used by different threads of an MPI rank to instantiate multiple separate communication contexts. The goal within this project is to develop an implementation of endpoints to support effective hybrid programming model, and to extend the concept to other aspects of parallel applications such as File I/O operations. One of the project partners (UTK) leads the current proposal in the MPI Forum to expose failures and ensure the continuation of the execution of MPI applications. In the context of this SSI proposal, the goal is to harden, improve, and expand the support of the existing ULFM implementation in Open MPI and thus enable end-users to design application-specific resilience approaches for future platforms. (2) Enhance the Open MPI core to support new architectures and improve scalability. While Open MPI has demonstrated very good scalability in the past, there is significant work to be done to ensure similarly good performance on future architectures. Specifically, we propose a groundbreaking rework of the startup environment that will improve process launch scalability, increase support for asynchronous progress of operations, enable support for accelerators, and reduce sensitivity to system noise.

Suitable replacements have yet to be realized for piezoelectric materials (those that change shape with applied electric field and vice versa) that are important for a large range of devices and applications, such as actuators, accelerometers, filters, vibration control, fuel injection, ink jet printing, ultrasound generation and sensing, and resonators. One class of materials that shows great promise as replacements is based on bismuth sodium titanate (BNT). In thin films for microelectronic applications, the fundamental piezoelectric effect in these new materials is not yet understood well enough to allow devices to be reliably implemented. Accordingly, the objective of this project is to explore the mechanisms associated with piezoelectricity in BNT-based piezoelectric thin films using novel characterization methods available at Professor Hiroshi Funakubo's laboratory at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Professor Funakubo's characterization tools allow for the measurement of atomic structure while applying electric fields, giving direct insight into the piezoelectric strain mechanisms of these exceptional materials.<br/><br/>In bulk form, these BNT-based materials belong to a class of materials called relaxor ferroelectrics, which show enticing properties with regards to electric field induced displacement mechanisms that are just beginning to be understood. Many BNT-based compositions show the strain and polarization behavior that is characteristic of a reversible field-induced relaxor-to-ferroelectric phase transition; these are known as ergodic relaxors. However, BNT-based materials in thin film embodiments do not exhibit the enhanced properties that are found in the bulk. In particular, the ergodic relaxor compositions that have been studied in thin films do not show the signs of a reversible field-induced relaxor-to-ferroelectric phase transition, but rather behave similar to normal ferroelectrics and have comparatively low displacements. This differing response between bulk and thin films needs to be understood for this promising material system to be viable for real-world applications. Therefore, novel in situ microstructural characterization methods (2D X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy), available at the host institution, will be applied to elucidate the electric field induced strain mechanisms in BNT-based piezoelectric thin films.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

SEHRS is a technique provide unique information about molecules adsorbed on a surface. The success of this work has the potential to impact a wide range of studies, especially the geometry of a molecule adsorbed on a surface differs in complex environments.  It can also make a difference in deep-tissue imaging.  Furthermore, Professors Camden and Svarovsky and their groups also work on ways to reduce the cost of SEHRS spectrometers, making SEHRS accessible to a wide range of researchers and analytical problems. Students working in these two labs have a great opportunity to learn different skills through collaboration. As a way to engage a new and national K-12 audience in outreach efforts, Professors Camden and Svarovsky also plan to work with the University of Notre Dame's Center for STEM Education together and launch a new Citizen Science project called U-Watch. The program will bring the benefits of surface-based spectroscopy research supported by this grant to a broad audience and could identify potentially dangerous levels of contamination, such as uranium, in ground water drinking sources.<br/><br/>In this work, SEHRS is used to provide information that is not available via other techniques. New methods for single-molecule SEHRS are used to probe nanoparticle-adsorbate interactions at the level of single molecules in complex chemical environments.  SEHRS nanoparticles also serve as a platform for near-infrared and short-wave-infrared (SWIR) (0.8-2.5 Pm) sensing, imaging, and authentication. The Notre Dame groups also plan to develop the characterization methods needed to pursue the rational design of SWIR tags and apply them to deep-tissue imaging studies.  A comparison of SEHRS and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) shows that SEHRS can be more sensitive than SERS in certain situations. Lastly, they explore the potential for hand-held, field-portable devices capable of recording SEHRS spectra with continuous-wave lasers.

Electric fishes exhibit many interesting characteristics or phenotypes, but very little is known about how these phenotypes are encoded in the genetic material or genome. Understanding this relation is a broad goal in 21st century biology.  Electric fish offer a singular advantage in trying to understand the link between the genome and the phenotype it produces: two groups of electric fish evolved independently in Africa and South America, providing a system where biologists of all stripes can attack genotype-phenotype questions with built-in replication.  There is a growing amount of electric fish genomic data; however, there are no functional tools to investigate this connection.  The purpose of this project is to develop a robust, accessible, and easily transferable genetic manipulation toolbox for the electric fish model system full range of questions under investigation, regardless of a researchers' background. The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, and the second phase of the project will be to disseminate knowledge gained by developing web-based software for sharing protocols, data, and resources, and to train the next generation of electric fish biologists--undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds--in the use of these techniques in preparation for careers in science and technology. <br/><br/>The proposed project, is divided into two phases.  The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, with the specific aims to: (1) generate stable mutant and transgenic lines of electric fish using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, (2) express transgenic material using viral-mediated techniques, and (3) knockdown specific endogenous gene activity using morpholinos.  The second phase of the project is dissemination of knowledge and community infrastructure improvement, with the specific aims to: (1) establish and distribute genomic resources and tools that enable the community to target genes of interest and (2) disseminate protocols developed in Phase 1 by broadening participation in the field and training the next generation of electric fish biologists to harness these powerful new techniques.  The project accelerates significantly research on genotype-phenotype interaction across the full range of NSF-IOS priority areas because it combines the power of genomic manipulation and a globally accessible model system with extensive phenotypic data that span biological levels of analysis from molecules to populations.   Examples of such studies include: (1) insight into ion channel function (2) identification of transduction molecules in electrosensory systems, (3) identification of developmental mechanisms governing the repeated evolution of electroreceptors and electric organs, (5) optogenetics-enabled dissections of brain circuits (6) link genetic changes and the evolution of reproductive isolation.   An outcome of this project is the enablement of the electric fish community to develop new and exciting hypotheses and projects spanning the gamut of biological disciplines, and act as ""ambassadors"" to other non-canonical model systems to apply newly developed techniques."

The question of how stars form is fascinating in itself and has a great impact on several other areas of astrophysics. There is a general consensus that a predominant amount of star formation in our Galaxy takes place in molecular clouds, and specifically in giant molecular clouds (GMC). Consequently, NASA has made multi-million dollar investments in instruments such as HAWC+ on the SOFIA airborne observatory with the specific goal of understanding the turbulent nature of star forming clouds. This project on Blue Waters will use the petascale capabilities of the system to validate theories of star formation by simulating the same processes the NASA's instruments are currently measuring.<br/><br/>This project will carry out simulations on Blue Waters that integrate the ions and the neutrals to reproduce the turbulent, partially ionized gas in which stars form.  Since neutral gas does not couple to the magnetic field, but ionized gas do, the project has built frontline simulation capabilities for simulating two-fluid plasmas. Simultaneously, the project has built theoretical and numerical analysis tools that will enable cross-comparison of simulations with observations. This cross-comparison provides important verification of theories of star formation. Further diagnostics that emerge from the simulations will also be used to motivate more detailed observations. In this fashion, Blue Waters will enable theory, computation and detailed observations to support one another.  In addition, the project intends to combine education in computational astrophysics with code releases of their simulation tools to the greater astrophysics community."

Behaviors are important because they can affect animal survival and reproduction. But with closely related species, similar behaviors can vary. So how can behaviors integral to survival retain their functionality yet also change across species? This project will investigate both the gene-behavior relationship and how it changes using sea fireflies. Many species make glowing displays to attract mates, but these displays differ between species. The gene responsible for making light in these displays, called luciferase, was first described by Dr. Yoshihiro Ohmiya, currently at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan. He and his colleague Dr. Yasuo Mitani will collaborate with the investigator on this project to show how luciferase has changed across sea fireflies. Using techniques developed by Dr. Ohmiya, the investigator will take luciferase from different species and examine how they function to see if any differences can describe changes in their glowing displays.<br/><br/>This project aims to connect genotype to behavioral phenotype using sea fireflies. Sea fireflies create bioluminescent mating displays by secreting globs of mucus where the enzyme luciferase oxidizes the substrate vargulin to produce light. In a single bolus, the amount of light and duration of the biochemical reaction varies between species. The investigator will learn molecular cloning, plasmid construction, and protein expression assays from collaborators who invented these techniques. They will characterize luciferase from a suite of species and test if these enzymes have a differential ability to produce light. These data will be combined with behavioral data to test for a correlation between biochemical function and behavioral display differences between species.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

The investigators decompose such auditing into stages, where the level of access granted to an auditor is increased when potential (but not explainable) violations of privacy or fairness are detected. Workshops and public releases of code and data amplify the investigators' interactions with policy makers and other stakeholders.  Their partnerships with outreach organizations encourage diversity."

Recent research has identified remote radiative heating and cooling, for example the cooling effect volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols, as a driver of north-south shifts in tropical precipitation associated with the intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs; narrow regions of high preciptation over the oceans near the equator). Such shifts are implicated in the prolonged drought in the Sahel region of North Africa during the latter half of the 20th century, and could be consequential for other regions as well.  Research on the role of remote heating and cooling has also produced an explanation for why the Pacific and Atlantic ITCZs are typically north of the equator, and for the southward shift of the Atlantic ITCZ shown in proxy data from the last ice age, when much of the Northern Hemisphere was covered with highly reflective ice and snow. <br/><br/>The relationship between ITCZ shifts and remote radiative forcing is explained in terms of inter-hemispheric heat transport: if one hemisphere is cooled relative to the other heat will be transported from the warmer hemisphere toward the colder hemisphere, and atmospheric energy transport across the equator will take place through the  upper-tropospheric branch of the Hadley circulation.  But the overturning motion of the Hadley cell requires that as energy is transported in one direction at upper levels moisture must be transported the other way near the surface.  Thus moisture crosses the equator from the colder hemisphere to the warmer hemisphere, resulting in a shift of ITCZ precipitation toward the warmer hemisphere (in today's climate the Northern Hemisphere is colder on average than the Southern Hemisphere, thus the ITCZ is north of the equator).<br/><br/>This project continues the PIs' exploration of the relationship between radiative forcing, inter-hemispheric heat transport, and north-south shifts of ITCZ precipitation.  One key issue is that the theory assumes that cross-equatorial heat transport will occur in the atmosphere, and the theory was developed using atmospheric models coupled to ""slab"" ocean models which do not allow changes in ocean transport.  Preliminary evidence suggests that the extent to which the transport occurs in the ocean rather than the atmosphere depends on where the radiative forcing occurs, for example heat transport in response to radiative forcing in the middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere appears to occur primarily in the ocean, while radiative forcing in the North Atlantic yields more transport in the atmosphere than in the ocean.  The PIs perform experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to understand the dependence of the partitioning of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean and to determine how this partitioning depends on the region in which the radiative forcing is applied. Other issues pursued here include differences in ITCZ response when the radiative forcing occurs over land rather than ocean surfaces, and differences in the response depending on the magnitude and sign (heating versus cooling) of the radiative forcing.<br/><br/>Shifts in tropical precipitation are of great practical as well as scientific interest given the region's large population and vulnerability. Attempts to anticipate future changes in tropical precipitation rely on output from climate models, but such guidance is hampered by large differences in simulated precipitation change from one model to another.  A theoretical framework for understanding precipitation change is thus highly desirable.  Beyond the societal broader impacts of the research itself, the PIs perform a variety of outreach activities, including educational videos for grades K-12 and at local venues such as the Seattle Science Center.  In addition, the project supports and mentors a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing for the furture workforce in this research area."

Ensuring that this critical workforce is broadly inclusive of individuals with relevant capabilities and skills requires a highly adaptive, networked system of interdisciplinary educational collaboration, and innovative employment preparation strategies, programs, and approaches. This approach constitutes a partnership of scientists and engineers, educators, trainers, innovation networks, laboratories, research institutions, and employers. This science policy research report addresses these issues, detailing barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations, focusing on people with disabilities and high technology industry and non-government employers. Distinct applications of related research are studied, such as the inclusion of veterans who became disabled in the line of service, and with applicable education and training, could be new participants in the STEM workforce. This is especially important as both these populations might not be aware of, or not actively involved in social networks of STEM innovators, and conversely technology innovators might not fully consider these individuals. The report explores new frameworks, decision support tools, dissemination design parameters, and knowledge-generating communities to provide lessons learned and guidance for innovative best practices and inclusion in STEM disciplines. Addressing the under-representation of people with disabilities in STEM fields, it offers an analysis of relevant research and policy approaches and looks to inform related government agenda setting and decision making.<br/><br/>Much research on the STEM participation of people with disabilities has tended to emphasize specific disability characteristics. Building upon findings generated during the 2016 Symposium on the Science of Broadening Participation (SoBP), sponsored by the National Science Foundation, this project takes a wider, interdisciplinary perspective, looking a range of social, economic, methodological, institutional, and policy contexts. Identifying barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations and policy approaches, the report addresses the need for novel approaches to developing and nurturing a qualified, diverse, and agile U.S. STEM workforce. The report articulates a framework for developing tools and approaches to understand the role of collaborative networks of innovation that encourage STEM participation of individuals with disabilities. The report explores research that can enhance broadened participation, and addresses areas in which targeted efforts would be valuable, including a toolkit for assessing innovative practices and organizational structures in the context of knowledge transfer and closing knowledge-practice gaps, and a sustainable design for a Professional Inclusive Innovation Network (PIIN) of innovation nodes and researchers to test inclusive practices. The PIIN presents the SoBP community with an opportunity to capture relevant research and policy data, cultivate meaningful programs at the appropriate scale, and develop a network of mentors, advocates, and others to inform the SoBP community and other stakeholders. The toolkit coupled with an iterative observatory approach allows for bottom-up insights that speak specifically to regional context, culture, and population needs, promoting favorable outcomes."

Inspired by the architectural principles of enzymes, these catalysts are designed to have a pocket for binding substrates (alkynes) and the catalytic functional groups (gold atoms) directed inwardly towards the binding pocket. There are three main thrusts in this project. The first objective focuses on studying chemical transformations catalyzed by a cavitand that has one gold(I) atom coordinated to a 3-walled resorcinarene. This research aims to differentiate the supramolecular catalyst with well-defined binding pocket from simpler gold catalysts and to evaluate the role of molecular recognition on substrate selectivity, regio- and diastereo-chemical properties of reaction products, and reaction rates. The second thrust explores the catalytic properties of bis-gold(I) cavitands.  The confined space and placement of two adjacent gold atoms result in new modes of alkyne reactivity, e.g., yne-yne coupling reaction.

They limit coastal erosion, mitigate storm effects, and are important buffer system between coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. These environments are also responsible for removing harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere including nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. This project will aid in the restoration of a salt marsh environment located in Shanghai, China. The study will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Xuechu Chen, an expert in ecological engineering. Dr. Chen has advanced the field in wetland restoration through his publication contributions and commitment to international communications and collaborations. The goal of the study is to enhance the natural chemical processes of salt marsh environments in an effort to remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  <br/><br/>The proposed study seeks to investigate the effects of biochar addition on salt marsh restoration. Biochar is a soil enhancer that is often used to improve soil quality and can be a mechanism to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Biochar is expected to aid in nitrous oxide removal by enhancing the denitrification process through organic carbon additions. It has the potential to enhance plant growth and slows the return of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, facilitating carbon sequestration. The study site, Bihaijinsha, is located within northern Hangzhou Wan Bay, Fengxian District, Shanghai. It is a restored salt marsh about 6000m2 that underwent sediment addition as part of the restoration process. Biochar will be added to designated plots within the study area. Through the use of a gas analyzer, the greenhouse gases fluxes of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide will be monitored from these plots. It is expected that gas fluxes will decrease over time and plant growth will increase. The restoration technique proposed in this project will help restore the biogeochemical processes within a salt marsh environment, promoting essential ecosystem services. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

By analyzing the genetic diversity of different populations of organisms across complex environments, inferences can be made about the timing and distribution of such historical processes and their impacts on species evolution. The Hengduan Mountain Region (HMR) is positioned at the transition zone between the Tibetan Plateau and lowland southwest China. This region is unique in having repeated, parallel, montane river systems that run across dramatic elevational and environmental gradients. Studies have shown that the major rivers of the region (Mekong, Salween, and Yangtze) have experienced significant changes in drainage patterns and flow directions in the past due to the continental collisions between Eurasia and India and the subsequent formation of the Tibetan Plateau, and these geological events have impacted genetic structures among some aquatic animals and plants in the region. However, the timing and geographic scope of changes in river topology remain poorly understood, and nothing is known to date about the impact of such events on the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. Lizard species of the genus Japalura are recognized to be associated closely with habitats along river systems in the HMR. With many species endemic to the HMR, the group of terrestrial lizards is well suited for investigating the impact of historical geologic- and environmental-changes on population and species diversification in the region. In collaboration with Dr. Jing Che from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this research will employ modern molecular techniques to the genetic data of endemic lizards in the HMR. Through field-based surveys of species diversity of lizards and lab-based studies of genetic diversity of the focal species group across the HMR, this research not only will promote biodiversity and conservation studies of the focal species group in a fragile ecosystem, but also, it will further our knowledge of the historical importance of the formation of the Tibetan Plateau for changes in river systems as well as for vertebrate diversification in the HMR.<br/><br/>During the research period in China, fieldwork will be conducted in targeted valley habitats along the three major rivers (Mekong, Salween, and Yangtze) in the Hengduan Mountain Region (HMR) of China to increase available taxonomic and geographic sampling of focal lizard species in the genus Japalura. Combined with samples available already at the host institution in China, genomic DNA will be extracted from tissue samples, and target genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) will be amplified and sequenced at the host institute in China. Phylogenetic approaches will be employed to study population genetic and biogeographic patterns, and estimate the timing of lineage divergence, among focal lizard species across the HMR. The results will be used to formulate biogeographical hypotheses concerning the role that historical changes in river system and formation of mountain ranges played in the vertebrate diversification around the Tibetan Plateau.<br/><br/>The award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

There are two subspecies of P. rapae: P. r. rapae and P. r. crucivora, the latter being endemic to the islands of Japan. These subspecies have diverged in coloration, pheromone profiles, and mate choice behaviors. In addition, research on their reproductive physiology suggests functional mismatches between reproductive proteins may have also arisen during the ~5,000 years that these subspecies have been geographically separated. The specific identities of these mismatched proteins, and their associated genes, remain undescribed.

The research will be conducted at SOKENDAI in Hayama, Japan in collaboration with Dr. Kentaro Arikawa, a leading world expert on butterfly research.<br/><br/>In Japan, the researcher will collect biological samples, including DNA from wild caught individuals and RNA from lab-reared virgin females. The DNA sequences and RNA expression levels for genes of interest will be assessed for divergence between the two subspecies. Further, the research will determine whether genes of interest (i.e., those involved in reproductive interactions between the female reproductive tract and male ejaculate) show signatures of adaptive evolution. Such a finding would indicate that these reproductive traits evolve at elevated rates, consistent with the hypothesis that this reproductive interface could play a role in the divergence and/or maintenance of these two subspecies.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Quantifying denitrification is important because the gases produced during denitrification cause poor air quality that damages human health. Also, because nitrogen limits the ability of plants to grow, quantifying it will allow for better predictions about carbon storage. Denitrification is nearly impossible to measure directly, and as such, developing an accurate model is essential. This project will be conducted at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia under the mentorship of Dr. Ying-Ping Wang. The collaboration provides access to the expertise and computing capacity at CSIRO. <br/><br/>Denitrification removes biologically available nitrogen (N) from ecosystems, making it an important control over the biosphere's N balance, with implications for air quality, human health, and climate change. Despite its importance, estimates of the global soil denitrification flux remain highly uncertain. Major challenges lie in directly measuring the gaseous by-products of denitrification and scaling this complex microbial processes. Process-based models constrained by empirical isotopic evidence have emerged as a method to help overcome these challenges. However, the robustness of this method is limited by incomplete understanding of isotopic expression of denitrification and how it varies across known controls, such as carbon and nitrate availability and soil moisture and temperature. The project will determine how the isotopic expression of denitrification varies across a range of environmental controls and will incorporate this data into models of denitrification.   Ultimately this model will be incorporated into the CASA-CNP, the global model of nutrient limitations on terrestrial carbon sequestration developed by scientists at CSIRO. This will reduce a key uncertainty in predictions of carbon sequestration. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a US graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Fishes, like other vertebrates, share a conserved set of genes that regulate development. Yet from this conserved set, fishes come in an amazing diversity of shapes. Pipefish are part of a group of nearly 300 species that also includes seahorses, pipehorses, and seadragons, that have remarkably diverse traits such as long snouts, tube-like bodies, and males that become pregnant. These fishes provide a unique opportunity to study trait evolution because of the breadth of characters absent in other fish lineages and the existence of powerful experimental tools based on the pipefish genomic. This project will involve the research training of an undergraduate from groups underrepresented in science. It will also contribute to public outreach in collaboration with The Museum of Natural and Cultural History at the University of Oregon.<br/><br/>This project will connect observed genetic and genomic changes with the morphological changes to the body plan in the Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli). This research focuses on a small subset of Hox transcription factors and their surrounding genomic content that are important in early cranial and axial skeleton development. Based on analysis of the Gulf pipefish genome, a few key Hox genes and nearby regulatory elements have been lost through the course of evolution in the Gulf pipefish lineage. Using advanced genomic and gene editing techniques, the researchers will perform functional tests in related teleost fish, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), to examine the morphological impact of the loss of genes and genomic content on the fish body plan. Possible effects of these losses on the evolution of the syngnathid body plan will be determined by creating mutations in these orthologous genes using the CRISPR technique in zebrafish and threespine stickleback fish models. This work will advance our understanding of how novel characters evolve in the context of the deeply conserved developmental toolkit."

The overarching goal is to maximize the efficiency by which complex, three-dimensional molecules are prepared by using new reagents and reactions discovered in his laboratory.  Such an approach reduces the time, energy, and cost associated with synthesizing complex molecules composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms.  Many such molecules are biologically active, and so they can be employed as molecular probes to better understand biochemical pathways or as therapeutics to be used in medicine.  Beyond the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, the broader impacts of this project touch the fields of organic chemistry (e.g., total synthesis, synthetic methodology), chemical biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and medicine.<br/><br/>N-Sulfinyl metallodienamines (NSMDs) have emerged as powerful asymmetric synthons for chemical synthesis.  The focus of this project is to determine both the mechanism and scope of reactions using acyclic NSMDs with a variety of electrophiles, which logically builds from previous efforts on arene-fused congeners.  Specifically, in Aim 1 the researchers are studying the scope of the reactions of acyclic NSMDs with electrophilic olefins to afford cycloadducts through a Domino Michael/Mannich (formal Diels-Alder) process.  In Aim 2, the research group is applying optimal reaction conditions determined from Aim 1 toward the step-efficient, asymmetric total syntheses of complex Iboga alkaloids (+)-catharanthine, (+)-coronaridine, and (+)-ibogamine.  In Aim 3, the research students are systematically investigating the reactions of NSMDs with aldehydes (vinylogous aldol) and imines (vinylogous Mannich). In Aim 4, researchers are probing the reactions of NSMDs with electrophilic oxygen and nitrogen sources to access alpha-functionalized N-sulfinyl imines, which can be further modified to access chiral building blocks for organic synthesis.  Computer modeling is used in all mechanistic analyses.  Professor Andrade has demonstrated a strong commitment to the inclusion of undergraduates, particularly from underrepresented groups, in his research activities."

While the possibilities are many, there are also doubts about how far these methods will go - and what new theoretical foundations may be required to take them to the next level overcoming possible hurdles. Recently, machine learning has undergone a paradigm shift with increasing reliance on  stochastic optimization to train highly non-convex models -- including but not limited to deep nets. Theoretical understanding has lagged behind, primarily because most problems in question are provably intractable on worst-case instances. Furthermore, traditional machine learning theory is mostly concerned with classification, whereas much practical success is driven by unsupervised learning and representation learning. Most past theory of representation learning was focused on simple models such as k-means clustering and PCA, whereas  practical work uses vastly more complicated models like autoencoders, restricted Boltzmann machines and deep generative models. The proposal presents an ambitious agenda for extending theory to embrace and support these practical trends, with hope of influencing practice. Theoretical foundations will be provided for the next generation of machine learning methods and optimization algorithms. <br/><br/>The project may end up having significant impact on  practical machine learning, and even cause a cultural change in the field -- theory as well as practice -- with long-term ramifications. Given the ubiquity as well as  economic and scientific implications of machine learning today, such impact will extend into other disciplines, especially in (ongoing) collaborations with researchers in neuroscience. The project will train a new generation of machine learning researchers, through an active teaching and mentoring plan at all levels, from undergrad to postdoc. This new generation will be at ease combining cutting edge theory and applications. There is a pressing need for such people today, and the senior PIs played a role in training/mentoring several existing ones.<br/> <br/>Technical contributions will include new theoretical models of knowledge representation and semantics, and also frameworks for proving convergence of nonconvex optimization routines. Theory will be developed to explain and exploit the interplay between representation learning and supervised learning that has proved so empirically successful in deep learning, and seems to underlie new learning paradigms such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and interactive learning. Attempts will be made to replace neural models with models with more ""interpretable""  attributes and performance curves.  All PIs have a track record of combining theory with practice. They  are also devoted to a heterodox research approach, borrowing from all the past phases of machine learning: interpretable representations from the earlier phases (which relied on logical representations, or probabilistic models), provable guarantees from the middle phase (convex optimization, kernels etc.), and an embrace of nonconvex methods from the latest deep net phase. Such eclecticism is uncommon in machine learning, and may give rise to new paradigms and new kinds of science."

Native American languages are valuable because, among other things, they contain diverse grammatical features that language scientists have only just begun understanding and analyzing. Yet, all Native American languages are endangered, and many of these languages are no longer spoken or used by fluent first language speakers. It is in the national interest to broaden participation by training Native linguists who are familiar with the culture and communities in which these languages reside; these linguists bring their diverse knowledge and experience to the language sciences, and can more directly help with grassroots language revitalization efforts in their home communities, at least some of which is funded by other federal initiatives. Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), such as Sitting Bull College (Standing Rock Indian Reservation), are often spaces in which these grassroots language revitalization efforts take place. Moreover, many community members are motivated to learn their ancestral language, despite a dearth of indigenous linguists.  This project will leverage that motivation to facilitate a better linguistic and structural understanding of a Native American language by TCU faculty and students. Broader impacts include increasing representation of Native Americans in the social sciences, capacity building in linguistics at a TCU, and improved training of TCU participants in second language acquisition and assessment methodologies. This project is co-funded by the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).<br/><br/>Sitting Bull College's Lakota Language Capacity Building Initiative hypothesizes that community members often may not know how linguists can help their language revitalization efforts because they do not get to see the processes involved in creating programs, materials, or other resources that help revitalize language. Similarly, community members may not know if they want to participate in language sciences, as language sciences are not usually introduced to students in primary or secondary schools, and are also not always taught or included in language-learner environments and other language revitalization activities. The team will investigate how the development of a deeper and more explicit connection of the language sciences to Lakota language revitalization activities and language learning fosters interest in the language sciences by TCU faculty and students. The Initiative will ramp up existing Sitting Bull College language courses to speed-up Lakota language acquisition among the college's students and staff and in the greater Standing Rock community. Datives, conditional clauses, adverbial clauses of time and other morphologically or syntactically complex structures are used in basic daily conversations, so learners are confronted with them regularly. This project will document these grammatical elements in the speech of both fluent speakers and learners, creating a rich corpus of second language acquisition data in addition to the documentation of fluent Lakota speakers.  The strength of the proposed initiative is that it helps students develop a better understanding of the possibilities and limits of the language sciences by teaching the Lakota language in a multitude of ways, such as through grammars, archival materials, as well as through interaction with fluent speakers.  By developing student proficiency in and metalinguistic awareness of the Lakota language, this initiative aims to create groups of passionate Lakota language learners who will not only continue to learn and use Lakota in everyday life, but who will also build Sitting Bull College's capacity as a center for Lakota language research and acquisition."

Stormwater runoff carries pollutants that are discharged in natural waterbodies. One pollutant of concern for water quality in coastal cities is reactive nitrogen. Although a nutrient and vital for life on Earth, when found in excess in aquatic environments nitrogen may lead to algal blooms, negatively impacting surface water bodies which are sources for drinking water, recreation and the fishing industry.  A technology used to treat stormwater runoff is bioretention, which consists of a shallow depression with native plants and a series of permeable layers including sand and gravel where the water is filtered and pollutants are degraded. Additional advantages of bioretention are reduced flooding, improved groundwater recharge and increases green space. The purpose of this project is to study bioretention systems for nitrogen removal in an urban coastal city. The researcher will be working at the National University of Singapore, where research on the development of bioretention systems for sustainable stormwater management is being conducted.  The research will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Hu Jiangyong, an expert on water technologies. Singapore is the third most densely populated nation in the world and flashfloods are common during the rainy season and stormwater and nutrient management is crucial for their livelihood and water quality.<br/><br/>Nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient and therefore challenging to fully remove from the aqueous phase. Biological, physical, and chemical processes that take place in bioretention systems can contribute to the removal of nitrogen. Moreover, bioretention systems need to be designed to promote nitrification and denitrification to successfully remove nitrogen from the aqueous phase and return it to the atmosphere as dinitrogen, N2 (g). The researcher will study how the geographical context of different precipitation events and local materials found in Singapore contribute to nitrogen removal in bioretention compared to systems being studied in the U.S. Storm events that were performed in Tampa, FL in a denitrifying bioretention system will be replicated in a bioretention system in Singapore. Total nitrogen removal data will be compared for both systems. These comparison studies will provide a deeper insight on how the media type and environmental parameters of precipitation impact nitrogen removal. The new knowledge gained will contribute to improvements in bioretention design and overall water quality for coastal cities around the world. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

The results of studies using this equipment will help businesses and organizations make informed decisions about what communication and collaboration tools will best support their mission.  The results will also lead to new tools that individuals can use to manage their own stress levels and maximize their performance.<br/><br/>This project will develop a laboratory for research on next generation computer-mediated and computer-enhanced teamwork and group interaction that will allow investigators to capture complex relationships among technology, individual cognitive and affective states, and team dynamics.  The infrastructure will support a broad range of forward-looking research activities by Cornell faculty and students working in areas such as human computer interaction, computer-mediated communication, computer-supported cooperative work, virtual and augmented reality, social computing, and human-robot interaction.  The infrastructure will support both the fine-grained measurement of human responses (e.g., heart rate, eye gaze, body movement) and the development and evaluation of new social computing tools that draw on these fine grained measures, such as 'just in time' interventions.  It will allow investigators to ask new research questions that can only be answered by capturing complex interrelationships among technology, individual cognitive and affective states, and team dynamics. Investigators will also be able to design and test new types of computational tools that draw on the psychophysiological, gaze and body position data provided by the infrastructure."

Complex chemical processes that are not well represented in climate models and are a source of large uncertainties in climate assessments produce sOAs. In particular the oxidation of organic gases by water in cloud drops is recognized to be important but there are limited studies to represent the processes that produce the particles and their properties. The proposed work will measure and quantify the persistence of these aqueous SOA particles by measuring their volatility in the laboratory and their inclusion in climate models will enable more robust assessments. <br/><br/>In order to constrain aqueous SOA (aqSOA) production mechanism this research would experimentally quantify the volatility of aqSOA compounds that determine the low volatility fraction that survive evaporation and scavenging to effect global climate. The goal is to probe the fundamental relationship between the precursor molecular properties and aqSOA volatility. The laboratory studies will elucidate aqSOA-volatility relationships from (1) methylglyoxal, pyruvic acid, and methyl-vinyl ketone oxidation, (2) oxidation products in precipitation samples and (3) dried organic aerosol oxidation. The oxidation will be performed by hydroxyl radicals produced from hydrogen peroxide photolysis in a batch reactor, the mixtures will be aerosolized with a vibration orifice aerosol generator then evaporated in a flow tube and finally detected by an optical particle counter. Polarity-resolved volatility distributions will be measured using elution and ion chromatography. The results will elucidate the fundamental volatility properties of aqSOA to understand how they effect past, present and future climate."

Episodes of severe ocean warming linked to climate change has driven largescale declines of coral populations in many tropical and subtropical regions. While many symbioses are susceptible to heat stress, various species and colonies appear unaffected visually, spurring many investigations into learning the underlying biological attributes that explain this resistance. The persistence and growth of Symbiodinium and host coral requires trace metals which are essential to vital processes such as photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation. Previous studies have shown that the availability of trace metals, most notably iron, influences marine phytoplankton growth and assists in stress responses. The possibility that trace metal availability affects resistance to thermal stress in symbiotic corals is currently unexplored. The host scientist, Dr. Tung-Yuan Ho (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) recently described the trace metal requirements for growth by Symbiodinium kawagutii finding that increased iron availability was positively correlated with algal growth. To build upon this study, this project will expand upon this study by evaluating iron requirements among distantly and closely-related species of Symbiodinium and capitalize upon my access to Dr. Ho's trace metal clean laboratory. Knowledge of iron requirements for a diversity of Symbiodinium species (in culture) will lay the foundation for future investigation on whether the availability and subsequent acquisition of iron affects corals in symbiosis during periods of thermal stress.<br/><br/>During this experiment, ten species of Symbiodinium will be grown in ambient conditions and exposed to various trace iron concentrations. Growth rates will be quantified and compared using cell density. To determine the iron requirement of Symbiodinium spp., cellular iron levels will be quantified using elemental analysis at multiple points during the growth experiment. Examining how trace iron availability alters the growth kinetics of numerous Symbiodinium species will determine whether iron requirements follow phylogenetic patterns and are unique in hot- and cold-water adapted Symbiodinium spp.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan."

Coalescence (a destabilization process where two liquid droplets merge to form single, larger droplet) is an undesirable limiting factor for implementing these delivery systems within the foregoing commercial applications. Therefore, systematic investigations which improve current understanding of the dynamic processes that lead to droplet coalescence are crucially important. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Patrick Spicer, an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia and a noted expert on the production of shaped and targeted droplet delivery systems.<br/><br/>The objective of this EAPSI project is to elucidate how nanoparticle-surfactant mixtures adsorbed to oil-water interfaces impact the interfacial rheology and observed coalescence behavior between neighboring oil-in-water droplets. It has been hypothesized that the presence of surfactants in Pickering (particle stabilized) emulsions can significantly modify particle interactions at the oil-water interface and thus improve an emulsion's resistance to coalescence dynamics. This theory will be explored for oil-in-water Pickering emulsions stabilized by silica nanoparticles (~500 nm dia.) and lecithin (one of the most widely used surfactants for the delivery of active compounds). Characterization of the co-adsorption and interfacial rheology of silica nanoparticles and lecithin molecules at the oil-water interface will be studied using pendant drop tensiometry procedures developed at Purdue University. Direct observation of dynamic coalescence processes between micrometer-scale oil droplets at relevant timescales (<1 ms) will be conducted using custom micromanipulation equipment, optical microscopy, and high-speed imaging capabilities available through collaboration with Prof. Patrick Spicer at the University of New South Wales.

More recently, the technique has been extended to diagnosing and treatment planning of certain medical problems such as congenital and acquired cardiovascular diseases, and to the design and optimization of medical devices. Solving the fluid-structure interaction problems on supercomputers with a large number of processor cores is challenging because the mathematical model consists of a coupled complicated nonlinear system, and most existing algorithms and software for the solution of problems of this kind do not scale well beyond a few hundred processor cores. The principal investigator will develop highly scalable algorithms and software that are suitable for large scale supercomputers and  applicable for different models of blood flows and material parameters for the arterial wall. <br/> <br/>Mature technologies are available for solving many types of linear problems, but for coupled, highly nonlinear multi-physics problems, robust and scalable techniques are badly needed, especially for implementation on large scale parallel computers. The technical focus of this project is a class of non-linearly preconditioned Newton methods that combines a nonlinear elimination technique with multilevel domain decomposition for parallelization. Through this research the principal investigator will solve non-linear difficult problems modeling a wide range of physical models with different levels of non-linearities. Algorithms that provide a high degree of parallelism will be designed so that large scale parallel computers can be used efficiently.  The target application is a family of fluid-structure interaction problems in biomechanics. For the fluid model, both Newtonian and non-Newtonian models will be studied. For solid models, linear elasticity will be considered for small deformations,  geometric nonlinear elasticity will be considered for large deformations, and hyper-elasticity will be considered for materially nonlinear problems. Two- and many-level versions of the algorithms will be investigated to obtain high scalability on parallel computers with a large number of processor cores.  This research will have a great impact in areas of computational science and engineering where non-linear difficult problems need to be solved. The research is rich in opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in applications in biomechanics, parallel computing, and general computational science and engineering."

A recent example of slope failure, which transformed into a fast-moving volcanic debris flow, occurred without warning on the flanks of Te Maari volcano on the North Island of New Zealand in 2012. Modern satellite imagery of the volcano suggests the slopes are weak due to the circulation of hot groundwater. The project will investigate the geology of the slopes to test the accuracy of satellite data interpretations. By completing detailed geochemical analyses of samples collected from the targeted slopes, the researcher will be able to determine to what extent these volcanic slopes are unstable and unsafe. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ben Kennedy, a noted expert of volcanic processes, at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The results will not only aid in understanding the 2012 Te Maari slope failure but will provide important information about the accuracy of satellite data on unstable volcanic slopes, which can be applied worldwide. <br/><br/>Both LIDAR data and field studies indicate that hydrothermally altered clasts are present in the debris flow deposit. Additionally, hyperspectral data now reveals ongoing alteration of the volcano, and provides a unique opportunity to study and sample these volcanic flanks. With these samples and hyperspectral and LIDAR data, the researcher will accomplish the following objectives: (1) determine the amount and style of hydrothermal alteration from the slopes that failed and produced the 2012 Te Maari debris avalanche using modern geochemistry techniques; (2) interpret remote sensing data to test whether it can accurately identify composition and textures at Te Maari; (3) apply remote sensing techniques to other volcanoes in the region to assess slope failure hazards. The results of this research will provide a framework to identify and classify hydrothermal alteration on other steep volcanic slopes, where high-resolution remote sensing data is available. In addition to a new framework for how to identify unstable slopes on steep volcanoes with satellite data, this work will improve hazard assessment and mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

Striking cross-national differences exist in children's math and science abilities, with children in South Korea ranking in the top 10 in both subject areas. Already by kindergarten, South Korean children outperform children from various countries on tasks of spatial skill. These findings suggest the Korean advantage in spatial skills, and later math and science, might be rooted in early home experiences. Research is limited and needed on the development of children's spatial skills in nations that rank in the top 10 in math and science. Such research can inform educational practices and policy aiming to promote STEM development in children. Therefore, this project will: 1) examine the spatial skills of South Korean 3- and 4-year olds by developing and adapting new measures and 2) investigate how children's home environments (e.g., spatial toys like blocks and puzzles) and interactions with their parents relate to these skills. The project will be conducted at Seoul National University, the most highly ranked research university in South Korea, in collaboration with Dr. Keumjoo Kwak, who has expertise in how parental practices and home environments affect Korean preschoolers' academic success.<br/><br/>South Korean children surpass U.S. children in STEM areas by 7 and 8 years. To date, STEM research on Korean children has focused on early number skills. However, there is a dearth of research on the development of Korean children's spatial skills, which may partially explain South Korean children's aptitude in STEM areas. The first aim is to describe individual differences in spatial skill among South Korean 3- and 4-year olds. The study will extend research to an understudied population, age, and domain of cognitive development foundational to STEM performance: spatial skills of mental translation, rotation, and so on. A second aim is to examine South Korean parents? spatial language and spatial activities with children (e.g., block play) and relate these practices to children's spatial skill. The project will develop and adapt a battery of spatial skill assessments for children; new measures and procedures for assessing parent-child interactions around spatial concepts; and measures of parents' attitudes and beliefs about STEM disciplines (through videorecorded interactions, questionnaires, direct assessments of children). Findings will advance knowledge on the practices that best promote the development of early spatial skills and performance in STEM areas. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Developing a STEM teacher recruitment, preparation, and induction model with collaboration between an undergraduate liberal arts college, a graduate school of education, a local community college, and a large urban school district is an important step in addressing the national shortage of well-prepared STEM teachers, particularly those that come from groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields. The model ensures that future STEM teachers have the content knowledge and pedagogical skills needed to succeed in today's diverse classrooms using a combination of scholarship support, rigorous academic courses and lab-based STEM research opportunities, meaningful and supported early classroom experiences, and mentoring at all points of their preparation and early careers as teachers. <br/><br/>The project is a partnership between Lewis & Clark College's College of Arts and Sciences (LC CAS), and Graduate School of Education and Counseling (LC GSEC), Portland Community College (PCC), and Portland Public Schools (PPS) and aims to build the framework for a STEM Teacher Pathways Program and design a scholarship model that will eventually engage four to five additional STEM preservice teachers per year in the LC GSEC Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. At the conclusion of this Capacity Building project, a plan will have been developed for the recruitment, preparation, and induction of a more diverse cohort of STEM teachers. Key features of the plan include: an articulation agreement that allows for the seamless transfer of credits from PCC to LC CAS; the availability of scholarships for PCC transfer students as well as other STEM teacher candidates; opportunities for LC CAS undergraduate students to conduct research with STEM faculty, and to be mentored by LC GSEC STEM teacher candidates; and an induction and mentoring plan designed to support new STEM teachers once they begin teaching. These features create a pathway that will increase the number and diversity of candidates who complete an MAT in STEM Teacher Education and are hired and retained as teachers in local and other schools.  This program will draw from students majoring in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Mathematics, and Physics.  Ultimately, this program should lead to increased recruitment and retention of STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds, increased success for their students, and, ideally, a society of scientific literacy for all."

Nanoscience is critical to many high-technology and manufacturing industries in Utah, and the state is faced with a rising need for skilled workers in this field. In response to the urgent workforce need in local industries, Utah Valley University (UVU) will develop curricula to train students in nanotechnology principles. A nanotechnology course and associated modules will be developed for community college students and other introductory-level undergraduate students. The course will include design projects and laboratories using innovative environmentally-friendly fabrication techniques. Advanced virtual-reality game techniques will be used to promote students' understanding and visualization of the underlying physics concepts and the methods used to build very small-scale structures. The new course will also serve as a springboard for students intending to pursue advanced degrees in nanotechnology. The project will enhance the preparation of students, increase the number of skilled technicians, and help strengthen the regional workforce.<br/><br/>This project will implement an introductory nanotechnology course that aligns with rapidly changing industry requirements, develop new tools for nanotechnology education, and complement existing associate and bachelor degree programs at UVU. The course will include a series of modules and projects, as well as laboratories that feature a novel water-based technique for photolithography which avoids the hazardous solvents of conventional methods. This improved method for photolithographic fabrication will contribute a potentially transformative methodology for both education and industry, and contribute to the knowledge base about the effectiveness of virtual learning environments in education. The laboratory experience also includes thin film fabrication using auto-catalytic metallization, and scanning electron microscopy for both characterization and electron beam lithography. Virtual-reality learning modules with high-fidelity simulation of various experimental methods and processes will also be incorporated into the course. These virtual-reality techniques will allow students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes without the disadvantage of depleting resources or trying to assemble flawed designs in the laboratory. The virtual-reality modules will also provide an effective alternative in circumstances where advanced equipment may not be available. The format of this nanotechnology course will facilitate adoption and adaptation at other institutions. The resources and practices from the project will be shared through a project website and through professional development workshops for educators. Summer programs for high school students, with an emphasis on groups underrepresented in STEM fields, will incorporate virtual-reality educational games and simplified lab experiments from the course to expose and engage students in nanotechnology."

Such systems could emulate brain-like function and lead to transformative changes in how we do computation and store data. Such approaches have stringent requirements for materials which are not readily available today. These include materials that can exhibit multiple, precisely and uniquely addressable ""microstates"" based on an intrinsic feature of that material which must not fluctuate or degrade significantly over time. Identifying suitable materials that can function in this manner remains a foremost challenge. This project explores ferroelectric materials, which are intrinsic stable and fast, but have traditionally exhibited only binary (not multi-state) function to find new routes to create multi-state function. This project provides new fundamental understanding of materials that are important for a range of applications, expands our knowledge of how to synthesize and control complex, candidate materials critical for a range of next-generation applications, provides foundation understanding for novel technological development including potential impact on neuromorphic, metamaterial, logic/memory, and energy transduction applications, and trains and educates a modern workforce in cutting-edge materials and experimental approaches while deepening our abilities to synthesize/fabricate complex materials thereby enabling new intellectual property and entrepreneurial endeavors.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The ability to access multiple configuration states (i.e., going beyond binary) in materials will enable transformative changes in how we do computation and store data. Neuromorphic computing architectures (designed to emulate neuron function in the brain) require materials exhibiting multiple, precisely and uniquely addressable ""microstates"" based on a readable macroscopic order parameter which does not fluctuate or degrade significantly over time. New adaptable materials are required to enable such transformative technologies. Identifying suitable materials - structures, chemistries, morphologies and stochasticities - that enable true neuromorphic (multi-state) principles remains a foremost challenge. This program explores aspects of fundamental materials design, control, and understanding through an innovative combination of advanced materials synthesis, fabrication, and characterization to enable novel, multi-state function in intrinsically bi-stable ferroelectric materials. The research investigates routes to transition from stochastic to deterministic production of non-volatile multi-states by understanding how to control the polarization, electrostatic, gradient, elastic, and other energies in ferroelectrics. This is achieved by 1) using epitaxial growth to produce complex, multi-ground state domain architectures wherein long-range collective interactions enable multiple states; 2) developing designer strain and energy landscapes that enable non-volatile, multi-state stability in chemically-inhomogeneous films; and 3) synthesis and application of electric field and stress to induce multi-state configurations based on defect-polarization coupling. The research provides foundational insights about the nature of ferroelectricity and how polarization can be controlled, how to produce complex, multi-component materials with ever-increasing precision, how ferroelectric switching evolves in systems, and how multi-state function can be achieved in solid-state materials. This project additional provides for training and education of high-tech researchers, research opportunities for underrepresented student groups, and could enable technologies of importance to a range of important technical fields."

These enzymes are used to sequentially remove the N1-, N3, and N7-methyl groups from the caffeine molecule. This N-demethylation process can result in a new, economical, and environmentally-friendly method to produce valuable methylxanthies from caffeine. NdmA and NdmB perform the first two steps by removing the N1-methyl group followed by the N3-methyl group, respectively. NdmCDE form a large protein complex to carry out the N7-demethylation of 7-methylxanthine to xanthine. We have created several mutant N-demethylase enzymes with improved abilities to produce high-value metabolites from caffeine, but the yields of these metabolites are still low. Crystal structures of the mutant caffeine-degrading enzymes with the metabolites they degrade will be determined under the mentorship of Dr. Hyun Kyu Song of Korea University. The crystal structures will provide insight into rationally designing new mutant enzymes to increase the yield of high-value biochemicals from this process. Dr. Song's research group is the only one to determine the structure of the N-demethylase enzymes to date. The Song lab, thus, has all of the protocols and equipment necessary to complete this project. <br/><br/>The N-demethylation of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) can provide valuable methylxanthines in an economical, environmentally-friendly method compared to the current chemical synthesis. Paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine) is produced as a minor product through the N3-demethylation of caffeine due to slight promiscuity of the N1-demethylase NdmA toward the N3-methyl group. The N3-demethylase NdmB catalyzes the conversion of theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) to 7-methylxanthine, but exhibits very low activity toward molecules that contain an N1-methyl group. Mutants of NdmA and NdmB have been created to better understand the substrate interactions with the enzymes. The hypothesis of this work is that the mutation of two residues in the NdmA active site to those found at similar locations in NdmB will swap the NdmA activity from N1-demethylation to N3-demethylation, resulting in higher yields of paraxanthine. Under the direction of Dr. Song, the researcher will determine the crystal structures of these mutants with their substrates and discover the substrate orientation in the enzyme to ultimately optimize the yield of paraxanthine. Additionally, the project will also seek to determine the crystal structure of the native NdmCDE complex. The knowledge gained through these crystallographic studies will enable rational engineering of bacterial N-demethylase enzymes and accelerate the biosynthesis of high-value methylxanthines for applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

The aim is to study the interplay of temperature and drought in the past, for clues to their probable connections in the future. <br/><br/>The main purpose of the project is to create a map of changes in the sizes of ancient lakes in the central Andes, giant ancestors to modern lakes in the region such as Lake Titicaca. Well-preserved shorelines mark the extent of these ancient lakes, and using state-of-the art techniques, the age of these features can be determined. The mapping and dating is vital to relating lake size (and therefore rainfall amounts in the past) to the changing temperature state of the planet, which is well known from other records.

An important part of three-dimensional topology is also the study of knots, or in other words, loops embedded in some tangled way in three-manifolds. The solution of a well-known problem known as Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture has established that three-manifolds, and complements of knots in them, decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries. One of the most common and most interesting geometries thatappearin this setting is hyperbolic geometry. In practice, three-manifolds are often given in terms of combinatorial topological descriptions and it is both natural and important to seek for ways to deduce geometric information from thesedescriptions.One of the ways that topologists have been approaching the study of three-manifolds is through the construction and study of objects called invariants.In the last few decades, ideas that originated in quantum physics have led mathematicians to thediscovery of a variety of subtle and powerful invariants of knots and three-manifolds.Understanding the connections of topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants to detailed geometric structures, arising from Thurston's picture,is a central and important goal of low dimensional topology.The main theme of this project is to establish such connections and to explore their ramifications and applications to topology as well as other areas ofmathematics.<br/><br/>The project aims to establish intrinsic connections between geometry and topological descriptions, properties, and quantum invariants of links and three-manifolds. One part of the project will continue the PI's study of the relations between Jones-type link polynomials, the topology of essential surfaces in link complements and hyperbolic geometry. Another part, will study the Turaev-Viro three-manifold invariants, their relations to other quantum invariants and the connections of their asymptotics to hyperbolic geometry. A third part will develop methods for recognizing geometric structures on three-manifolds from purely combinatorial input, and derive estimates on geometric quantities from topological data. A fourth part will study skein link theory in three-manifolds, its invariants, and its interaction with geometric decompositions of 3-manifolds.

Chemical cues signal the presence of food, mates, predators, and toxic substances, and animals are attracted, repelled, or indifferent to individual odors. However, the responses of animals to chemicals are not fixed, but can be altered by their past experience and current state. For example, prolonged prior exposure to an odor decreases subsequent responses to that chemical, and juveniles and adults can exhibit different responses to chemicals. This flexibility ensures that the animal exhibits the behavior that is most appropriate for its current condition. The overall goal of this project is to explore how an animal's experience and its developmental stage alter the functions of the nervous system to drive different chemical-sensing behaviors. Given the importance of smell and taste in animal lifecycles, this work allows us to begin to explore how changes in the environment may impact animal welfare, and aid in animal husbandry and conservation efforts. The proposed work supports the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, and all efforts will be made to involve members of underrepresented minority groups. The project also builds research relationships between university labs and high school students and teachers. The insights from this work are shared with the public via hands-on demonstrations at local science museums and science fairs. The proposed work also incorporates collaborations among biologists, chemists and bioengineers, and is thus expected to promote interdisciplinary learning and innovation.<br/><br/>Both innate and learned behaviors are flexible, and are extensively modulated by an animal's experience as well as its external and internal state. The specific goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecules, neurons, and circuits that mediate context- and developmental stage-specific plasticity in chemosensory behavioral responses of the nematode C. elegans. Preliminary experiments suggest that contextual cues modulate the output of antagonistic neural circuits to toggle the response to a simple alcohol between attraction and aversion. The behavioral strategies and neuronal mechanisms underlying this response flexibility is characterized using high-resolution analyses of behavioral states and neuronal activity under defined conditions. C. elegans chemosensory behaviors are also dramatically modulated as a function of developmental stage and environmental experience. The proposed research characterizes this experience- and stage-dependent chemosensory behavioral plasticity, and identifies the required neuronal and molecular mechanisms. Results from this work provide new information about the mechanisms by which animals efficiently alter their behaviors in response to changing external and internal conditions."

From galaxies and galaxy clusters to the solar system, including the Sun and our own planet, magnetic fields are found nearly everywhere we look. Their ubiquitous presence is not passive; rather, magnetic fields are key players in the dynamics and shape of the observable universe. Such phenomena can have significant societal implications here on Earth, as illustrated by the case of solar flares. Solar flares are dramatic manifestations of magnetic activity in the Sun that impact directly space weather and may catastrophically affect the national electric power grid. Therefore understanding the mechanisms responsible for cosmic magnetic fields is an important challenge in plasma physics. This landscape provides a fertile area of research and training for students. This project will lead to the development of novel analytical theoretical methods and state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations.    <br/><br/>This project will focus on reassessing the importance of the initial magnetic fields that are required to seed any dynamo. In the usual paradigm, the conventional assumption is that these arise via the Biermann battery. Such fields are system-size and weak. In collisionless plasmas, however, recent ab initio results suggest that an altogether different paradigm may be more appropriate; indeed,  numerical simulations show that the configuration that gives rise to the Biermann fields becomes prey to the electron Weibel instability. The seed fields that ensue are radically different from those of Biermann origin: they are fairly strong, and live at scales close to the electron skin-depth. This result thus points to a different scenario: the plasma dynamo problem may not, in fact, be as much about amplitude as it is about scale: can electron-scale fields, under the combined action of their own nonlinear evolution and background turbulence, give rise to a large scale field at equipartition levels? Assessing how such seed fields evolve and, critically, whether a plasma dynamo seeded in this fashion may indeed exist, is the key goal in this project."

The last 20 years have seen significant advancement in understanding of how to create effective learning environments for STEM education. While many individual faculty have adopted new approaches to teaching, change has not been deep or widespread enough to make a major impact across all of STEM education. Better understanding is needed of how faculty can become change agents in order to effect this change. This study focuses on exploring the experiences of early career engineering education faculty as they attempt to impact the engineering education experiences of students locally and more broadly. Engineering education faculty are unique in that they have formal training in the types of change desired, and are often embedded in disciplinary engineering departments where they can apply their knowledge to create change. Understanding their experiences and the academic cultures in which they are working will provide information on they can and cannot influence education practices in their departments. Doing so will enhance our efforts to train and develop faculty prepared to drive change in engineering education.<br/><br/>In the first phase of a two-phase study, collaborative inquiry and collaborative autoethnography methods will be used to systematically examine the PIs' own experiences as six early career faculty members in diverse settings: this will include scrutinizing acceptance of ambiguity, responses to disappointments and challenges, willingness to adapt, and ability to collaborate. Subsequently, in the second phase, the experiences of 12-15 additional early career faculty members will be examined to refine and expand on the phase one results, increasing their applicability to multiple settings. The results of this project will (1) advance the engineering education community's understanding of existing structures for facilitating change (or the lack thereof) in engineering education (2) identify barriers and supports for making change as early career engineering education faculty; and (3) develop a co-constructed understanding of how to better prepare and support faculty to exercise agency as it relates to impacting engineering education during their first few years in academic positions. These advancements are critical because the calls for change in engineering education will continue as technological advances are made and the role of engineers in society continues to evolve. By identifying the barriers and supports that affect early career faculty's abilities to take strategic and intentional actions towards achieving impact, the results of this study will enable engineering education graduate programs and national engineering education organizations to make programmatic changes to benefit future faculty. In addition, the evidence-based insights resulting from this study have the potential to expedite the on-boarding process of new engineering education faculty, promote improvements in STEM education nationally by faculty at all stages of their careers, and support the development of the field of engineering education research."

The GRC is one of the most highly<br/>acclaimed topical conferences in the field of physical metallurgy.  Held every two years, it provides a<br/>unique forum for in-depth discussion of cut-edging advances in the field and pathways to the future.  The<br/>associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) provides a forum for early career researchers and students to<br/>showcase their work and to participate at career discussions.  The GRS will be held on July 22-23, and the GRC<br/>will be on July 23-28, 2017, both at University of New England, Biddeford, Maine.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The field of Physical Metallurgy is currently seeing major changes in its research aims from qualitative<br/>understanding to quantitative predictive capability. This is largely driven by our ability to handle massive<br/>3D data describing the structure of materials, to locally evaluate materials properties, and to acquire<br/>systematic data series in high-throughput experiments. As 3D imaging is transitioning from technique<br/>development to application, it permits one to test modeling approaches at different levels of complexity<br/>and spatial resolution. Here, the direct modeling and simulation of experiments and the inverse modeling<br/>of the experimental results just begin to demonstrate their analytic power and their power to increase the<br/>accuracy of the measurements. Meanwhile, the classical core of the field, modeling of materials behavior<br/>and of structure-property relations, is still challenged by the difficulties to seamlessly transition between<br/>different modeling scopes from atoms to materials defects to continuum field equations. The frontiers of<br/>the field therefore are concerned with the systematization and the quantification of information on<br/>materials and with the assessment and increase of the predictive capability of the modeling and<br/>simulation. Modeling and simulation is beginning to provide thermodynamic information on materials in<br/>complex environments. Small scale experiments can be pushed to the scale of individual defects and can<br/>challenge modeling particularly concerning the mechanical properties of materials: fracture, fatigue,<br/>friction and wear. Additive manufacturing is posing new challenges to modeling and at the same time<br/>opens entirely new avenues to alloy development. The aim of this Gordon Conference is to assess these<br/>current frontiers of the field and to sketch central questions which the community will have to solve for<br/>Physical Metallurgy to advance as a field that spans from understanding atomistic processes on<br/>femtosecond time scales to assessing the behavior of structural components for years in service.<br/>"

However, as NoC architectures are scaled, they face serious challenges. A key challenge in addressing optimized NoC architecture design today is the plethora of performance enhancing, energy efficient and fault tolerant techniques available to NoC designers and the large design space that must be navigated to simultaneously reduce power, improve reliability, increase performance and maintain QoS. <br/><br/>This research proposes a new cross-layer, cross-cutting methodology spanning circuits, architectures, machine learning algorithms, and applications, aimed at designing energy-efficient, reliable and scalable NoCs. This research will result in (1) novel cross-layer design techniques that take a holistic approach of simultaneously reducing power consumption, while still achieving reliability and performance goals for NoCs, (2) a fundamental understanding of the use of hardware-amenable ML for NoC design optimization, (3) software and hardware techniques for monitoring and collecting critical data and key design parameters during network execution to optimize NoC design, and (4) modeling and simulation tools that will improve the architecture community's design methodologies for evaluating scalable NoCs. The proposed research bridges a very important gap between hardware architects who design power management and fault tolerant techniques at the circuit and architecture level and machine learning scientists who develop predictive and optimization techniques. Due to its cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential to significantly transform the design of next-generation CMPs and System-on-Chips (SoCs) where complex decisions have to be made that affect the power, performance and reliability. The research will also play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training. The PIs are committed and will continue to expand on outreach activities as part of the proposed project by making the necessary efforts to attract and train minority students in this field."

And how can designers create products that encourage adoption despite social and financial barriers? Understanding and modeling of user choice and behavior is common in engineering design efforts to predict market share, user preference, and optimal design for consumer products where purchase motivation is plentiful. Yet these valuable tools are less commonly, and notably less easily, applied to the design of products where user uptake is key to meeting public social, environmental, economic, and security goals. For example, smart and efficient appliances and vehicles can provide significant energy savings but may offer reduced convenience and be costly to the user. Yet these technologies will only have an impact if they are desirable and affordable enough to encourage adoption by a large fraction of users, and simultaneously perform well enough to meet the public goals of society at large. This delicate balance often is difficult to achieve due to the complex system of constraints, interrelated variables, conflicting objectives, and diverse market segments. The findings of this study will help designers to develop engineered products that are likely to achieve consumer adoption levels required to realize public goals. This project also will engage students through a unique course on rural household energy and related study-abroad opportunities. The course will cover issues addressed in this research and provide students experience with fieldwork techniques needed to understand rural and underserved communities. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to create and demonstrate a modeling framework that enables a more rigorous integration of consumer preference and public goal considerations into engineering design decisions. This will be achieved through a novel integration of techniques from user-centered design, computational social sciences, environmental psychology, usage context-based design, and agent-based modeling. The general framework will be demonstrated extensively in the context of designing household energy-related technologies. A multidisciplinary team of collaborators will combine new and existing real-world data with models of the current state of the user environment, technological options, potential actions and strategies, social norms, and utility functions to predict the consumer attitude, choice, and adoption behavior. This adoption model will be integrated into an existing systems-level model developed by the PI with prior NSF support to predict the outcomes of technological strategies in terms of a holistic set of objectives. Simulation results will inform engineering designers about the complex outcomes generated by various strategies across a community energy system."

This is true for pharmaceuticals commonly administered to patients, through to metal implants used in reconstructive surgery. These contacts between manmade materials and natural, biological systems are poorly understood, and difficult to probe and optimize. For example, medicines can have off-target effects, and implants can cause unwanted rejection or scarring. These interfaces must be better understood and optimized to correctly target tissues for better therapies. This project will develop new strategies for understanding how materials interact with cells. Specifically, to find fundamentally new methods for delivering gene based therapeutics to diseased tissues. Students will be exposed to a grand challenge in medicine, biology, materials science and chemistry, while working specifically on advanced polymers and biochemical screening techniques applicable to the study of many types of systems. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, the team seeks to impact both the field of biomaterials broadly, but also highlight the positive outcomes of working outside of normally well defined fields of study to bring different ways of approaching hard problems together in the lab to effect change. <br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Gianneschi and coworkers have developed nanoparticles that serve to protect DNA from enzymatic degradation while facilitating cellular entry and are able to modulate mRNA levels in live human cells with no appreciable toxicity.

However, as with many other biologically active nanomaterials, the mechanisms underlying, cellular uptake, endosome escape, mRNA regulation and nuclease resistance are not understood. This project's goal is to develop a universally applicable method that will allow researchers to understand the mechanisms involved in nanomaterial uptake by cells. This will also enable identification of potential bottlenecks that are associated with nanomaterial function and facilitate optimization of materials for downstream applications. Through a combination of advanced gene-editing tools and materials synthesis, new uptake pathways will be discovered, optimized, and then utilized to modulate gene expression allowing several routes towards treatment of disease including the sensitization of cells to therapies to which they are otherwise resistant.

The MJO is a special type of organized tropical convection systems which is distinct from others types by its vast horizontal spatial scale, subseasonal time scale, and eastward propagation over the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Enhanced or suppressed convection associated with the MJO affects global weather and climate, thereby providing a source of predictability in the subseasonal time scale. Therefore, understanding the essential dynamics and predictability of the MJO is key to improving subseasonal prediction in the tropics as well as MJO-related phenomena in the mid-latitude. The objectives of this study are to understand the predictability of the MJO and its impacts on predictability of high-impact weather events (such as extreme precipitation along the west coast). The main tasks are (i) to investigate the theoretical limit of the MJO, (ii) to investigate the physical processes for MJO propagation and the impact of the mean state change, and (iii) to examine the underlying mechanisms of the associations of MJO with extreme precipitation events. The research project will utilize satellite observations, reanalysis, and numerical experiments with a climate model.<br/><br/>Improving our understanding of subseasonal predictability will have global impacts on agriculture, commerce, healthcare, and food production. Better prediction of the MJO and related high-impact extreme precipitation events will provide policy makers, emergency managers, and other stakeholders with advanced warnings to prepare for mitigation measures. The goal of the educational activities is to increase diversity in atmospheric science by increasing the number of under-represented minority and women students. More specifically, the objectives are (i) to build strong collaborations with local community colleges in order to foster collaborative growth with their atmospheric science programs, (ii) to increase the number of under-represented minority students that transfer from community colleges to 4-year atmospheric science programs, and (iii) to culminate with their studies either into the atmospheric science workforce or graduate school. The educational activities will focus on enhancing computer programming skills and on improving research ability for under-represented minority and women students, thereby increasing diversity in the atmospheric science field."

Despite this massive impact on public health and food security, a limited number of drugs and chemicals are available to combat these parasites, and resistance to particular drugs is emerging. Novel approaches are therefore needed to control parasitic roundworms. Caenorhabditis elegans is a non-parasitic nematode that is studied by a large, robust research community which possesses a powerful collection of tools to study its biology. However there is historically limited interaction between the C. elegans community and the parasitology community. This workshop will bring together C. elegans biologists and parasitologists during the International C. elegans Meeting (to be held in Los Angeles, CA June 21-25th, 2017) in order to bridge these communities and to drive new approaches and collaborations to control parasitic roundworms. Funds will be used to support travel expenses for experts on parasitic roundworms, including female and underrepresented minority speakers, and to allow underrepresented minority students to attend and participate in this workshop as well as the rest of the C. elegans meeting.  <br/><br/>The primary objective of this conference is to educate and promote interactions and collaborations between the parasitic roundworm community and C. elegans researchers.  In particular, the goal is to increase awareness among C. elegans scientists of the issues and problems that parasitic roundworm researchers face, and pave the way for applying to parasitic roundworm studies the powerful approaches and technologies that have advanced C. elegans research. The upcoming International C. elegans Meeting provides the best opportunity to reach the majority of C. elegans researchers. A session will be organized at that meeting in which six experts on plant, animal and human parasitic nematodes speak on the life history and unique biology of parasitic species and on the outstanding issues in their field.  In addition to educating the C. elegans community, time will be provided for researchers in the two communities to interact.  The goal is to stimulate C. elegans researchers to think about problems facing the study and control of parasitic nematodes and to apply their expertise toward solving these problems.  To this end, a second, more informal event will be hosted after the session to provide opportunities for one-on-one conversations with the invited speakers. This workshop is unique, because it is embedded within the C. elegans biannual meeting, ensuring exposure to a large number of C. elegans investigators."

Hydrology in cities is very different from natural landscapes. Impervious surfaces, such as road and buildings, do not allow water to soak into the ground, resulting in higher amounts of surface runoff. Surface runoff from impervious surfaces, called stormwater, can cause flooding, pollute streams, and degrade downstream ecosystems. The goal of this project is to determine the flows of water in natural landscapes, then use these values as ""benchmarks"" for managing urban hydrology. If urban hydrology is able to replicate natural hydrology, the environmental problems associated with stormwater will be minimized. Prof. Tim Fletcher and Dr. Matthew Burns from the University of Melbourne will be hosting this research project. Prof. Fletcher and Dr. Burns are both experts in urban hydrology and stormwater management, and their research is well cited across the globe.<br/><br/>Hydrologists categorizes water movement into four general pathways: precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration (I), and surface runoff (R). The water balance equation is defined as P = ET + I + R. The first objective of this project is to determine the annual volumes of P, ET, I, and R for multiple watersheds in southeast Australia. Then, these values will be assigned as urban hydrologic benchmarks. For instance, the volume of water that infiltrates in natural watersheds should be matched in urban watersheds. The benefit of this project being conducted in southeast Australia is the semi-arid climate, which contrasts similar studies that are being conducted in humid regions. Understanding the different hydrologic patterns as a function of climate will inform stormwater engineers, city planners, and environmental regulators on how to set appropriate urban stormwater management goals for their respective locations. <br/>  <br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by the NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

CF is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), in which there are over 2000 different mutations. Currently, many of the medicines for CF are symptomatic treatments, used for airway clearance, preventing infection and inflammation, etc. while very few are used to treat the mutated CFTR protein itself. This work will investigate small molecules capable of binding to and stabilizing a region of the mutated protein, in hopes of improving current treatments used to do so. This will be done using both experimental and computational methods. This research will be conducted at Kwansei Gakuin University (KGU) under the advisement of Dr. Tsukasa Okiyoneda, an expert experimentalist in CF research. This collaboration provides access not only to Dr. Okiyoneda's knowledge-base, but also to the resources at KGU in which can be used to validate computational findings.<br/><br/>As stated, there are over 2000 mutations of CFTR. Of the 2000, the most common mutation is the F508 (F508-CFTR), which is a deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508. This F508 mutation exists in the NBD1 region of the protein. CFTR consists of five domains: membrane spanning domains 1 and 2 (MSD1/2), nuclear binding domains 1 and 2 (NBD1/2), and the regulatory domain (R). This research will focus on finding drugs and/or small molecules that can bind to the NBD1 region of CFTR and stabilize it. Computationally, programs such as Glide, ProBiS and LiSiCA will be used to predict binding sites and binding interactions with several compounds. The data received from the computational efforts will then be applied to experimental techniques by testing the compounds on purified protein from E. coli.  <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

This research will be conducted at Saga University under Dr. Hiroshi Kitagaki, a leading researcher on biotechnology and food science in Japan. Ultimately, because of the information planned to be gained in this research, the Saccharomyces clade as a model system will be a more comprehensive tool available for understanding yeast evolution and ecology. This EAPSI award promotes international collaboration as this project is poised for continuation of genomic investigations at the West Virginia University Genomic Core. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program ,supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

If these processes fail, the developing organism could have birth defects or may die. Much is known about the molecular signals that instruct cells to adopt certain roles or migrate to required places, but cells exist in complex environments, and it is not clear how the physical arrangement of tissues affects cell signaling to each other. Recent studies from the Principal Investigator's research group suggest that small gaps between cells may significantly affect both the diffusion of signals and cell movements.  The goal of this project is to characterize the effect of tissue shape on cell signaling and organ development.  The researchers will combine genetics, observation of signals in living tissues, and computer modeling. The signal mechanisms identified through this work should function similarly in the development of animals generally.  Thus, this project will advance our knowledge of fundamental biological mechanisms; in particular, the biophysical factors that govern development, including pattern formation, joint movements of cells, and regulation of cell-cell signals. The PI will integrate this research with her continued efforts in improving higher education in biology.  She will train undergraduate and graduate students in critical thinking and interdisciplinary research methods, expand participation of underrepresented individuals in science by partnering with existing programs, and engage in community outreach efforts. <br/><br/>Technical paragraph:<br/>To determine how tissue structure influences morphogenesis, the research team specifically investigates the Drosophila ovary.  Studying Drosophila has proven to be a powerful strategy to discover new genes and signaling mechanisms that function in many organisms, including humans. In the ovary, the epithelial-derived border cells become motile upon activation of the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway. During oogenesis, a diffusible activator is released from two follicle cells and functions to turn on STAT signaling in a dose-dependent fashion in nearby cells.  Activated cells migrate collectively toward high levels of secreted chemoattractants. Prior work suggests that these signaling events are regulated by conserved mechanisms. The project takes advantage of Drosophila genetics, mathematical modeling, and the relatively simple architecture of the developing egg, which can be imaged live to observe cell types interacting in vivo. Specifically, the researchers will: 1) investigate how the dynamics of a diffusible secreted signal are regulated, and how gaps within tissue architecture shape its signal transduction gradient and resultant cell specification, and 2) determine how the landscape of cells in the microenvironment through which the border cells migrate affects collective cell migration behaviors and local concentrations of secreted guidance cues.  Overall, this project will integrate cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research with outstanding educational opportunities for the next generation of potential scientists."

Some strategies take the form of overt and direct criticism of states to punish and deter repression of citizens, known as ""naming and shaming"".  Other strategies involve positive cooperation with governments to change legal and de facto protections of rights and freedoms. To date, we know little about which strategy is more effective, because systematic research on this topic has ignored direct collaboration between these organizations and states. Instead, there has been a recent explosion in the number of social science studies examining the efficacy of contentious strategies.  This research will provide new insight into whether such cooperative strategies are an effective means to improve human rights and social conditions.<br/> <br/>This project is the first to analyze the large-scale digital communications from human rights non-governmental organizations (HR NGOs) to understand the specific issues and contexts where cooperation can be successfully implemented. The researchers will demonstrate the usefulness of this approach through quantitative text analysis procedure analyzing a wide range of digitally available information (i.e. press releases, published reports, newsletters, and social media posts from multiple HR NGOs).  These are an especially rich source of information as they contain both cooperative and confrontational signals to states. The research team plans to build theoretically informed models that predict 1) the issues and circumstances that provide incentives for government-HR NGO partnerships versus public criticism known as ""naming and shaming,"" and 2) when particular HR NGO strategies ultimately lead to the desired changes in state behavior. This research has the potential to enhance the well-being of society by providing a better understanding of strategies that improve human rights performance around the world.  It is also poised to make an important contribution in helping to foster collaboration between the social sciences and other STEM disciplines."

Although the use of electronic embedded systems improves performance, driving comfort, safety, and economy for the customer; this electronic control of automotive systems makes these systems susceptible to permanent, transient, and intermittent electronic failures, which can significantly reduce the reliability and availability of these systems. In addition, recent work has demonstrated vulnerability of modern car control systems to security attacks that directly impact the automobile's physical safety and dependability. The novel aspect of this research program is the simultaneous integration of security and dependability while minimizing energy consumption and ensuring that real-time constraints of the application are not violated. The dependability and security approaches proposed in this project are also applicable to other CPS, such as transit vehicles, industrial automation, manned and unmanned air vehicles, and medical monitoring. Energy-efficient security and dependability integration, as pursued in this research program, further implies greater fuel-efficiency for combustion engine vehicles (in particular, aerial vehicles) and longer battery lifer for hybrid and electric vehicles.<br/><br/>To address the research challenge of simultaneous security and dependability integration while minimizing energy consumption, this research program proposes to leverage multicore ECUs to achieve high reliability with low energy-overhead for automotive safety-critical functions. The research program consists of two modular but inter-linked thrusts. In the first thrust, the project aims to develop a novel dependability methodology that would enable quick error detection and correction (QEDC) via an optimized combination of comparison-points and lightweight checkpointing to better meet the application's real-time constraints even in the presence of faults. The proposed dependability methodology aspires to attain energy-efficient fault tolerance by an intelligent use of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The second thrust aims to develop an integrated safety and security methodology that would integrate security primitives: confidentiality, integrity, and authentication over vehicular networks in an energy-efficient manner without violating the real-time constraints imposed by the maximum tolerable response time of cyber-physical applications. The project further aims to adapt safety and security parameters (e.g., number of comparison points for QEDC, number of checkpoints, key lengths for cryptographic algorithms and message authentication codes) to meet the application's real-time requirements under changing environmental stimuli (e.g., transient fault rate and vehicular bus load)."

Rapid advances have been made in this decade in the automated recognition of objects and faces in images with ""deep learning"" almost becoming a household term at the present time. However, a clear limitation in most of the present work is the restriction to two dimensional datasets such as images and the like. When the focus shifts to large three dimensional datasets such as 3D medical imaging, fluid dynamics simulations, remote sensing and electron microscopy, the problems become more difficult by several orders of magnitude. The automatic labeling of three dimensional structures in large datasets requires a comprehensive integration of machine learning and parallel computing with a ""from the ground up redesign"" to be efficient, accurate and capable of scaling to ever larger volumes. The benefits to the engineering communities and society at large are clear. Successful execution of this project will enable experts in a variety of disciplines in which three dimensional data are generated to efficiently perform large scale automated labeling of structures of interest like the hippocampus in brain images or vortices in fluid dynamics simulations. Students trained in this nexus of machine learning and parallel computing will be capable of making their own contributions ranging from academic research to commercialization. Finally, the software suites generated by this project should play a role in the formation of vertically integrated enterprises.<br/><br/>Volumetric applications require the development of novel, efficient and scalable machine learning algorithms as existing approaches are computationally intensive and are limited to small size images/video. Volumetric data require that approaches classify homogeneous regions into single categories while maintaining clear-cut region boundaries between classes (urban versus forest for example in terrain classification). To this end, new methods are developed for extracting supervoxels from volumetric datasets, using three dimensional filters, nonlinear dimensionality reduction and Hamilton-Jacobi or Schrodinger geodesic solvers. Next, deep learning principles which have resulted in automated feature extraction and discriminative convolutional filters must be adapted to work on volumetric data. Consequently, the integration of supervoxels and deep learning is central to the proposed work. Very limited expert interaction is permitted since the volume of the datasets is too large, therefore calling for semi-supervised learning approaches. The integrated machine learning and parallel processing software suite created by this project will be disseminated using software management repositories and open source licensing. In summary, the intellectual merit lies in the careful integration of semi-supervised learning, volumetric supervoxel driven segmentation, deep learning and parallel processing."

The need for increasingly simple and rapid methods to synthesize and quickly evaluate new molecules for the pharmaceutical industry has arisen due to the advent of new and modern experimental methods.  The drug development process requires thousands of chemical reactions to be conducted each and every day. Unfortunately, standard analytical methods needed to verify the structure and the purity of the molecules synthesized are often slow and unable to operate at such a pace. In this project, new and rapid optical techniques reported previously by the Anslyn group are being employed in real-life screening protocols typical of the workflow carried out at Merck, a global pharmaceutical company. This University of Texas-Merck collaboration tests the utility and generality of the methods, while also highlighting their power to benefit industrially-relevant, synthetic organic chemistry efforts in applications beyond pharmaceuticals. The Merck team provides their reactions to the Anslyn group, while the Anslyn group provides their analytical methods to Merck. Dr. Anslyn involves teams of students in a Freshman Research Initiative and Advanced Research Initiative laboratory in parallel projects, with the same goals and deliverables as his graduate research.  These activities involve specialized laboratory courses that teach freshman college students the challenges and rewards of scientific discovery, while improving the retention rates of these students in STEM curricula.<br/><br/>With funding from the NSF Chemistry Division, Dr. Anslyn of the University of Texas at Austin working with Merck to design and develop rapid chemical assays for enantiomeric excess (ee) that involve three stages referred to as screening, training, and analysis. The screening exploits the previously reported Anslyn multi-component assemblies that report ee values via circular dichroism (CD). The training is performed with enantioenriched samples of the chiral analyte, and involves standard linear calibration curves or chemometric analysis, as necessary. This step creates a protocol specific to a particular analyte, relating the resultant CD ellipticities to ee. Finally, the analysis step determines ee values in a truly high-throughput fashion, commensurate with a rate of hundreds of samples every hour. Each of these protocols is being created for the types of analytes that are of interest to the pharmaceutical community. In addition to the pharmaceutically-relevant compounds, significant effort is directed toward addressing samples in the complex matrices that industry uses. Graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin become familiar with the instrumentation required for and the processes undertaken to support high-throughput experimentation (HTE) within the pharmaceutical industry. Via quarterly visits to Merck, these students gain an understanding for the practical challenges associated with this approach through interaction with industrial scientists. Throughout the process, the scientists from Merck identify new substrates and reaction classes that have the greatest potential to positively impact asymmetric synthesis."

These systems display many interesting behaviors, such as the quantum Hall effect, that do not occur in three dimensional materials.  These unusual properties also make them of great interest for new devices and understanding these systems is also critical for progress in nanotechnology. Electrons on the surface of liquid helium was the first two-dimensional electron system discovered experimentally. It stands out as the most pristine two-dimensional system, as this system has no defects. Therefore studying it paves the way for understanding major physical phenomena in two dimensions without being hindered by imperfections. Because of the lack of disorder, the system is also of significant promise in terms of developing hardware for quantum information science. An important advantageous feature of the system is the possibility to control its parameters in a broad range, which enables characterizing various aspects of the system in a coherent fashion. As such, studying electrons on an helium surface provides a perfect ground for educating students interested in fundamental science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The proposed work is a joint experimental and theoretical effort with a dual aim.

To this end, the proposed work will address the interplay of electron correlations and the coupling to a bosonic field in the response to resonant radiation; the change of the structure and the conductivity of the electron liquid and solid phases by spatially periodic electrostatic lattices; and the novel effects which emerge in  a spatially periodic magnetic field and should provide an insight into new aspects of spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional systems."

The program consists of invited talks, a contributed poster session, and a student poster competition. The goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity for quantitative scientists and practitioners in the biological sciences to generate and share ideas for new creative research in statistics and genomics or genetics; to exchange knowledge on frontier statistical methodologies for problems rising from genomics and genetics; to stimulate professional networking opportunities; and to provide young researchers with exposure for their work.<br/><br/>The last decade has witnessed the rapid advancement of high-throughput technologies and the generation and storage of massive data sets. A huge number of new challenges in analyzing, modeling, and interpreting these massive data have arisen, forcing transformative change on research in biological and medical sciences in general, and genomics and genetics in particular. To meet those challenges and provide reliable approaches, statistical genomics and genetics have emerged from traditional statistics and have become indispensable tools for modern research in the biological and medical sciences, also paving the road to many important biological and medical discoveries in the last few years. On the other hand, novel problems arising in genomics and genetics have also motivated many new statistical concepts, models, and methodologies. Statistical genomics and genetics have been growing remarkably fast and apply to an increasing number of topics in both fields. They are now essential parts of modern biological and medical research and also generate important research topics within statistics.

One important step of this effect is the fast  elimination of the surface stress. This surface stress removal can cause weakening of strengthened glasses. At the same time, the phenomenon can be used to make glass mechanically stronger. The present research can clarify how a trace amount of water can cause these seemingly contradictory phenomena. Research results are discussed in the formal Glass Science course during the academic year, as well as in a ""pop-up' short course that includes a broader audience beyond science and engineering during summer sessions. Students - both women and men, and both undergraduates and graduates -trained in this research become valued employees for US high technology companies. <br/> <br/>Technical Details: In comparison to bulk glass, oxide glass surfaces (of the same composition) exhibit faster stress relaxation realized by moisture in air. This phenomenon is used to make mechanically stronger glass fibers by building the surface compressive stress caused by the fast surface stress relaxation. The phenomena can also explain long-standing mysteries related to mechanical strength of glasses such as the strength degradation of ion-exchange strengthened glasses, and static fatigue limit. The phenomenon of the fast surface stress relaxation is expected to be important in all amorphous oxides with large surface areas such as thin films, nano-particles and curved surfaces, which readily interact with a trace amount of water vapor. One main objective of the present research is to clarify the scientific origin of the fast surface stress relaxation. The second objective is to optimize the fiber strengthening process and clarify various anomalous features such as anomalous oxidation kinetics of Si with small radius of curvature. During this proposed research, two graduate students and four undergraduate students per year are trained in the glass science field."

However, one of the difficulties in creating a general age panacea is the fact that each cell within an organism ages differently. Therefore, one of the goals for aging research is to characterize how individual cells change over time.  This project will focus on muscle cells because muscle weakness is a common complaint in the elderly.  Single cell studies are usually difficult due to the small amount of source material. Advances in sequencing and cell collection technology provide an opportunity for research into single cell genomes. This research project utilizes facilities at RIKEN Yokohama to access the latest in single cell technologies and to benefit from the leadership of Dr. Aki Minoda.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop a single nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) protocol for the characterization of epigenetic heterogeneity in mouse skeletal muscle. While single cell ATAC-seq is available, viable snATAC-seq remains undeveloped. ATAC-seq is a novel method to determine the status of epigenetic chromatin modifications. Unlike other forms of sequencing, ATAC-seq is able to map nucleosome positions, thereby providing a multidimensional description of the cellular epigenome. Application of this promising technology to the question of ageing and ageing-related disease opens up new avenues of discourse and possible therapeutics. Development of single nucleus ATAC-seq ablates the size restriction inherent in ATAC-seq and will open up research in a variety of cell types in numerous other disease states. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

This study will investigate the how past volcanic eruptions have influenced polar stratospheric clouds and stratospheric ozone.  The project will also compare the effect of smaller, sustained volcanic emissions to the effect of large eruptions.  A computer model of atmospheric chemistry, dynamics, and radiation will be used to examine the impact of past eruptions and how they may slow down the recovery of the ozone hole. This study will also improve the models by including more realistic polar stratospheric clouds, which will improve our ability to model atmospheric chemistry, and ultimately, climate.<br/><br/>This study will investigate the evolution of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) influenced by volcanic eruptions and the resulting effect on ozone and related chemicals. Volcanic aerosols are observed to change stratospheric radiative flux and chemistry. Ozonesonde and satellite observations show enhanced ozone loss in the mid-latitudes and over Antarctica following the Mr. Pinaubo, Cerro Hudson, and El Chichon erruptions. An unanswered question is how small erruptions which occur every year but only inject a small fraction of the sulfur as a large eruption impact the ozone loss in polar regions and slow down the recovery of the ozone hole. This study will use the NSF/NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) with detailed ozone chemistry and the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) with an interactive sulfate and PSCs model. The model experiments will inject SO2 into the atmosphere in different amounts, times, and locations to simulate the volcanic eruptions observed during the past few decades. The results will be compared to satellite and in-situ observations from microphysical scales to global scales. Another goal of the project is to improve the NSF/NCAR WACCM model by treating PSCs more realistically. The project is relevant to understanding how the deposition of sulfates and dust in ice cores relates to the locations and strength of eruptions, to understanding year-to-year variations in Antarctic ozone loss driven by small eruptions, and to understanding the effect of PSCs and volcanic aerosols on the Antarctic energy balance.<br/>"

Unfortunately, eye trackers have limited features and functionality, which need to be augmented to effectively study the behavior of software developers performing programming and contextual tasks. Eye tracking devices only allow scientists to study fixed, limited-size, stimuli (e.g., block of text or image). Studies normally require that the text fit on one screen (or page). There is very limited or no support to allow such things as scrolling through longer documents or switching back and forth between documents on a computer. While this is sufficient to study how people read one line of code or a sentence it is wholly inadequate to study how programmers attempt to comprehend or develop a large software system.<br/><br/>The objective of the research is to address this limitation and drastically expand the types and size of stimuli that can be studied using an eye tracking device. In addition to supporting source code artifacts, it also supports artifacts such as stack overflow documents, bug reports, testing documents, and requirements.This enables software engineering researchers to conduct large-scale realistic eye-tracking studies seamlessly within a software development environment.  This eye-tracking-enabled infrastructure for studying program comprehension has the potential to transform the way lab studies and field studies are designed and executed as it advances the state of the art in conducting eye tracking studies in software engineering.  The infrastructure directly impacts society by paving the way to further improve IDEs to support the developer in various software engineering tasks through the various research projects it facilitates. The immediate impact is to facilitate controlled laboratory and field environments for a community of researchers. The research may lead to software development tools that incorporate eye-tracking as part of a more productive programming environment leading to higher quality software."

It is charged with the oversight and guidance of specialized laboratories at several national synchrotron facilities.  COMPRES laboratory scientists determine the basic material properties of the inaccessible Earth and these measurements, in turn, shed light on questions of direct societal impact, such as the causes of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. They can also help explain the formation of natural resources within the Earth, and they can improve our quality of life through the discovery of new advanced materials.  As part of its mission, COMPRES continually develops new infrastructure and technologies to advance U.S. geoscience research.<br/><br/>Data from mineral physics measurements carried out at COMPRES-supported facilities are critical for interpreting seismological and volcanological phenomena as well as other geophysical processes operating in the Earths interior.  Synchrotron-based techniques have played an ever-increasing role in experimental efforts to measure properties of geological materials at high pressures and temperatures. COMPRES is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the new generation of synchrotrons that offer great promise for the coming decade and beyond. For example, our beam line facilities XPD and FIS will be stationed at Brookhaven National Laboratory?s National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II), which is a recently completed, $900 million facility, that produces X-rays over 10,000 times brighter than its predecessor NSLS, while providing improved spatial and energy resolution as well as a world-leading synchrotron-infrared (IR) radiation source. COMPRES also supports diamond anvil cell (DAC) beam lines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) Argonne National Laboratory, at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a multi-anvil press project at Arizona State University. The new or upgraded synchrotrons augmented by improvements in x-ray optics and detectors will lead to dramatic advances in measurements at high pressure. Thus, the upcoming period, spanned by the new 5-year cooperative agreement, offers exciting opportunities as these synchrotron facilities will dramatically improve experimental capabilities and allow for novel experiments needed to test hypotheses and address yet-unanswered questions on the nature of deep planetary interiors. Infrastructure and facility developments supported by COMPRES are at the same time creating a new generation of tools and techniques for attaining and measuring the deep interior environment in the laboratory."

In particular, input shaping, which is a specific approach in command shaping, can be used to reduce vibration in flexible systems simply by altering the input command. Although input shaping has become increasingly prominent, quality educational programs for this control method are not readily available. This project will allow collaboration between Dr. Seong-Wook Hong, a recognized expert on input shaping, and the PI in the creation of new educational materials to expand the knowledge on this topic. Furthermore, the PI will leverage Dr. Hong's experimental equipment at the Kumoh National Institute of Technology in Korea to verify an input shaping method that will improve the controllability of ship-mounted boom cranes. This project will expand the knowledgebase of input shaping in complex dynamic systems while facilitating the education of future engineers on this topic.<br/><br/>Input shaping is a command shaping method by which a desired input command is convolved with a series of impulses to produce a shaped command that imparts little to no residual vibration. It is particularly useful in the control of cranes, which can exhibit multiple degrees of freedom. Because these systems tend to have an operator-in-the-loop, input shaping can offer better performance than a closed-loop feedback methods; its intuitive nature is more compatible with a human operator. The main drawback of this open-loop method is its inability to compensate for nonzero initial conditions. As part of this project, a new input shaping technique that eliminates such initial conditions will be experimentally tested. This research will facilitate the control of ship-mounted boom cranes, which are frequently used for such tasks as ASV retrieval and cargo transfer.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

Often referred to as ""dead zones"" because of their lack of larger organisms, OMZs actually support specific microbial communities adapted to survive in these low-oxygen regions. These microbes perform metabolic processes that produce greenhouse gases such as methane, and significantly alter global nitrogen budgets. In turn, viruses can alter every aspect of microbial communities by causing mortality and altering microbial functions; yet we know little regarding how viruses affect OMZ ecosystems, which is limiting our ability to predict future changes to the Earth system as these OMZs expand over time. This proposed research seeks to fill this knowledge gap by examining the types of viruses that are present in OMZs, as well as how they alter microbial communities and their impact on global processes. In the broader perspective, this proposed work will provide extensive datasets for 7 marine OMZ regions that can be interrogated through publically-available analysis tools, thus enabling environmental science for both research and educational purposes including real-world research experience in undergraduate classes to strengthen scientific education. One postdoc, two graduate students, and undergraduate students will be trained and mentored during this project. Furthermore, the work will facilitate international collaboration with leading microbial oceanographers from across the world.<br/><br/>This project will use recent advances in quantitative environmental viral analysis to rapidly enhance our knowledge of OMZ viral communities through examination of 100s of samples from 7 globally-distributed marine OMZ regions with varying levels of oxygen depletion. The specific aims of the project are to (i) gain a basic understanding of viral abundances, viral-induced microbial mortality, and viral community structure, as well as the environmental conditions that drive differences in these parameters, and (ii) assess the effects of viruses on nutrient and gas cycling in OMZs. These aims will be accomplished through analyzing viral metagenomes to assess how viral communities differ among the 7 diverse OMZ regions, and how they diverge from communities in oxygenated waters. Further, the viral metagenomes will be coupled with microbial metagenomes to assess virus-host dynamics and the effects of viral-induced mortality on microorganisms performing key metabolic functions. Finally, the abundance and expression of viral-encoded metabolic genes will be used to perform gene-based biogeochemical modeling to determine the extent of viral influences in OMZ biogeochemical cycling."

The potential role of an endosymbiont, Rickettsia, in shaping the tick virome composition will be investigated by comparing Rickettsia-positive and Rickettsia-negative viromes. A targeted approach will explore tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPV), a genus of emerging human pathogens in Asia and the United States. Determining the prevalence and diversity of phleboviruses will provide insight into the evolution of this group of viruses. Through these approaches I expect to identify a diversity of viruses due to the expansive and diverse host range of ticks over their long life cycle, and hypothesize there is a core virome associated with the tick endosymbiont Rickettsia, that is not observed in Rickettsia-negative ticks.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

The project has a goal of bringing together key stakeholders from across the state to develop a future Noyce Master Teaching Fellowships project in New Hampshire (NH).  This project comes at a critical time for New Hampshire because of science education's shift toward Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), the development of new statewide performance assessments, and a changing student demographic. In order to have a competitive STEM workforce in the future, teachers will need strong STEM pedagogy and a curriculum that improves the educational opportunities and achievements for all students, including the underachieving student populations of the socioeconomically disadvantaged, English language learners, and racial/ethnic minorities. The project team will bring together key stakeholders in NH to develop a proposal for high-need school districts to provide opportunities for teachers to become Master Teachers in their districts. <br/><br/>The primary partners of this Noyce Capacity Building project will include the NH State Department of Education; two key school districts: Rochester and Nashua, NH; two professional societies: the NH Science Teachers Association and the NH State Math Teachers Association; and the University of New Hampshire, including STEM education researchers and teacher professional development expertise from the university. Given the size and autonomy of NH, implementing a statewide program for Master Teachers will require a significant partnership building and needs assessment. During the capacity building period, the project will bring together these key stakeholders to conduct a needs assessment and develop a statewide program proposal. The Making Noyce in New Hampshire project will have the following primary goals: 1) establishing strong within-district STEM pedagogy expertise, 2) developing and sustaining enhanced science and mathematics learning for students, and 3) developing and delivering STEM instruction and curricula that improve the educational opportunities and achievements of underachieving student populations. The project's long term goal includes advancing the capacity of STEM teachers to become teacher leaders in high-need school districts. This project recognizes that identifying and placing Master Teachers will not be successful without the creation of a network that understands the needs of individual districts and teacher candidates. As such, this capacity building project will allow us to work towards a successful model for Master Teachers in NH, one that will work in school districts across the state and could be used as a model for other states that are challenged with changing standards and student demographics."

One such challenge is the ability to reproduce a small scale design for minimal costs. As interesting as the small scale can be, the most limiting factor is cost. Equipment usage can be great expenditure for universities and individuals, but the investigations they lead to can one day change the world. Such investigations in the microscale is using biocompatible microrobots that can be used for drug delivery or minimally invasive surgery. Having the right microstructure of the microrobotic system can help determine when and how microrobots perform specific tasks within the body. With the assistance of Dr. Chi Won Ahn, Director at the National Nano Fabrication Center (NNFC), located at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea; the production of a biofactory-on-a-chip capable of the repeatable fabrication of complex microstructures can be completed. <br/><br/>Biocompatibility is a component of large concern when it comes to the topic of microrobots for the specific use of in vivo applications, as such polysaccharide-base hydrogels are an interesting point of research.  To create polysaccharide-base hydrogels, the process of cross-linking sodium alginate and calcium chloride is completed through a droplet producing method, which can also encapsulate organic and nonorganic materials. It is because of this ability that these hydrogels are referred to as artificial cells. Artificial cells encapsulated by paramagnetic nanoparticles can be manipulated to move under global inputs of a uniform magnetic field. Using an algorithmic method call, object particle computation, these artificial cells are moved under the globally input magnetic field until they reach an obstacle. From the obstacle, the artificial cells then move in a clockwise direction and the pattern is repeated. The process continues until the artificial cells reach their final destination and exits the algorithm. To produce the algorithm, a PDMS mold, produced from photolithography and softlithography techniques are used. Controlling the flow is a pneumatic valve system which would control the fluid flow as well as the input of new alginate cells into the algorithm. Altogether, the system is called a biofactory-on-a-chip, which can continually produce microstructures designed in the object particle computation. With the assistance of Dr. Ahn?s team at the NNFC, the equipment and expertise necessary to complete the manufacturing process is readily available. Such a biofactory-on-a-chip will enable the repeatable cost-effective fabrication method of complex microstructures. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea."

New devices can be created from intermediate scale features where transitional properties between molecular and bulk behaviors can be accessed and controlled. To realize nanomanufacturing of such hybrid materials, low-cost, flexible, simple, and scalable methods need to be developed to efficiently organize inorganic and organic species into a large number of features with distinct functions. Self-assembly is prone to defect formation and probe- and e-beam-based lithography techniques are often too slow for mass production. This award investigates a broadly applicable nanoimprint lithography process for patterning nanoparticle-polymer hybrid composite materials and to use them to manufacture nano-scale optical and electronic devices. This is accomplished by using nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents that can fill nanoimprinted polymer molds quickly and then be consolidated to form patterned features with high nanoparticle loadings. The project provides training to both graduate and undergraduate students. Several outreach activities on the Virginia Tech campus and summer camps at Science Museum of Western Virginia are planned to increase the enrollment of females and minorities in engineering.<br/><br/>Nanoimprint lithography can transfer nanoscale patterns with high fidelity and repeatability in large scales. However, most of the research has been focused on pure polymeric material systems. This project explores nanoimprint lithography for nanoparticle-polymer hybrid patterning by addressing the key scientific challenges of nanoparticle and polymer (monomer) co-dispersion in organic solvents and patterning the nanoparticle and polymer co-suspensions into nano-scale features using the evaporative nature of dispersing solvents and the polymer chain transition from dispersed and soluble state to solid state. The research work fully explores different methods of nanoparticle dispersion in organic solvents in the presence of polymeric chains. The understanding of nanoparticle-polymer co-dispersion and organic solvent evaporation during lithographic molding promises to push the boundaries of novel hybrid pattern formation. In contrast to traditional nanoimprint lithography, which uses polymer materials only, a new class of hybrid materials with intricate architectures and novel functionalities is expected. The hybrid patterns can offer a wide range of feature arrangements for direct device uses. This holds great scientific and application potentials by combining the knowledge at the boundaries of the particle-solvent-polymer and liquid-solid domains."

The macaques' social behaviors will be observed and recorded at their nightly sleeping sites using camera traps and at their daily feeding sites using standard behavioral observation procedures. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jin-Hua Li and Dr. Dongpo Xia of Anhui University who are experts on the Tibetan macaques at Mt. Huangshan.

Osteoarthritis, a chronic disease causing cartilage dysfunction, affects more than 27 million Americans and represents a significant societal burden. To restore cartilage function and alleviate joint pain in osteoarthritis patients, it is necessary to understand the structure and mechanical properties of healthy cartilage as a benchmark. Cartilage is mainly composed of collagen and proteoglycan (protein attached with negatively charged sugar chains). The direct contribution of collagen and the large proteoglycan, aggrecan, to cartilage biomechanics is well understood.  Small proteoglycans do not contribute directly to cartilage biomechanical properties; however, they may regulate the structural assembly of cartilage by interacting with both collagen and aggrecan. Combining novel nanotechnology and gene modification tools, this project aims to determine how the most abundant small proteoglycan in cartilage, decorin, modifies the structure and biomechanics of cartilage. The outcomes will have a broader impact by identifying a new molecular mechanism that governs cartilage structural integrity, which can enable the development of novel strategies for restoring cartilage function and attenuating cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis.  New outreach programs will be established to increase the participation of minority students in STEM education and career paths. Specific outreach activities include workshops for Philadelphia inner city high school teachers and students, as well as the development of science museum exhibition displays.<br/><br/>The cartilage of decorin knockout mice develops substantially reduced aggrecan content and impaired mechanical properties. This project will determine whether decorin governs the structural assembly of aggrecan. We hypothesize that decorin regulates the presence of aggrecan in cartilage through interacting with aggrecan in the extracellular matrix, and through influencing the synthesis of aggrecan by chondrocytes. This hypothesis will be tested at a hierarchy of length scales. First, at the molecular level, adhesion between decorin and aggrecan will be quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based molecular force spectroscopy. Second, at the cellular level, the synthesis and mechanics of aggrecan by normal and decorin knockout chondrocytes will be evaluated by biochemical assays and AFM single cell nanoindentation. Lastly, at the tissue level, the expression of decorin will be ablated at different phases of post-natal joint growth using our novel inducible decorin-knockout murine model. The resulting changes in cartilage biomechanics, including both elastic and poroviscoelastic properties, will be evaluated by our custom-built nanorheometer. In conclusion, this project will elucidate how the small proteoglycan, decorin, regulates the aggrecan assembly in cartilage, thereby ensuring cartilage structural integrity and proper biomechanical functions"

Addressing this problem requires skilled and well-informed collaboration between indigenous communities and academic experts, and the expertise necessary to achieve such collaboration requires specialized training in linguistics and a variety of other fields. The Institute for Collaborative Language Research (CoLang) is designed to respond to these needs.  CoLang is a unique summer institute that provides critical training for researchers and collaborators in language documentation techniques and practices. The Institute advances the scientific study of language, enables the preservation of rapidly disappearing knowledge, and trains the next generation of language researchers. The promotion of linguistic knowledge that CoLang represents is essential in our globalized world and as the United States increasingly becomes linguistically diverse. In effect, activities of Institute alumni and participants foster strong international relationships and capacity building, serving a role akin to soft diplomacy and in support of the national interest.CoLang 2018 will be held at The University of Florida in June and July 2018.  Broader impacts include training of academic linguists, undergraduate and graduate students, and indigenous community members, including those underrepresented in the language sciences.  Additionally, workshop materials will be disseminated to attendees as well as a wider public audience through a new endangered language archive, The University of Florida Language Archive (TUFLA).<br/><br/>CoLang 2018 will consist of two parts, lasting five weeks total. First, two weeks of intensive workshops focus on the practice and principles of documentary linguistics and fieldwork, ranging from new technology to interdisciplinary methods to best practices in ethical community collaborations. Second, the Institute offers an optional three weeks of intensive field methods courses focused on working with speakers of different endangered languages. These practica weeks require participants to use the technology and documentation skills acquired during the preceding workshops. The entire five-week Institute thus offers state of the art instruction, combined with guided practical experience, allowing participants to acquire methods, technical skills and collaborative approaches.  CoLang has a developed a significant track record of national and international success.  Previous participants have used their CoLang training to venture into successful fieldwork and community documentation projects across the world. Importantly, one of the themes for CoLang 2018 is archiving, key to the development and adoption of interoperable standards and data sharing.  CoLang 2018 activities in this area will continue to support models of robust and reliable research in the social and behavioral sciences, including through the data management of practicum documentation and its onsite archiving at TUFLA by CoLang participants."

However, achieving this goal is by no means easy. Existing datacenter job scheduling and resource provisioning mechanisms are bottom-up, point solutions, addressing partial aspects of the related design challenges only, and hence, fail to achieve the above goal.<br/><br/>The proposed research will develop a top-down, holistic approach concerning the entire datacenter systems stack, aiming at achieving the dual goal. It starts from the very top, i.e., the QoE or user utility requirements at the user application level. It then works its way downward, by mapping user-level requirements into datacenter system-level resource demands, which, together with the datacenter computing and networking resource constraints, set the boundary conditions for a proposed user-utility-aware optimization framework. Finally, an example software-based design and implementation of the proposed solution will be developed for a state-of-the-art, distributed datacenter. Successfully achieving this goal will provide significant improvement in performance guarantees and resource utilization in current and future datacenters for a wide range of applications with diverse QoE requirements. Moreover, the proposed approach promotes fundamental analysis in guiding the design of robust complex systems and may give rise to new theories for datacenter and cloud computing in general. The involvement of underrepresented minority and women students, and students with disability in this proposed research through existing course offerings and a REU program will enhance their competitiveness in the future job market."

Geometry is perhaps the oldest part of mathematics, and number theory, the study of equations and their solutions in whole numbers, is hardly younger.  Yet it is only in the very recent history of mathematics that researchers have understood just how interrelated these subjects are and how much they have to offer each other.  One example is the ""cap set problem,"" related to the popular card game Set.  In the game, one asks:  how many cards is it possible to have on the table with no legal play?  It turns out that this problem has to do with the geometry of points and lines in 4-dimensional space, with equations among numbers and their last base-3 digit, and the relation between these.  In 2016 the PI was part of a major breakthrough on this old problem, and his proposed research will continue investigating the new ideas that led to progress as well as other projects mixing number theory and geometry.<br/> <br/>The proposal covers several areas in number theory, algebraic geometry, topology, combinatorics, and applied math, in collaboration with a wide group of fellow researchers, including graduate students.  One of the central questions of arithmetic statistics is: how many number fields are there of discriminant at most X? More particularly: how many of these have Galois group G for a specified subgroup G of a symmetric group S_n? A famous conjecture of Malle proposes a description for the asymptotic behavior of this count as X grows.   Many of the major themes in contemporary number theory (e.g. Bhargava's work on counting quartic and quintic extensions, progress on Cohen-Lenstra conjectures) concern cases of this conjecture. In previous work, the PI showed that the Cohen-Lenstra conjecture over the function field F_q(t) could be approached by the methods of algebraic topology, using Grothendieck's theory of etale cohomology as the bridge between the two subjects. Now the PI proposes to prove the upper bound in the Malle conjecture in the case K = F_q(t), again using a combination of topological and arithmetic methods, but now with input from the theory of quantum shuffle algebras.   In another project, the PI proposes to investigate the analogy between Malle's conjectures and the Batyrev-Manin conjectures, which study the asymptotics for rational points with bounded height on algebraic varieties. The height is a natural notion of complexity of an algebraic point just as the discriminant is for a number field.  Here, the technical bridge is the theory of algebraic stacks; the PI will develop a theory of rational points of bounded height on Deligne-Mumford stacks, which first of all requires defining the height of a point on a stack. In particular, the discriminant of a number field is the height (in the novel sense) of a point on the classifying stack of a finite group. The PI will formulate a generalized Batyrev-Manin conjecture for stacks, which specializes to both Malle's conjecture and the Batyrev-Manin conjecture. The PI will also investigate properties of the new definition: for instance, the PI will aim to prove that the Faltings height is actually height on the moduli stack of abelian varieties in this sense.  The PI also proposes problems in additive combinatorics, the homology of FI-modules, and the geometry of machine learning."

The project team will iteratively refine existing, computer-based pedagogical materials based on an analysis of log data of hundreds of students who have used those materials to learn. The work will be done with middle school mathematics students, specifically sixth grade students, and the target topic will be decimals. Recent research and studies have indicated that learning from the errors of others -- a prominent pedagogical approach used in medical education, but less commonly used in other areas of education -- has considerable potential to help students learn. Yet, erroneous examples are not used widely, in part because it is not yet understood how and why they provide this benefit. The broader impact of the project is that it will provide improved mathematics lessons, infused with erroneous examples, vetted with empirical evidence of their effectiveness, which can be deployed on the world-wide web to the significant number of U.S. students who are at risk of poor mathematics achievement due to poor understanding of core STEM concepts. The project will also provide a blueprint that can be used widely in other projects and systems, supported by both theory and empirical evidence, for how to help students learn from erroneous examples. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>The project will employ an iterative research plan in which log data from online learning of erroneous examples will be datamined and analyzed. The project team will start with log data from over 600 middle school mathematics students who have used erroneous examples to learn in online instructional technology and games. The team will then collect data from approximately two thousand more students over the course of the three-year project to explore whether enhancements to the erroneous examples materials based on revised theory improves student learning. Moment-by-moment learning models will be used to understand whether students learn immediately from erroneous examples, or whether erroneous examples lead to future learning. The project team will also study whether confusion and other forms of affect mediate successful learning from erroneous examples, using previously validated automated detectors of confusion and other affective states. The project team will also investigate how each of the steps of the student interaction with the erroneous examples -- for example, identifying errors, fixing errors, and explaining errors -- promote learning and positive affect. By the end of the third year of the project, the project team anticipates having a comprehensive theoretical model of how learning with erroneous examples works and how erroneous examples should be integrated into instruction more generally."

This project is organized in four research thrusts: (1) designing an architecture and data processing pipeline for a wearable system composed of heterogeneous embedded modules; (2) devising an ultra-low-power, analog, signal-processing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for energy-efficient, on-board feature extraction; (3) modeling and optimizing machine-learning classifiers for acoustic event detection and localization; and (4) designing an interface and feedback mechanisms that are optimized for the users' perceptual, cognitive, and motor control abilities.<br/><br/>This research will help reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and expand knowledge on designing wearable systems for enhancing safety in cities, workplaces, and the home. The underlying framework can be generalized to other systems - employing low-power signal processors and algorithms to solve real-time sensing and classification problems of many kinds. Research products will be made publicly available to anyone to apply these techniques in their own system designs. Course modules developed on embedded systems, mobile computing, and Internet-of-Things will be used at the three participating universities to train undergraduate and graduate students, and will be made available online."

The project aims to further develop the mathematical analysis underlying phenomena governed by surface tension as well as other important systems.<br/><br/>The variational problems under study concern constant mean curvature surfaces, prescribed curvature equations, curvature flows, and isoperimetric comparison theorems. A main goal of the project is obtaining a sharp quantitative description of surfaces with almost constant mean curvature, which would lead to new results of importance in capillarity theory. Other goals of the project are developing a capillarity theory based on nonlocal surface energies, and addressing in quantitative form various rigidity theorems involving intrinsic or extrinsic curvatures of hypersurfaces. In the latter direction the program will address the quantitative analysis of prescribed scalar curvature equations, of the Pogorelov theorem on surfaces with vanishing Gauss curvature, and of the Levy-Gromov isoperimetric comparison theorem. Considerable effort will be devoted to the training of students through involvement in research on the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory, and mass transportation theory."

The goal of this research is to obtain new iron-based agents that produce effective MRI contrast at the field strengths found in the newest MRI scanners.  Iron is a biologically relevant metal ion that may be an alternative to the currently used gadolinium, which has tolerance issues in imaging.  The project lies at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry, as well as physiology and imaging physics and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Morrow has a strong record of educating a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students and their science teacher are also be part of the funded project.  <br/><br/>Macrocyclic Fe(III) complexes are being developed as MRI contrast agents with the goal of obtaining agents that produce effective T1 contrast at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 3 Tesla (T). The complexes contain highly stabilized Fe(III) centers that do not produce reactive oxygen species.  Complexes that contain one bound water or no water ligands are to be studied to assess the effect of outer versus innersphere water on T1 relaxivity.  A second emphasis is to develop Fe(III) contrast agents that change paramagnetic properties with temperature and pH.  These spin state changes interconvert Fe(III) paramagnetic CEST (Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) agents and T1 contrast agents. EPR (Electron paramagnetic resonance) and Mossbauer spectroscopy will be used for characterization of the complexes. To study the magnetic field strength dependence of relaxivity, the complexes will be studied on MRI scanners at 1.5 T, 3.0 T and 4.7 T.  A nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion spectrum will be obtained for selected Fe(III) complexes.  The most effective Fe(III) contrast agents will be studied and compared to Gd(III) contrast agents in biological samples."

Both are scientists at the University of Tokyo, Department of Astronomy. Professor Narita and this project's principal investigator (PI) are members of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Science Team. TESS is a NASA mission that will launch in March 2018 to search most of the sky for relatively nearby transiting exoplanets. With near-term technology, mankind's best chance of finding exoplanets that could host life lies in examining the atmospheres of super-Earth planets transiting relatively cool, low-mass M-dwarf host stars within their habitable zones (Charbonneau & Deming, 2007). Simulations predict that TESS will detect about 1,700 exoplanets over its two-year primary mission, and that one-third of those planets will have radii less than twice that of Earth, with three-quarters of these super-Earths orbiting M-dwarfs (Sullivan et al., 2015). However, simulations also show that TESS will detect over 1,000 astrophysical false positives. Thus, TESS discoveries must be validated as originating from real exoplanets using additional instruments and/or techniques. The Japanese have proposed that their recently-developed Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for Studying Atmospheres of Transiting Exoplanets (MuSCAT) at Okayama Observatory be used as a tool to distinguish TESS-discovered exoplanets from false positives. <br/><br/>The purpose of this research project is to simulate follow-up observations of TESS detections using MuSCAT, thereby revealing which planet candidates can be efficiently validated using MUSCAT, and which must be validated using other techniques. This understanding will allow astronomers to better prioritize and optimize follow-up validations of TESS detections, which in turn will lead to optimal use of valuable space assets, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Transiting exoplanets can be distinguished from astrophysical false positives by determining the wavelength/color-dependence of the amount of stellar light received transiting exoplanets are largely achromatic when observed in different bandpasses. Thus, TESS discoveries can be validated as true transiting exoplanets by determining the wavelength/color-dependence of the amount of stellar light detected on Earth. The PI will simulate MuSCAT observations of TESS detections by developing a software code that models the performance of the MuSCAT instrument (Narita et al., 2015) and accounts for all significant noise sources, such as photon noise, sky background noise, and scintillation noise. TESS planet candidates will vary tremendously in terms of parameters such as the temperature and brightness of the host star, or size and orbital distance of the planet. To provide a realistic estimate of likely candidate planets, the PI will use the database of simulated TESS-detected exoplanets published by Sullivan et al. (2015), as well as simulated false positives detected by TESS (available to the TESS Science team).  <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)."

How living things can arise from the ""behavior"" of molecules, which are simply obeying the laws of physics, is the essential conundrum of modern biology. The rise of scientific supercomputing has offered the chance to study living systems at the level of atoms, cells, and all levels in between.  Now, in the era of petascale computing, with computational resources like Blue Waters, it is becoming possible to take the most critical step from inanimate to animate matter by describing assembly and cooperation of thousands of macromolecules made of billions of atoms.<br/><br/>The projects in this proposal will use Blue Waters to study the chemo-mechanical properties of motor proteins, and the structure and function of the macromolecular complexes central to bacterial chemotaxis and plant fiber metabolism. Notably, all the projects build on extensive previous work. The first project will study the mechanisms of two motor systems: protein unfolding by ClpX unfoldase and cytoskeletal cargo transport by cytoplasmic dynein. The chemosensory array project seeks to answer how input from many chemical sensors on the bacterial surface are transduced across hundreds of nanometers in the array, leading the cell to decide if it should continue swimming or change direction, to adapt to changing environments. The cellulosome project aims to answer why human gut bacteria produces such an elaborate cellulosome when compared to the cellulosomes produced by other bacteria.  All the projects will leverage computational methods to combine structural data from multiple sources of differing resolutions (X-ray crystallography of individual proteins, medium-resolution cryo-EM of multi-protein systems, and low-resolution cryo-EM tomography of subcellular organelles) yielding atomic-resolution structural models of structures on the order of 100 nm in size, containing 10-100 million atoms. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project is the ongoing development of the hugely popular (over 300,000 registered users) NAMD and VMD software, which, combined with the longstanding training efforts of the PIs, will enable researchers worldwide to address key health and energy needs of mankind."

Professor Philippe Buhlmann of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities is developing redox buffer polymers and redox buffer nanoporous carbons to demonstrate their application for sensors. This approach extends the sensor lifetime and requires no calibration. Chemical sensors are used to measure the concentration of chemical species in water, food, industrial liquids, and biological samples in a similar way as a thermometer is used to measure temperature. In particular, electrochemical sensors with high selectivities are used for billions of measurements of ion concentrations annually. Unfortunately, conventional ion sensors must be recalibrated frequently, which requires a constant supply of reagents and either automation or trained personnel. This complicates point-of-care applications and raises cost. This work eliminates the need for recalibration. Broader impacts are also evidenced through the inclusion of high school students in the research activities  and outreach activities that introduce sensors in hands-on-activies in community libraries. <br/><br/>Polymers and nanoporous carbon materials with a redox buffer capacity at a well-defined electrochemical potential offer a unique way to prepare calibration-free sensors. The materials developed in this project exhibit features distinguishing them from previously reported polymers and carbons with redox-active groups: they exhibit batch-independent electrochemical potentials with a high reproducibility and good long-term chemical stabilities. These properties result from two design principles: (i) the redox buffer polymers and nanoporous carbons incorporate both the oxidized and reduced form of a distinct redox couple in equal quantitities, defining the potential as given by the Nernst equation. (ii) the redox-active groups are specifically selected to be stable under ambient conditions both in the oxidized and reduced form. The response mechanism of potentiometric sensors using these new materials is thoroughly investigated, which includes the quantification of electron and ion conductivities in the redox buffer polymers as well as the interfacial electron and ion transfer kinetics."

To that end, this project will employ a stereotype inoculation model to test whether environments characterized by majorities of marginalized group members serve to reduce the negative effects of stereotypes, protect identity development, and facilitate self-efficacy and career-related motivation.

The first model will portray an erosion process whereby scientific disidentification increases as a function of racial bias and stereotype threat. A second counteractive model will test the potentially facilitative effects of racial identity on scientific self-efficacy through its spillover effect on scientific identity. The third model will examine the unconditional latent growth of implicit scientific identity, as well as the time-varying effects of students? perceptions of their mentoring relationships on the identity outcomes. Data will be collected from cohorts comprising more than 500 STEM majors attending the two universities participating in the project. Outcomes from this work will advance stereotype inoculation theory development through its innovative contextual focus on the micro- and macro-level processes that influence African American science students?

The study will also (a) provide insights into the mediating role that multiple identities, both racial and scientific identity, play in buffering these stereotypes, and (b) identify the interpersonal ingredients that comprise effective faculty-student relationships that give shape to multiculturally inclusive academic climates"

These quasiparticles are responsible for optoelectronic behavior of materials used in many device applications including, photovoltaics, light emitting diodes and light detectors. These electron and hole quasiparticles, similar to particles in ambient, can go through phase transitions from noninteracting gas to condensed liquid phase at high enough densities and low temperatures. The condensed quasiparticle state exhibits very different electronic properties compared to dilute phase. However so far the studies involving the electron-hole condensation are limited to very low temperatures and high laser excitation densities in limited group of material systems. This project focuses on study of these condensed electron-hole states in atomically thin semiconductors at high temperatures. The educational component of the research involves recruiting high school students specifically from underrepresented communities to the labs. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Atomically thin 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) provide a remarkable excitonic system with a large exciton binding energy, more than an order of magnitude larger than typical semiconductor materials. These materials can provide unprecedented opportunities for the studies of quantum many-body physics at elevated temperatures. It has been known that excitons at high enough densities condense into electron-hole plasma and then into a liquid. But in general this gas to liquid phase transition takes place at cryo-temperatures. Here the proposed work aims to study the phase transition of excitons in 2D TMDC materials into a state of electron-hole liquid (EHL) at room temperature and above. This exciton condensation is a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical gas condensation into a liquid droplet. This work will pursue a thorough understanding of the exciton condensation in 2D TMDC materials."

Though we often do not notice, every time we say a word or sound, it comes out differently. Our best language technologies (e.g. Siri) often fail precisely because of this variability, which shows just how difficult it is to learn about the sounds of language from variable speech. Nonetheless, infants learn about the sounds of their language within the first year of their life, and they do this with much less data and fewer resources than language technologies have access to. This project tests hypotheses about how infants solve this learning problem so effectively, by using computational models to simulate the learning process. This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Reiko Mazuka at RIKEN Brain Science Institute, who has the only existing dataset with the necessary annotations for this project. Understanding how infants, the most successful language learners, learn can help improve language technologies so that they work more successfully across a wider range of languages and are more usable by a larger proportion of society, including people with accented speech and children, whose speech continues to pose problems for such systems. <br/><br/>Various unsupervised sound category learning models will be tested on their ability to learn the Japanese vowel contrast, which no previous models have successfully learned. One of the factors that contributes to the difficulty of this particular learning problem is prosody - or the rhythm and intonation of speech - which systematically lengthens vowels in particular positions and causes overlap between short and long vowels through a process known as phrase-final lengthening. Knowing how prosody affects the duration of vowels and factoring out its influence could be helpful in learning the Japanese sound categories. This project will incorporate prosody into two existing computational models of sound category learning and see whether this improves learning outcomes. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Ensuring that this critical workforce is broadly inclusive of individuals with relevant capabilities and skills requires a highly adaptive, networked system of interdisciplinary educational collaboration, and innovative employment preparation strategies, programs, and approaches. This approach constitutes a partnership of scientists and engineers, educators, trainers, innovation networks, laboratories, research institutions, and employers. This science policy research report addresses these issues, detailing barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations, focusing on people with disabilities and high technology industry and non-government employers. Distinct applications of related research are studied, such as the inclusion of veterans who became disabled in the line of service, and with applicable education and training, could be new participants in the STEM workforce. This is especially important as both these populations might not be aware of, or not actively involved in social networks of STEM innovators, and conversely technology innovators might not fully consider these individuals. The report explores new frameworks, decision support tools, dissemination design parameters, and knowledge-generating communities to provide lessons learned and guidance for innovative best practices and inclusion in STEM disciplines. Addressing the under-representation of people with disabilities in STEM fields, it offers an analysis of relevant research and policy approaches and looks to inform related government agenda setting and decision making.<br/><br/>Much research on the STEM participation of people with disabilities has tended to emphasize specific disability characteristics. Building upon findings generated during the 2016 Symposium on the Science of Broadening Participation (SoBP), sponsored by the National Science Foundation, this project takes a wider, interdisciplinary perspective, looking a range of social, economic, methodological, institutional, and policy contexts. Identifying barriers and opportunities for increasing participation in STEM fields among under-served populations and policy approaches, the report addresses the need for novel approaches to developing and nurturing a qualified, diverse, and agile U.S. STEM workforce. The report articulates a framework for developing tools and approaches to understand the role of collaborative networks of innovation that encourage STEM participation of individuals with disabilities. The report explores research that can enhance broadened participation, and addresses areas in which targeted efforts would be valuable, including a toolkit for assessing innovative practices and organizational structures in the context of knowledge transfer and closing knowledge-practice gaps, and a sustainable design for a Professional Inclusive Innovation Network (PIIN) of innovation nodes and researchers to test inclusive practices.

The persistence of kelp forests depends on the balance between kelp production and consumption by herbivores. Overgrazing by herbivores such as sea urchins can lead to deforestation and loss of kelp forest associated organisms. Ecklonia radiata is the main canopy-forming kelp in northeastern New Zealand and supports fisheries species such as spiny lobster. Sea temperature is predicted to increase over the 21st century both globally and in New Zealand waters. Previous research has shown that rate of food consumption by many marine invertebrates increases at elevated temperature due to increased metabolism. However, the effects of increased temperature on consumption rate may be affected by sedimentation, which is also predicted to change in the future. Sediment load to New Zealand waters has increased due to human activities, and weather changes and coastal erosion are predicted to increase sediment load in the future. This project will investigate the effects of future predicted temperature and sediment load on the grazing and respiration rate of the New Zealand sea urchin (Evechinus chloroticus). Grazing and respiration rates will be measured under current ambient conditions and predicted future elevated temperature and sediment load, separately and in combination, in a lab experiment conducted in collaboration with Dr. Nick Shears at the University of Auckland?s Leigh Marine Laboratory. Understanding the effects of environmental changes on this important member of the kelp forest community will help determine the future stability of kelp forests in New Zealand. <br/><br/>Future changes in climate and coastal development could lead to high sediment conditions spreading into locations currently unaffected, with effects on trophic dynamics of those systems. The global stressor of increased sea temperature may interact with local stressors and alter top-down effects in kelp forest systems in ways that cannot be predicted by studying the effects of global or local stressors alone. In areas of low sedimentation, increased temperature could result in increased kelp consumption by urchins and reduced kelp biomass, or even shifts to urchin barrens. High sedimentation may increase urchin energetic costs by reducing grazing efficiency or causing urchins to increase movement. Temperature and sedimentation may have synergist negative effects on urchins, if grazing rates cannot increase to meet metabolic needs in the presence of sediment. This project will investigate the effects of increased temperature and sedimentation, separately and combined, on respiration and grazing rates of E. chloroticus on kelp (Ecklonia radiata) in a factorial lab experiment. The control treatment will be kept at ambient temperature (14C) and sediment will be added to reflect the low concentrations that currently occur in New Zealand kelp forests (5 mg/cm2). The future temperature treatments will be 2C above ambient, which is predicted to occur in the 21st century. High sediment treatments will reflect concentrations observed near Auckland where there is currently high terrestrial runoff (35 mg/cm2). The combined effects of temperature and sedimentation on respiration and grazing rates have not previously been tested, but may have critical consequences for trophic dynamics within kelp forests.  The interaction between grazers and kelp is fundamental to the persistence of kelp forests, and the results of this experiment will help make predictions about future changes to kelp forests with climate change.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

We take it for granted that we can remove a wide range of particulate materials, such as dirt, bacteria, and viruses, from water by using filters that usually consist of porous materials, such as sand beds. Filtration is critical to obtaining safe drinking water and other liquids suitable for industrial processing. Nevertheless, instead of filtration there are technologies that use ""fields"", such as gravitational sedimentation, to remove particles and/or separate different kinds of particles. This project investigates how simple chemical gradients, even modest variations in salt concentration, can transport particles and achieve particle removal or separation by size without using filters or gravitational sedimentation. This approach is called diffusiophoresis, and it works for a wide range of particle sizes, is portable, can potentially be operated in field or resource-poor settings, and can be scaled to different sizes as may be required in a variety of applications. Importantly, diffusiophoresis may work for difficult separations of small particles using environmentally benign salts, when traditional filtration or sedimentation methods may be highly inefficient or even ineffective.<br/><br/>The objective of the research is to investigate diffusiophoretic-driven separation processes for a large class of particles, e.g. rigid particles of different size, shape and surface charge, droplets, and vesicles, in confined configurations, which typify a wide range of biological, chemical, and engineering materials and systems, e.g. porous media, structured surfaces and microdevices. Here ""separation"" is considered in its broadest sense, e.g. fractionation of different particles, isolation of particles from the fluid, and transport of particles to specific destinations. Diffusiophoresis refers to the migration of colloidal particles owing to osmotic pressure variations (chemiphoresis) and local electric fields generated by differences in diffusivities of cations and anions (electrophoresis). In the first aspect of this work these ideas are explored in confined geometries and separation of different particles is characterized. In particular, time-dependent diffusiophoretic strategies are described to achieve particle transport over long times. In the second aspect of this work, diffusiophoresis is created using interphase mass transfer, e.g. dissolution of CO2 gas. Consequently, approaches for removing particles in a membrane-less flow approach are described, and a new strategy for field flow fractionation is introduced. Experiments and modeling will be developed for a wide range of particles, particles of all types, rigid/soft particles, bacterial cells, vesicles. The research will achieve fundamental understanding of diffusiophoretic transport in confined spaces and improve macroscopic transport processes."

Manifolds and their geometric properties are not only central to various branches of mathematics but also are ubiquitous as mathematical models in the sciences. Perhaps the greatest example of this is in general relativity, where one of Einstein's great breakthroughs was the discovery that gravity is modeled by the mathematical notion of curvature. This research project focuses on curvature of Riemannian manifolds.  Specific emphasis will be placed on manifolds with density, which can be envisioned as Riemannian manifolds composed of a material with variable, as opposed to uniform, density.  Despite the appearance of manifolds with density in various areas of mathematics and applications, including proof of the Poincare conjecture, they are not yet well understood. This project addresses this gap by helping to develop a geometric theory of manifolds with density.  The project also uses geometry as a theme for a coherent program of educational activities that include: (1) professional development workshops in teaching and learning for in-service secondary education teachers, which will help support teachers in transition to recently developed K-12 standards; (2) innovation in introductory differential geometry curricula at the undergraduate and graduate level that, by emphasizing applications, will also foster new interaction between mathematics and science researchers; and (3) training of mathematics graduate students in best strategies for engaging students in introductory calculus courses.<br/> <br/>Ricci curvature for manifolds with density has been an active area of recent research.  This includes Ricci solitons, which are both fixed points of the Ricci flow and examples of spaces with constant weighted Ricci curvature, and the study of weighted Ricci curvature bounds. The investigator will continue study of the classification of shrinking Ricci solitons in dimension four and higher.  In addition to playing a key role in development of monotonic functionals for the Ricci flow, weighted Ricci curvature bounds also appear in the theory of optimal transport, isoperimetric inequalities, and general relativity and cosmology.   Despite the vast amount of research in Ricci curvature of manifolds with density, there was no corresponding theory of weighted sectional curvature until recently; another goal of this project is to further develop the theory of weighted sectional curvature bounds, including investigating applications and connections to other areas of mathematics.  Recent collaborative work of the investigator also introduces a new geometric approach to manifolds with density that places a certain torsion free affine connection as the fundamental object of study.   This approach not only provides new insight into the weighted Ricci and sectional curvatures but also suggests new natural structures that promise novel results, such as a weighted holonomy group, which will be investigated."

These new tools will advance understanding of the mechanisms of complex biological processes at the molecular level, ultimately facilitating manipulation of these processes to achieve desired outcomes. Thus, the new tools can have significant impact not only in chemistry, but also in biotechnology and medicine. Elements of the research involve close interaction with industrial collaborators, adding a valuable dimension to the educational experience of the graduate and undergraduate students involved.  Dr. Kaltashov and his group are also engaging in outreach activities which seek to expose local high school students to the state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation at UMass-Amherst.<br/><br/>Characterization of biopolymer dynamics and architecture (conformations of individual biopolymer chains and assemblies of multi-unit systems) is both challenging and important for improved understanding of biochemical processes. There is particular need for tools capable of probing transient systems, which are encountered in processes such as protein aggregation, assembly and evolution of quaternary structures, interaction with physiological partners, and enzyme catalysis and transport phenomena.  Improved understanding of these phenomena requires reliable kinetics data and knowledge of conformational changes that accompany transitions.  In order to improve on existing characterization capabilities, the Kaltashov group is developing a new robust, sensitive, and highly selective experimental strategy that uses a combination of liquid chromatography (LC) run under native conditions (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography) with on-line detection by native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). The new LC/MS platform incorporates ion manipulation in the gas phase to enable studies of highly heterogeneous systems (e.g., protein-polymer conjugates).  Incorporation of on-column H/D exchange and chemical reduction reactions enables top-down HDX MS/MS characterization of higher order structure and conformational dynamics of proteins."

""non-compete agreements"") have been used for more than 600 years but have attracted considerable attention from U.S. policymakers in the past quarter-century.  U.S. states including Florida, Idaho, Georgia, Utah, Hawaii, New York, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Illinois have adopted new legislation regarding non-competes. Supreme Court rulings in Texas, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Montana, Colorado, and South Carolina have materially affected the enforceability of non-competes. Moreover, reform efforts are underway in Massachusetts and elsewhere. At the national level, legislation aimed at curbing the use of non-competes for low-wage workers has been considered. The optimal policy prescription for non-compete agreements is hardly straightforward, however, as evidenced by the opposing reforms adopted by various states, some tightening non-compete enforceability whereas others have loosed enforceability. This ambiguity exists in part given that there are multiple stakeholders (workers, firms, and regions) for whom the theoretical impact of non-competes is non-obvious; moreover, the interests of these parties may be opposed. Given both the importance of the policy issue and its theoretical ambiguity, empirical evidence is essential to help guide legislative initiatives.<br/><br/>The project focuses on published empirical articles regarding non-compete agreements in the context of the United States. Levels of analysis include implications for workers, firms, and regions. At the individual level, outcomes analyzed include intra- and inter-state mobility, wages, training, motivation, and specialization. At the firm level, outcomes analyzed include financial performance, innovation, employee retention, and merger & acquisition activity. At the regional and national level, outcomes analyzed include productivity, entrepreneurship, job creation, and knowledge diffusion. Causal evidence across these outcomes at various levels is critiqued by reviewing the identification strategies to produce the findings as well as the datasets used to execute those strategies. These identification strategies include assessing the changes in state-level non-compete enforceability, comparing firms or workers more vs. less likely to be affected by non-competes, using instrumental variables that account for the endogeneity of actions that might be influenced by differential non-compete policies across time and states, and randomized controlled experiments. In addition to causal evidence, stylized facts regarding the use of non-competes from surveys and other fieldwork are assessed."

Some of these chemicals mimic hormones in organisms. These hormone-like chemicals may in turn alter fish behavior, from decreased the vigor of male nest defense to swimming performance in larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). In severe cases of chemical exposure, the entire fish population can collapse. This mixture of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), are a common source of hormone-like compounds in aquatic ecosystems. Over the past few years, CEC use has increased alongside the growth in human population.  Though the effects of single CECs have been explored in fishes, the effects of an entire mixture of CECs has not. The award research will shed light on the pathway chemicals take when present in a complex mixture by cloning and characterizing membrane steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen receptors, to determine if a molecular difference is related to changes in behavioral endpoints. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yoshinao Katsu, a noted expert in endocrine disruption and developmental effects of estrogen-like chemicals, at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. <br/><br/>CECs have been found to affect fecundity, foraging ability, and other apical endpoints. This project will focus on the membrane receptors (i.e. GPR30 and membrane progesterone receptor) activation by an environmentally derived urban CEC mixture in P. promelas. Most membrane steroid hormone receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, thus a second messenger analysis will be conducted to understand the membrane steroid receptors mechanisms and determine if it is linked to CEC-exposure and/or behavioral endpoints. The objectives of this projects are: (1) To clone and characterize membrane steroid hormone receptors in P. promelas; (2) To examine the interaction of the membrane receptor activity with behavioral endpoints under CEC-exposure. This project will support a larger project seeking to characterize and evaluate how environmentally derived CECs mixture from urban sources affect fathead minnow populations in the Laurentian Great Lake Basin. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Less is understood about the underlying genetics, the evolutionary tools for species to adapt and persist through some of these environmental changes. This study aims to identify whether the potential for local adaptation differs across populations within a species range by examining particular genetic characteristics in multiple coral reef fish species. Researchers will compare between populations of fishes at the center of their species range and those at the edges of the species range to test whether peripheral habitats may serve as regions harboring populations with greater adaptive potential. For this project, fish populations at their northern range boundary in the temperate coral reefs of Japan will be compared to populations at the center of their ranges in the tropical reefs of the Philippines and Indonesia. This study aims to increase understanding about the role of edge populations in local adaptation and speciation as well as to gain information to better predict the vulnerability of these species to changes in climate and environment. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of molecular biologist, Dr. James Reimer at the University of the Ryukyus. Dr. Reimer has valuable experience and insight on the population genetics of the marine system in this region and provides access and instruction to key field equipment and laboratory techniques.<br/><br/>This project will consist of the collection of the edge population samples for eight reef fish species in Japan, subsequent DNA extractions, sequencing and finally, analyses. Study species were chosen in part, based on their distribution location and size, reproductive mode, and pelagic larval duration. Researchers suspect that these life history characteristics influence potential patterns in the targeted genetic indicators of adaptation and speciation. Samples collected during this study will be compared with previously collected Philippine and Indonesian samples. Using information generated from RAD sequencing of both population types, researchers will compare levels of genetic variation and the frequency of genes under selection between center and peripheral populations of each species. The findings from this research will help to answer whether these particular indictors of adaptive potential differ between populations within a species range in these reef fish. Further studies can then be conducted to better understand mechanisms of speciation, local adaptation, rapid evolution, as well as to improve the accuracy of future predictions for coral reef health. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Current approaches rely upon delivering gene-editing material to arthropod eggs by embryonic microinjection (EM). However, EM is very challenging, is limited to a small number of arthropod species, and is inefficient even in optimized species. There is a critical need to develop methods for arthropod genetic manipulation that are simple, accessible for many researchers and generally compatible for a large variety of arthropod species.  We have developed a technology called Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo, or ReMOT Control, to specifically deliver gene-editing cargo to the developing arthropod germline by easy injection into female arthropods during egg development. ReMOT Control can bring the power of genetic modification technology to any model or non-model species without the need for injecting embryos, allowing any lab to use these powerful tools for their research questions. Using workshops, social media, symposia, and by making reagents publically available, we will ensure that the ReMOT Control technology is available to any interested researchers. We will also use numerous outreach venues to educate the public about the benefits of these amazing tools. We will develop outreach activities and leverage existing outreach venues that engage K-12 students and members of the public to educate them about how these techniques can benefit their everyday lives. <br/><br/>Technical paragraph: The ReMOT Control technology is based on the identification of small peptide ligands with very specific tropism for the developing arthropod germline. These ligands are used to transduce the CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex to developing eggs after injection into vitellogenic females. In this proposal, we will develop both specific and generalizable ReMOT Control technologies that work across diverse arthropod taxa, opening the true power of this technique to all researchers interested in genetic engineering techniques. ReMOT Control will break down barriers to genetic modification, allowing researchers in diverse animal systems to move beyond correlation to accurately and precisely study gene function. Our overarching conceptual goal for this proposal is nothing less than the complete democratization of gene editing capability for all researchers working in any arthropod system, be it model or non-model. This goal will be realized by the following three Specific Aims: 1) Identify species-specific and universal ligands for applying ReMOT Control technology to diverse oviparous and viviparous arthropod species; 2) Use identified ligands to transduce CRISPR/Cas9 to the host germline for targeted gene deletion and gene knock-in in diverse arthropod species; 3) Disseminate ReMOT Control information, technology and methodology to broad communities of scientists involved in research on animal behavior, animal physiology, insect-plant interactions, sustainable agriculture, and public health. By the end of the research project this transformative technology will bring genetic modification technology within the reach of everyday scientists regardless of their research system."

Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society. <br/><br/>The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. As such, the National Nuclear Physics Summer School represents a community-building activity that provides students with excellent opportunities to interact with leading researchers in the field and to network with their peers. Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience."

Participants will participate in STEM communities to share ideas, receive encouragement, interact with STEM professionals, and receive mentoring from female graduate students. The project will focus on mitigating the underrepresentation of females in STEM by addressing the most documented problems that they face, persistence and self-efficacy, especially nontraditional female students. The researchers will produce evidence for a technology facilitated mentoring and career development model to broaden participation of underrepresented students in STEM graduate education and the workforce. At the same time, they will document an effective intervention to enhance the preparation of prospective STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The researchers propose to use a multiphase mixed-methods approach to address three research objectives: 1) Develop and examine the effectiveness of a STEM peer mentorship program on female undergraduate students' STEM career self-efficacy. 2) Develop and examine the effectiveness of a STEM peer mentoring program on graduate students' mentorship skills that will be transferrable to the workplace. and 3) Develop and examine the effectiveness of a STEM peer mentorship program on increasing undergraduate students' propensity to matriculate to graduate school and the STEM workforce.  Data will be collected from interviews, surveys, and focus groups and analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Research participants will include undergraduate and graduate students from each of the three partnering institutions. The research results are expected to have implications for broadening the participation of underrepresented minority females in STEM at other HBCUs and at other institutions while, at the same time, strengthening mentorship skills of graduate students planning to pursue STEM careers."

A new process known as ""flash sintering"" involves running electrical current directly through the piece, to densify the ceramic and produce a usable component in a matter of seconds.  Initial studies show that many types of ceramics can be fired this way, but these studies have focused on single phase materials, while practical applications often require multiple phases made of different types of ceramics.  This award supports fundamental research to investigate how the electrical and thermal behavior of each component of a multi-phase ceramic responds to flash sintering.  This work will lead to new understanding of the flash sintering process, which will allow for lower cost, higher efficiency processing and manufacture of these critical materials. The processing and the strength of these materials will be studied, to ensure that the components made by this new process are comparable to or better than those made by traditional methods.  The scientific results of the project are integrated into video modules for outreach to elementary and middle school children, to demonstrate the ways that scientists and engineers are studying methods to save energy while making new materials. <br/><br/>Multiple phases are often required for ceramic components in order to improve mechanical strength, enhance thermal conductivity, and increase thermal shock resistance. In contrast to  conventional sintering approaches which expend significant energy heating the sample and furnace cavity, a high applied electric field with current flowing through the sample can be used to densify oxide ceramics in air and without applied pressure and at much lower temperatures. This research program will evaluate how the direct application of electric fields can be used to flash sinter multiphase ceramic powder compacts.  Multicomponent oxide systems with phases of varying electrical/ionic and thermal conductivity are used to determine the role of these material properties in promoting flash sintering. This information is used to create compositional design parameters to optimize flash sintering via incorporation of minor phases.  Mechanical properties of flash sintered multiphase ceramic composites are compared to conventional sintered materials to evaluate any differences, with microstructural characterization by electron microscopy."

As funding agencies continue to encourage and promote team science, it is important to evaluate and synthesize what we know about the consequences of team size. Given scare financial resources, an important science policy issue is how to effectively allocate funding to research teams. For example, given an overall project budget of $1.5M, when is it better to fund a team of three researchers at $500,000 each versus a team of 10 researchers at $150,000 each. On the one hand, funding fewer researchers (with more money per researcher) increases their incentives and makes coordination easier, but reduces the amount of team expertise available. On the other hand, funding more researchers, with less money per researcher, decreases their incentives and makes coordination more difficult, but increases the amount of team expertise available.<br/> <br/>Through an interdisciplinary review of the academic literature on team science, this project advances our knowledge of the benefits and costs of funding teams of varying size. Related topics will be explored as well, including the role of team complexity (e.g., number of disciplines and number of institutions), the life cycle of teams, for example, funding early in the life of the team vs funding later in the life of the team, and the stage of research development, for example, funding early-stage research vs funding late-stage research. To ensure that the evidence identified is robust and reliable, three categories will be used to classify what is known about team size: (1) strong causal inference (e.g., laboratory experiments and field experiments), (2) moderate causal inference (e.g., longitudinal studies with appropriate controls), and (3) weak causal inference (e.g., cross-sectional surveys and observational studies). Based on the evidence, policy recommendations will be made to guide the efficient allocation of resources to team science in order to facilitate complex problem solving, new research discoveries, and technological innovation."

These new methods could significantly enhance the spectral sensitivity in biological NMR samples. Over the 8-week funding period, we will focus on studying protein dynamics in complex cellular environments. Current solid-state NMR techniques suffers from the poor sensitivity because it reads out information on low gamma nuclei (e.g. Carbon-13). This can be solved by using a sensitivity enhancing technique, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR, but this must be done at extremely cold temperatures (100 K), which eliminate dynamic motions. The current collaborative project is to learn and apply fast MAS-NMR which reports on higher gamma nuclei (e.g. Hydrogen-1), performed at room temperature, to study the protein dynamics of amyloid fibrils in their native cellular environments. The broader impact of this project includes applying these methods to study fibrils formed by proteins such as tau, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>This project will encompass a balanced approach that uses the innovative sample preparation methods developed in the home lab and sound methodology and instrumentation to demonstrate significant sensitivity enhancement in biomolecular NMR during the EAPSI research at Zhejiang University.

The intellectual merits of the proposed research lie in establishing fast MAS-NMR as a complementary technique to DNP-NMR for studying proteins at endogenous levels in complex cellular environments. Its broader impacts lie in developing alternative methods that will allow for the further study of intrinsically disordered proteins that make fibrils that are often implicated in disease states.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

The national shortage of STEM teachers is no less of an issue in rural schools than in other parts of the nation, with 23% - 36% unfilled STEM education positions in rural schools. Teachers in small, rural districts are often the only STEM education experts in the district and serve as teachers leading not only in their classrooms, but also STEM education district-wide. A single Dordt College scholar may teach 180 students a year for as many as 40 years, impacting over 7,000 students in a career.

To accomplish these goals, the project will take a two-pronged approach: (a) The project will provide scholarship and cohort experiences targeted to 31 academically strong STEM students to recruit, develop, and support expanded numbers of STEM education candidates prepared to teach in rural settings. Cohort experiences will include 1) shared courses, 2) peer mentoring, 3) growth mindset training, and 4) networking and support during and after degree completion. (b) The project will expand recruiting for students at the K-12 and collegiate levels and enhance the college's professional learning network. Outreach efforts to support this approach will include 1) activities such as camps, visit days and STEM competitions for K-12 students providing enrichment and vocational discernment opportunities, 2) collegiate student outreach for both Dordt College students and local community college students, and 3) teacher networking opportunities including workshops, teacher circles, and professional learning communities.  This project will provide valuable insight into best practices for recruiting and preparing highly qualified STEM teachers. The innovative use of personal learning networks and growth mindset training will provide important insights into the metacognitive and social aspects of potential and early-career STEM teachers."

Surprising connections between these two very different areas of research have been observed in recent years: the principal investigator has been involved in the study of these relationships between high-energy physics and number theory, and she is currently developing new mathematical approaches towards a better understanding of this mysterious connection.  The goal of this project is to extend this connection beyond its original occurrence in quantum field theory to other areas, including statistical physics, string theory, and quantum information. <br/><br/>This project comprises several related investigations. The Feynman diagram calculations used in high-energy physics to describe events in particle physics experiments have a rich and not yet fully understood mathematical structure, involving motives and periods of algebraic varieties, which are objects of study in algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and number theory.  This project aims to develop new techniques to improve understanding of these arithmetic structures in quantum field theory. Similar mathematical structures based on periods and motives of algebraic varieties occur in models of modified gravity developed for applications to cosmology; this new, unexpected development will be investigated in depth as part of the research. The project will also study a framework for a discretization of the ""holographic correspondence"" of string theory, between gravity on a bulk space and conformal field theory on the boundary, built in number-theoretic terms using p-adic numbers. The project aims to develop this p-adic form of the AdS/CFT correspondence into a larger theoretical framework, with a view to explaining in arithmetic terms the emergence of spacetime geometry from information. The work will also continue development of another novel approach to the relation between geometry and information, a construction of anyon models of topological quantum computation based on special solutions (gravitational instantons) of the Einstein equations, with singularities along two-dimensional surfaces. The investigator is also pursuing new number theoretic approaches to quantum statistical mechanics, where the properties of the quantum systems correspond to properties of certain classes of zeta functions studied in analytic number theory, and the equilibrium states of the systems capture Galois symmetries. Finally, the investigator is developing a new approach to distributed computing in theoretical computer science, based on the technique of dynamical triangulations developed in physics as a model of quantum gravity."

The combination of these properties is very promising for various applications, including, for example, devices that convert waste-heat from automobile engines to electricity, low-power devices for mobile applications which dramatically increase the time between battery recharging cycles, and high-speed switching and filtering devices for mobile communication with enhanced data bandwidth. In this research, two specific materials are synthesized by combining the required atoms in a vacuum deposition process. Both of these materials have never been synthesized before, but have been theoretically predicted to exhibit desired electronic properties that may lead to the aforementioned applications. The project determines the process for making these new materials and experimentally quantifies the relevant materials properties to determine their potential applications. Students are trained for careers in the semiconductor and defense industries.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research project studies metal-insulator transitions in unexplored transition-metal nitrides. It is motivated by two recent theoretical predictions: (i) TiMgN2 exhibits a stable ordered phase with a 1.1 eV bandgap and (ii) insulating CrN forms a 2D electron gas for layers of ~4 nm thickness. The project employs epitaxial thin film growth, electron transport measurements, and optical characterization techniques to confirm these predictions and study the composition and quantum-confinement space for the metal-insulator transitions. The two material systems are used as starting points to develop nitrides including ternaries and interface materials with promising opto- and thermo-electric properties. This project has the potential to create a new research field of ""semiconducting transition-metal nitrides"" with potential for transformative impact on the coatings industry by providing a range of new applications for transition-metal nitrides, ranging from refractory semiconductors for extreme environments to high-temperature thermoelectric and optoelectronic materials to new piezoelectric and spintronic thin films.

This equates to an estimated 30 million people in the United States, making it one of the leading causes of disability. OA is a degenerative joint disease involving in the degeneration of joint cartilage. This leads to pain, stiffness, movement problems, and activity limitations. Currently, there is no clinically successful therapeutic to against OA. As a Nobel-prize winning discovery, siRNA can effectively and specifically inhibit disease gene expression, which provides a great therapeutic potential to treat OA. However, it is extremely challenging to deliver negatively-charged siRNAs to infiltrate avascular, dense, negatively-charged tissue matrix, such as cartilage. This research will develop a novel delivery vehicle, which can self-assemble with therapeutic siRNAs and deliver them into matrix-rich tissues in an effective and safe manner.<br/>  <br/>The proposed study will focus on understanding the delicate self-assembly process between rosette nanotubes (RNTs) and siRNA into non-covalent architectures. By mediating the assembly process, the RNT/siRNA architectures will be constructed into siRNA delivery vehicles of various sizes and shapes. Then, their ability to penetrate tissue matrix and deliver siRNA will be analyzed and optimized. This proposal will also identify and manipulate the binding ability of these non-covalent delivery vehicles with tissue matrix molecules to achieve effective and long-lasting inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), a key disease gene during OA progression. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of this siRNA approach against OA will be evaluated in an animal model. In addition, this proposal provides a plan to merge the gap between science and medical education and train the next generation of scientists and clinicians with interdisciplinary knowledge and encourage them to translate science, engineering and technology innovations to satisfy clinical needs. Lastly, collaborating with the Barrington High School (BHS) in Rhode Island, this proposal will develop an outreach plan to introduce nanotechnology to high school students and demonstrate to them how it can help overcome ""real-life problems"" in clinics. Beyond achieving the specific goals of this proposal, this career development plan can significantly improve scientific understanding of the self-assembly of non-covalent structures as well as lay the foundation for the development of the first siRNA therapy to inhibit OA progression."

The question of how stars form is fascinating in itself and has a great impact on several other areas of astrophysics. There is a general consensus that a predominant amount of star formation in our Galaxy takes place in molecular clouds, and specifically in giant molecular clouds (GMC). Consequently, NASA has made multi-million dollar investments in instruments such as HAWC+ on the SOFIA airborne observatory with the specific goal of understanding the turbulent nature of star forming clouds. This project on Blue Waters will use the petascale capabilities of the system to validate theories of star formation by simulating the same processes the NASA's instruments are currently measuring.<br/><br/>This project will carry out simulations on Blue Waters that integrate the ions and the neutrals to reproduce the turbulent, partially ionized gas in which stars form.  Since neutral gas does not couple to the magnetic field, but ionized gas do, the project has built frontline simulation capabilities for simulating two-fluid plasmas. Simultaneously, the project has built theoretical and numerical analysis tools that will enable cross-comparison of simulations with observations. This cross-comparison provides important verification of theories of star formation. Further diagnostics that emerge from the simulations will also be used to motivate more detailed observations. In this fashion, Blue Waters will enable theory, computation and detailed observations to support one another.  In addition, the project intends to combine education in computational astrophysics with code releases of their simulation tools to the greater astrophysics community."

Since star clusters can exist for many billions of years, they are believed to contain large numbers of compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars that formed a long time ago as the remnants of dead massive stars.  This research program at Northwestern University will use state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to study the formation and evolution of these compact objects in a variety of star cluster environments.  The main focus will be on the production of close binaries containing two black holes, which can eventually merge and produce potentially detectable bursts of gravitational waves.  The development of parallel computing techniques and new algorithms will have broad relevance and be of interest to scientists outside of physics and astronomy.  The astrophysics research will be student-oriented and senior students will help train new team members, including undergraduate students.  Education and public outreach activities are also planned that will take advantage of the facilities at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and at Dearborn Observatory on the Northwestern University campus in Evanston. <br/><br/>This project will address a number of key questions concerning the formation and dynamical evolution of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) in dense star clusters. As they experience friction against the background of lighter stars, massive compact objects are expected to rapidly concentrate in the dense inner cores of clusters, where the rates of dynamical interactions are very high. These interactions can both produce binaries and tighten their orbits. In some cases, through successive mergers, perhaps helped by accretion of gas, an intermediate mass black hole could eventually be formed.   Many of the objects formed by these processes are potential multi-messenger sources.  The project will use a hybrid approach of combining Monte Carlo and N-body codes to optimize computing speed, accuracy and realism and overcome the dynamical range problem of simulating very large star clusters in which most of the interesting dynamics happens in a relatively small, high-density central region.   A library of more than an thousand new cluster models will be made publicly available at the conclusion of the project."

A significant contribution of ""The Web of Chemicals and Materials"" is to be a democratized, open source database for industry and academic researchers, public policy makers, and the general public. The creation of a common scaffolding on which researchers from many institutions across the globe can participate and add new utility, holds enormous promise. ""The Web of Chemicals and Materials"" will enable smart sustainable chemistry through providing information of practical use when new, sustainable materials and chemicals are developed. In that sense, the envisioned database is a form of chemi-informatics that can improve the ease and speed by which environmental information and manufacturing efficiency are included in R&D. <br/><br/>""The Web of Chemicals and Materials"" will provide function-based design tools and include orders-of-magnitude more data than are now available, greatly expanding the power of sustainable chemistry. Creating ""The Web of Chemicals and Materials"" as open-source will have global social benefits by enabling creative thinking and research (undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and industrial R&D), using new tools, expanding by orders-of-magnitude the potential to find smarter green materials and chemicals. Start-ups, expansions, and even whole new industries may emerge as ""The Web of Chemicals and Materials"" is used to create new products, more efficiencies, jobs, and economic development. The project envisions future use of the data to support innovative new industrial processes, new research in chemical engineering, earth systems science, and basic energy science.

Diseases are a major cause of coral mortality, yet there is surprisingly little information on the causes and progression of diseases in corals. Currently there is a widespread coral disease outbreak occurring on the reefs of Florida that has already resulted in massive die-offs in multiple coral species. At least 13 species of corals have been affected with heavily impacted species being reduced to less than 3% of their initial populations. This unprecedented outbreak in multiple species of corals provides a unique but time-sensitive (outbreaks are ephemeral) opportunity to address critical questions about diseases in corals. This project will directly examine disease transmission, explore potential pathogens and examine coral defense mechanisms of affected and resistant species. The combined efforts of multiple researchers and agencies, addressing different components of the disease outbreak, will provide much needed answers to questions concerning marine diseases, which will likely be applicable not only to the Florida coral reefs but to coral diseases world-wide. This research will be beneficial to those who rely on coral reefs as a source for food, recreation, and coastal protection. Furthermore, this project is designed to give the next generation of marine scientists the training and tools to combat coral diseases in the future. <br/><br/>Disease is a complex process emerging under specific host-pathogen-environmental conditions, and outbreaks can often be traced to a disturbance in the balance among the three components. The impact of coral diseases will likely increase in both intensity and geographic extent in the future; however, our ability to understand or manage diseases in coral reef ecosystems has been hampered by the lack of a systematic approach to understanding the pathology and pathogenesis of diseases in corals using multiple epidemiological tools. There is surprisingly little information on whether particular diseases are transmissible to neighboring conspecifics, or whether some diseases are infectious across species boundaries. An outbreak of tissue loss disease in multiple species of corals across the Florida reef tract provides a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to address critical questions about disease pathogenesis in corals. The proposed research will directly test the transmission and infectivity, microbiome changes and host specificity of this disease outbreak and use methods previously utilized by members of the team to isolate and identify the causative agent. The research team will work closely with managers in Florida agencies, attend monthly conference calls and provide regular updates about this work. A postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student intern will be engaged in this research and trained in many areas of microbiology research. Researchers will present lectures to the public at venues such as science museums and environmental education facilities throughout the Florida Keys and Florida east coast."

Mercosur is a regional trade agreement among developing countries in South America that is designed to resolve unauthorized migration in a manner that protects the rights of immigrants without compromising national security.  Beginning in 2002 nationals of the affiliated countries could relocate, obtain legal residency, and access civil, economic, cultural, and social rights.  By 2014, nine out of twelve South American countries had affiliated with Mercosur and included the Residency Agreements in their national migration policy.  The widespread adaptation of this policy suggests that policymakers had to build support for these agreements from government officials and migrant advocates within six countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This project analyzes the process that led to the national implementation of the agreements in these six countries to identify the actors and factors that facilitated or hindered the agreement's adaptation as national legislation. This project expands our understanding of how regional migration policy can serve as a tool to reform national immigration law. This project will also identify new models and strategies for addressing unauthorized migration that can inform policymakers and advocates around the world. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project analyzes the impact of Mercosur regionalism in the six countries that negotiated and first adapted the Residency Agreements. Using comparative historical methods, this project identifies the international forces, regional contexts, and the domestic legal, political, and economic factors that facilitated or hindered the passage of the Residency Agreements at the national level. It also identifies the key actors and the policy networks shaping this regional to national policy change. The Co-Principal Investigator conducted N=112 interviews, created a regional and national migration policy database, and compiled an economic growth and trade indicators database. Overall, this research bridges international migration and regionalism literatures and identifies new processes that reform immigration law. This project contributes to the theory by specifying how regional migration policy is a determinant of national immigration policy."

In order to provide maximum benefit to the faculty, this workshop is offered every five years. The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the development of new chemical engineering educators. By targeting faculty within their first five years of their careers, professors can become more effective at all facets of their job as educators and ultimately produce better prepared undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals. <br/><br/>At the 2017 Chemical Engineering Summer School, new faculty will learn best practices in effective teaching, including active learning techniques. The instructors are leaders in chemical engineering education. Furthermore, the participants will also learn about technical (such as safety, sustainability, computational fluid dynamics, process modeling, and emerging topics within the discipline) and non-technical topics (such as communication skills, leadership, ethics, etc.) Historically, around 200 chemical engineering educators, many of whom are within the first five years of their initial faculty appointment and others who are returning as instructors, attend the Summer School. The new educators are able to form strong partnerships with their peers who are in similar stages of their careers. In addition, they meet and interact with senior chemical engineering faculty and receive critical advice on career development matters. To foster interactions, the participating faculty present a poster about their research and education activities at their home institution."

It is not practical to experimentally test all possible changes; it is possible to develop computational rules and methods to accurately predict the effect of most changes, reserving experimental testing for borderline cases. The rules that constrain functional protein sequences, the structures into which they fold, the stability of the structures and the transitions that occur can be organized into an informatics framework that helps distinguish functional from non-functional mutations. The stability and dynamic transitions of protein structures over many mutations are the focus of this research, for which new evaluation methods will be developed and tested. Once the assessment methodologies are validated they will be integrated, along with the raw data and assessment results, within a single, efficient computational platform. The ability to interpret new data and compare it to existing results will not only allow discrimination of beneficial, neutral and deleterious mutations, but provides a resource for a protein-sequence-structure-based understanding of evolution. Informed selection rules will enable better decisions about the importance of saving individual members of endangered species, as well as how different environments affect selection in individual species. <br/><br/>There is a large body of data in protein sequences and structures that can aid in understanding evolution, which is not currently being used. This project will utilize this data in systematic ways to shed new light on evolution.  Protein structures are often modeled in different computational ways; the evaluation of these structure models is critical for expanding the set of reliable structures, since there are huge numbers of possible mutant sequences. Changes to the protein sequences and structures are not fully understood. Part of the difficulty lies in understanding the interactions within their densely packed structures, which have significant interdependences.  Developing new ways to evaluate the effects of dense packing on protein structures is one of the project?s aims. Focusing on the physically interacting clusters within protein structures together with their sequence variants provides rich information about the correlations among amino acid substitutions. This rich data will then significantly advance the ability to distinguish between the important and the unimportant mutations. Progress has been seen with these approaches in the evaluations of predicted structure models at the CASP competitions for protein structure prediction.  These new approaches lend themselves directly to the evaluation of the stabilities of different protein mutants. The evaluation procedures are derived directly from the available sets of protein structures and carefully tested against other known structures. In one important innovation these now include entropies that account for known changes in the structures of individual proteins, i.e. their dynamics.  Capturing these tendencies for changes significantly improves the evaluation of the stabilities of proteins.   Applications to sets of mutants show that unfavorable mutants are either more stable or less stable than the normal cases.  These changes in stability directly affect the ways in which the proteins can move to carry out their functions; evaluating these changes significantly aids the understanding of protein mutations.  This project will yield a uniform way to reliably assess the effects of protein mutations.  This ability will significantly aid in the understanding of many aspects of evolution that remain."

Archaeologists are now able to use geological chemical signatures to identify the origins of objects, such as ceramics. Using a specific type of analysis, X-Ray Fluorescence, painted pottery from various archaeological sites of the Majiayao will be examined in order to identify if painted pottery found can be assigned to either local production or trade, placing these objects in time and space. This research will be conducted at Peking University in Beijing under the supervision of Dr. Jianfeng Cui. Dr. Cui has worked with chemical analysis of material culture previously, and many of the anticipated ceramics to be examined are already at his lab.<br/><br/>This project will specifically examine chemical patterns to determine the provenience of the ceramics, paying close attention to trace elements which can give clues to the relationship between sherds, and where those samples may have come from. An XRF analyzer will be used, followed by analysis and discussion of results. The results will be compared with prior geological knowledge in order to determine local production or importation of these ceramics. From this, potential trade systems can be established to observe which sites might be importing or exporting goods, and if materials are coming from even further away, potential contact and trade with outside groups. This will improve our knowledge of trade in the Neolithic period, and how this might affect interaction and trade in later periods as well.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and China's Ministry of Science and Technology."

It is taken as a given that progress in nanoscale science and technology relies on continuing progress in our ability to make nanoscale images.  This project will employ ultrafast lasers that generate light pulses that are less than a millionth of a millionth of a second in duration in order to generate and detect ultrasound that is over 1000 times higher in frequency than medical or industrial ultrasound.  The research will entail the use of new 2-Dimensional materials to enhance our ability to detect these ultrasonic waves, and will also broaden our understanding of how such high frequency waves behave as they travel around inside solid semiconductor materials.  The project will involve a wide range of undergraduate students in summer research and independent research courses for credit during the semester.  It will also enhance a program for incoming freshmen who are under-represented minorities or first-generation college students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project will seek to demonstrate that coherent acoustic phonons can be used to image buried nanostructures. Previous work on this has shown promise, but issues of low signal to noise due to high attenuation of phonons in the 0.1 to 1 THz range have proved daunting. The work will investigate whether 2-D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides or graphene could prove to be effective transducer layers for a picosecond laser ultrasonic imaging experiment. A second investigation will explore high frequency surface acoustic wave generation and detection by ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments on periodically patterned layered nanostructures. Ultrafast optics has produced the highest surface acoustic wave frequencies ever detected, but a complete understanding of the optical generation and detection is lacking. The work will compare the optical data with computer simulations of the mechanical displacements and the incident/reflected electromagnetic waves. The final component of the project will be a study of phonon attenuation and thermal transport in thin amorphous films and crystals. Time-domain thermoreflectance measurements will be combined with coherent phonon attenuation measurements to form a complete picture of the contribution of long wavelength vibrational modes to thermal transport.  Similarly, the measurement of coherent phonon attenuation in crystalline materials, where the thermal conductivity is already well known, will supply important data that may help answer the question of what the behavior of sub-THz phonons says about a material's thermal conductivity."

The actuator is capable of performing high precision and high speed movements. However, the actuator also tends to exhibit unwanted vibration when operated, greatly reducing its precision. The goal of the project is to implement a command shaping method to eliminate the unwanted oscillation, improving its precision. Potential benefits include developing a reliable actuator that can improve performance in applications where piezoelectric actuators are currently used. The project will be conducted at Tokyo Institute of Technology during the summer of 2017 under the joint supervision of Dr. Gen Endo and Dr. Nabae.<br/><br/>The project will involve vibration attenuation of electromagnetic linear actuators capable of quick sub-millimeter strokes. In general, electromagnetic linear actuators suffer a loss of thrust force as stroke distance increases due to the gap between the electromagnet and the armature. The actuator developed by Dr. Higuchi and Dr. Nabae utilizes an amplification mechanism that increases the stroke distance while maintaining thrust force for the extent of the movement. However, the actuators are prone to unwanted oscillation with amplitudes of hundreds of micrometers, which results in significant residual error when compared to stroke length. The goal of the project is to implement a command shaping method to improve precision. The command shaping method to be used utilizes a system's natural frequency and damping ratio to find impulses that interact destructively to cancel residual vibration. These impulses are then convolved with the system's original reference command to produce a command that causes no residual vibration. Benefits of this project include developing a reliable actuator capable of accurately performing high resolution movements without the drawback of a significant loss of thrust force.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

In 4He it leads to a superfluid where the liquid can flow with viscosity and transport heat without loss.  In some metals it leads to superconductivity where electric currents are carried without loss - offering the potential for power distribution without the losses that occur in current power lines.  BEC has also been observed in super-cooled atoms which could lead to more precise atomic clocks that power the global positioning system.   Other, yet to be discovered systems, may show equally fascinating and important behavior.

The large departure of the polarization of the nuclear spins from the Boltzmann distribution observed previously are investigated down to lower temperatures and at higher hydrogen atom concentrations in an attempt to reach full Bose-Einstein condensation. Although in previous experiments the spin-lattice relaxation was found to be several hours, it was not possible to fully saturate the transition between the two lowest hyperfine states. This anomalous behavior is fully investigated. Hole burning experiments in a magnetic field gradient also are performed to determine the hydrogen atom mobility as Bose-Einstein condensation occurs.

In this project, the EAPSI fellow will study developing and applying hierarchical modeling concepts in these multiscale simulations. This research will be conducted in the collaboration with Dr. Viet Ha Hoang at Nanyang Technological University. Dr. Hoang has an extensive experience in developing hierarchical models for multiscale problems. The researcher will learn these techniques and work with Dr. Hoang closely to develop these hierarchical methods for flows in fractured media.

The computational cost associated with local solves can be drastically reduced if one can take into account the neighboring coarse-grid information and local solutions.  Many neighboring coarse-grid blocks share similar features and effective permeabilities of the neighboring coarse-grid blocks are close to each other. In this research, hierarchical approaches will be employed for local problems to reduce the computational cost by using different resolution in different coarse-grid blocks and combining these multi-resolution solutions to achieve an accurate approximation of the effective properties. These effective coefficients will be used to simulate the global flow.

Men's presence in care work jobs remains low despite job growth in education and health care and the decline in traditionally male-dominated manufacturing sectors. Previous research has debated whether rigid gender attitudes or material concerns such as higher wages accounts for the low numbers of men in care work jobs. Moreover, jobs have increasingly polarized; wages, working conditions, and job security have declined in care work jobs since the 1970s. This polarizing pattern of care work job growth is characterized by racial disparity, with racial minorities more likely to occupy low-paying jobs. This project has two aims: first, to empirically examine why and how men enter different kinds of care work jobs, and second, to investigate the factors contributing to the racial disparity in the paid care work sector under the context of increasing job polarization. By shedding light on the cultural versus structural debate as well as the intersecting inequalities by race and class along with men's presence in the paid care work sector, findings from this project will help develop policy suggestions about how to encourage more men to enter care work jobs while closing the racial disparity in the paid care work sector.<br/><br/>To address whether men?s avoidance of care work jobs is motivated primarily by cultural concerns - care work jobs are typically labeled as ""women's work"" - or by material concerns, the first part of this project empirically tests the specific mechanisms related to gender attitudes, human capital, and labor market positions behind men's entry into various kinds of care work jobs. The project uses nationally representative, individual-level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979.  Event history models will examine men's transition into first care work jobs. The second part of this project explains a phenomenon that has been documented by previous research - that is, the polarization pattern of paid care work jobs has been highly racialized, with whites increasingly concentrating in high-paying and racial/ethnic minorities in low-paying care work jobs. The analysis aims to elucidate the extent to which this racialized pattern is driven by racial disparity in education and labor market experiences, and/or by racial discrimination. Using data from NLSY79 and 97, the study will show how socioeconomic determinants of men's entry into high-paying and low-paying care work jobs have changed in the ""new economy"" by comparing two cohorts of young men (late Baby Boomers and early Millennials) who joined the workforce under different labor market conditions. Findings from the second part will illuminate increasing racial and class inequalities behind the celebrated trend towards gender occupational integration. Since paid care work sectors are projected to continue their strong growth in the U.S., insights from this project can inform how labor market inequalities by race and class may decline or intensify in the future."

The traditional method for fish length estimations is diver-based, where a researcher observes fish underwater and records length estimations by hand. Due to the optical properties of water these estimations are difficult and subject to researcher biases. Generally, fish lengths are averaged and grouped into a few size classes (Ex. 5 - 10cm, 11 - 20cm, 21 cm+). To increase the accuracy underwater length estimates, stereovideo cameras can be used, where two cameras are run in parallel and software calculates lengths of objects of interest to the nearest millimeter, a magnitude of greater accuracy than diver-based visual census techniques. The problem with using these systems over traditional methods is the high cost, which prevents widespread use.<br/><br/>Accurate fish length records are critical for fishery resource managers in determining the overall health of coral reef systems to ensure that they remain healthy for future generations.

It is the premier dissemination forum for interdisciplinary research linking computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, and health informatics. Its mission is to support advanced research, training, and outreach. It brings together leading researchers, practitioners, and students around the world to promote novel scientific findings in bioscience and to deliver new knowledge for societal impact. The past few decades have seen tremendous growth in the scale and complexity of biological and medical data including recent mainstream recognition of big data challenges. However, the development of synergy in bioinformatics, computational biology, and biomedical informatics research has been difficult. Thus, it is important to cultivate the new culture when training younger generations. This NSF grant will provide support to about 20 top junior U.S.-based professionals (students and recently graduated post-doctoral fellows) to participate in the conference. In addition, because women and underrepresented minority groups have relatively low participation in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB), ACMBCB2017 will expand its ""Women in Bioinformatics"" organization to strongly encourage participation from women and other underrepresented junior researchers.  Two senior professionals will be invited to share their experience and wisdom in career development, and to serve as mentors to facilitate young professional groups with the goal to continually build the community throughout the year. The goal of these activities is to increase the participation of junior researchers; train the next generation of researchers and educators in computer science, biological science, biomedical science and other related areas; broaden the diversity from underrepresented groups in BCB; and provide mentorship by senior researchers serve to young professionals to improve bioinformatics, computational biology, and health informatics community building in ACM SIGBio.<br/><br/>The ACMBCB2017 conference will showcase leading-edge research on new technologies and techniques around gathering, processing, analyzing, and modeling of data and information for a variety of scientific, clinical, and healthcare applications, from bench to bedside. It will provide well planned and organized activities such as workshops, tutorials, oral sessions, and poster sessions for researchers from different disciplines to interact, to foster discussion and collaboration. The ACMBCB2017 materials, including contributions from the junior researchers (e.g., short research proposals and presentations) will be shared on website ACMBCB2017 (http://acm-bcb.org/2017/)."

It is prevalent in theoretical physics, in particular, conformal field theory and string theory, which attempt to provide a unified description of all the forces of nature. While a vertex operator algebra is most often considered over the field of complex numbers or fields of characteristic zero, little is known about those over a field of prime characteristic p. A better understanding of vertex operator algebras over fields of prime characteristic plays an important role in the study of modular representations of finite groups, rational vertex operator algebras, and rational conformal field theory. This project will be conducted at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at Osaka University under the mentorship of Prof. Kiyokazu Nagatomo, who specializes in the theory of vertex operator algebras which correspond to conformal field theory in physics.<br/><br/>In vertex operator algebra theory, rationality is considered to be among the most important concepts. The primary interest of this project is to investigate the rationality of modular vertex operator algebras associated with the minimal series of the Virasoro algebra. The goal is to extend some existing results from the fields of characteristic zero to fields whose characteristic satisfies a certain conjectured relation. The plan is to investigate the singular vectors of the Verma modules over such fields. <br/><br/>This NSF EAPSI award provides an international research opportunity to a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)."

In the development of HIV prevention strategies, patient adherence has been a major limitation. One factor that may cause poor adherence is prescribed drug regimen that require frequent dosing. In addition, individuals may be burdened with unwanted side effects that result from large doses and systemic toxicity. Nanotechnology is of significant interest to help address these concerns. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Xing-Jie Liang at the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology of China. As an expert in nanomedicine, Dr. Liang will provide guidance on the design and characterization of dendrimers, a form of branch-like nano-carriers, to be administered to the colorectum as drug delivery systems for HIV prevention. This work will establish greater insights into nano-scale drug delivery and develop the framework to produce more safe, convenient and effective pharmaceutical interventions. <br/><br/>Exposure to HIV through unprotected sexual activity remains the primary cause of transmission worldwide. Currently, the only approach approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for HIV prevention is orally administered pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the form of a combinational drug product. With oral PrEP, relatively large dosages are required to achieve effective concentrations in mucosal tissues. Additionally, the entire body is being exposed to antiretrovirals, raising concerns of systemic toxicity. Together with a strict once-a-day dosing regimen, these conditions contribute to overall poor patient adherence behaviors that may result in ineffectiveness of treatment. Therefore, significant research is currently being conducted to develop effective, safe, and long-acting PrEP formulations. Based on the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, they show great promise in their ability to aid in the development of these applications. Dr. Xing-Jie Liang is an expert in nanomedicine with extensive experience in drug delivery and active cell and tissue targeting to enhance drug safety and efficacy. The project will be guided by the following aims: 1) engineer dendrimers labeled with established cell penetrating peptides; 2) characterize dendrimers by imaging and spectral analysis and 3) investigate cellular uptake in intestinal cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The completion of this work will establish a deeper understanding of nanoengineering and cell targeting techniques to potentially serve as interventions for HIV and within other areas of biomedical research.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China."

This project will help to address gaps through syntheses and new analyses of existing datasets and the piloting of a novel survey. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning and training.<br/><br/>The study will advance research on foreign faculty by conceptualizing a broader notion of foreign status that goes beyond nationality of birth and education to include cultural characteristics, family composition and location, local community engagement, and international professional experience. The project scope will focus on the analysis and integration of extant data, and in so doing make clearer the value and limitations of those datasets. Methodologically, the project will use an innovative social network design to collect and integrate various national datasets to capture and analyze the relationships among a) dimension of foreign status; b) professional network structure, cultural composition and resources; and c) work history, satisfaction, mobility, mentoring, and productivity, among others. The study will be conducted in three integrated parts: 1) expanded analysis of existing NSF-sponsored survey datasets to investigate how foreign status and network structure and outcomes are related; 2) collection, merging and analysis of extant scientist data to determine gaps and complementarities critical for longer-term data collection; and 3) initial data collection to develop new survey designs and validate new metrics.

It will exploit multiple dimensions of commonality between instances of such applications through fast content caching and retrieval, and multicast services. (ii) ICN for the Wireless Edge: explore how information exchange via caching and markets would be accomplished, and how to design secure and privacy-preserving data transfer methods. A key novelty is the use of proactive secure caching that learns the value of applications and ensures they are cached ahead of demand.

These interactions typically involve adhesive protein surfaces making large contacts that are hard to disrupt. The result is that traditional small molecule drugs cannot sufficiently break up these interactions; thus these interactions have been drugged ""undruggable."" In the past few decades, peptides have emerged as an alternative due to their large size are ability to interact with large surface contact area in protein-protein interactions. There are many well developed technologies for identifying potential peptide therapeutics, this work will focus on developing technology to expand the chemical diversity of peptides available in the most powerful technique: mRNA display. This work will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Hiroaki Suga at the University of Tokyo. Dr. Suga is a world expert in mRNA display and peptide ligand discovery whose expertise will prove invaluable for completion of the project.<br/><br/>Many biologically relevant peptides and proteins contain macrocycles to stabilize tertiary structures and protect against proteolytic degradation. Researchers have developed several macrocyclization techniques to create peptide mimics of biological structures, most notably: lactam bridging, Grubbs metathesis, dibromoxylene cyclization, azide-alkyne ""click"" chemistry, and head-to-tail cyclization to name a few. Many of these peptides have even moved to clinical trials in several disease models. Though all these methods create large macrocyclic peptides, all require a bridging moiety of substantial size. Evolutionarily pressures have optimized biological macrocycles to create many surface contacts in ligand-protein interactions; large bridging moieties can sufficiently disrupt this optimized network negating any benefits of stability conferred. This project will focus on integrating a method of methylene bridge disulfide creation into the peptide ligand discovery platform of mRNA display. This platform is far and away the most powerful method of peptide ligand discovery, capable of simultaneously creating and screening 1013 unique peptides. Because the methylene bridge cyclization introduced in the proposed work is only a single carbon, this method will be offer a tool to create large libraries of peptides having a minimally disrupting bridging moiety. This technology will be initially applied to a screen for trypsin inhibitors and will ultimately be be added to the growing toolkit for identifying peptide ligands inhibiting protein-protein interactions.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by the NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Much has been learned about these processes in recent years. However, despite these successes, our knowledge of what happens on the molecular level during fertilization and the initiation of embryonic development is limited. For example, it is not known what molecules on the surface of the egg and the surface of the sperm start the fertilization process and allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. This project will investigate these molecular interactions taking place between the egg and sperm in collaboration with Dr. Rommel Mathias, an expert in studying protein-protein interactions, at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. The primary goal is in the identification of molecules on the surface of the egg that are required for sperm binding and fusion during fertilization.<br/><br/>In all animals, the initial conserved fertilization signal is a calcium wave that sweeps the entire egg. This calcium wave is initiated at sperm-egg fusion by a Src family tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C (PLC) gamma and it functions to both block polyspermy and initiate zygote development. The upstream protein interactions that influence the activation of Src and PLC are mostly unknown. Using a protein binding domain from the phospholipase C gamma enzyme, this project will identify proteins that interact with phospholipase C gamma during fertilization in the starfish. The starfish is an excellent model system for fertilization research because of the large quantity of easily accessible gametes, the success of in vitro fertilization, and the similarity of the known fertilization signaling pathways to that of humans. The Mathias lab specializes in viral-host protein interaction studies utilizing mass spectrometry and their expertise will be applied to identifying these fertilization-specific protein interactions using a state-of-the-art Thermo Fusion Orbitrap mass spectrometer.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Carbon nanomaterials have unique physical properties, which make them suitable candidates for applications in the MIR and THz range. Depending on the type of carbon nanotubes, they strongly absorb light in the entire frequency range from the visible to the THz region.

Depending on chirality, SWCNTs strongly absorb radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Recently, the fabrication of wafer-scale films of aligned, densely packed, and chirality-enriched SWCNTs has been developed using slow vacuum filtration of SWCNT solution. These films maintain the extraordinary properties of one-dimensional/anisotropic SWCNTs in a macroscopically aligned film, bringing the extraordinary properties of the nanomaterial to a technologically useful macroscopic scale. For instance, depending on the polarization of radiation with respect to the nanotube alignment in the film, one can strongly absorb or completely transmit incident radiation over a broad frequency range, including the MIR and THz regions. Graphene also absorbs light in the entire electromagnetic spectrum, but the carrier density can be tuned by electrostatic gating to control the absorption of light in the MIR and THz regions.

These algae, known as Symbiodinium, live within the tissue of the host coral. Okinawan octocorals are largely understudied, and in some species, the host coral's associated symbionts have yet to be identified. Corals are threatened by a variety of factors, many of which induce a breakdown of this symbiosis (known as coral bleaching), which can result in the death of the coral.  Following the approximate 50% loss of all Indo-Pacific coral cover since the 1980's, there is a greater need to identify Symbiodinium diversity, as not all symbiont types are equally susceptible to environmental threats. This study aims to examine unknown diversity by identifying the Symbiodinium populations associated with these understudied octocorals around Okinawa, a location of particular interest because it is the northernmost distribution limit for many of these species. This work will be done at the Molecular Invertebrate Systematics and Ecology Lab at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan, in collaboration with Dr. James Reimer, whose expertise with both Japanese octocorals and Symbiodinium will be a big asset.<br/><br/>With the use of SCUBA and/or snorkeling, octocorals from a range of genera will be identified and sampled from locations surrounding Okinawa, specified by Dr. Reimer and his lab members.

Scholars make comparisons across time and place to better understand a wide range of political and social phenomena. One of the central techniques that social scientists often use is the controlled comparison, whereby scholars hold potential explanatory factors constant across different cases to help them assess their contribution to particular outcomes.  This approach has been central to some of the most influential works of social science. It has helped scholars explain everything from why some countries are rich and some are poor to why some countries are democratic and some are authoritarian. Yet even as controlled comparisons have produced lasting insights, they are not the only form of comparison that scholars utilize to answer important questions about social and political life. There is little guidance, however, on how to develop and execute comparisons that do not rely on the controlled case model, and what types of insights alternative comparison models can offer. The goal of this project is to lay out just such guidelines. To do so, this project will explore two of the most fundamental questions in the study of politics: (1) how and why scholars decide on what they compare, and (2) how the methodological assumptions scholars make about why and how they compare shape the knowledge they produce. By answering these questions, the project will create new resources for future students and researchers to draw upon in their efforts to advance knowledge.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project aims to reimagine three central components of the comparative method in order to develop new logics for comparative research designs that move beyond traditional controlled comparison designs. First, it will encourage political scientists to think critically about what a case is by challenging dominant norms and encouraging scholars to think of processes, practices, meanings, and concepts as cases to be compared. Second, the project will expand the notion of what it means to compare. It aims to push scholars to conceptualize comparison as a method that includes approaches beyond controlled comparison, including greater attention to the experiences of subjects being studied and the ways those experiences re-order social worlds. Finally, the project proposes to expand the explanatory goals of comparative research by de-emphasizing variations in outcomes and opening up variations in political processes, meanings, and concepts as similarities or differences to be explained. To achieve these goals, this project will convene a workshop on comparative methods, and produce an edited volume based on contributions emerging from the workshop that will serve as a resource for scholars looking to conduct non-controlled comparisons to guide future scholars in new research directions."

Squid are an ideal behavioral study organism due to their complex mating displays and behaviors. Populations of squid are directly affected by changes in the environmental factors that support reproduction, including coral bleaching and river runoff. The study will be conducted with Dr. Yuzuru Ikeda at the University of the Ryukyus and will benefit from his expertise in laboratory and field-based cephalopod behavior research. Nearby reefs and sophisticated university facilities will allow completion of two complementary projects. Project 1: field surveys of oval squid population sizes in native reef habitats adjacent to human populations of different size; Project 2: a laboratory study of ideal reproductive habitats for oval squids. Results from these projects can inform future conservation efforts by bolstering understanding of human effects on common fishery species. <br/><br/>The field and laboratory experiments will examine the impact of urbanization on the reproductive behavior and population size of oval squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana). Project 1: observational studies will be conducted in the reefs near urbanized Okinawa Island and the remote reefs of the Yaeyama Islands to document oval squid egg clusters, sub-adults, adults, and coral species abundances. Project 2: the researcher will perform behavioral studies of squids in artificial reef environments. Groups of 8-10 adult oval squid will experience four habitat conditions ranging between ""poor"" (empty) and ""enriched"" (artificial seaweed and corals). Each will be observed daily for mating and spawning behaviors, including courtship signaling, spermatophore transfer, number of eggs, and egg condition.  Squid communities are expected to be smaller in urbanized areas, while squid in ""poor"" tank conditions will show a smaller number of mating behaviors and egg clusters. This project will elucidate the effects of human activity on squid reproduction and inform conservation measures that could be applicable to many reef ecosystems. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

The impact of this research is far-reaching, as this technique could allow for the replacement of gasoline removed from the Earth's crust as a fuel source. A precursor to many other chemicals, naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In today's industry, it is removed from coal tar, and to a lesser degree, petroleum, during the various refining and distillation steps. Research performed by our lab group has demonstrated that certain nanostructured metal particles can convert carbon dioxide and water into gasoline using visible light. Recent research has demonstrated that naphthalene can be produced with a cobalt catalyst when methanol is used instead of water. These methods are significantly cleaner than the refining and distillation steps that are currently used, as well as being able to produce target compounds depending on the simple starting materials. This project will expand upon the known metals that can be used to perform these conversions by using ruthenium instead of more common metals. This research will be conducted at the National University of Singapore under the invaluable mentorship of Dr. Boon Siang (Jason) Yeo.<br/><br/>Naphthalene and normal-alkane hydrocarbons are produced during the refining and distillation steps of coal tar and petroleum.

Recently we have discovered that when methanol is used instead of water in a cobalt-containing system, the single product of naphthalene results. This project will continue the work done previously to test ruthenium as the final Fischer-Tropsch metal in both water and methanol systems.<br/><br/>This award, under East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore."

These catalytic centers are composed of the most evolutionary ancient components of the ribosome; all other ribosomal components accreted onto their surface as the ribosome and life evolved. The evolutionary process of the ribosome can be seen in the structures of extant species; multi-cellular eukaryotes have the largest ribosomes, within their structure is the ribosome of single-cellular eukaryotes, which contains the structure of the smallest ribosome belonging to prokaryotes.

Converting the carbon dioxide to fuels and chemical products reduces CO2 emissions and provides an alternative source of carbon for fuels and chemical feedstocks. One way this can be accomplished is using electricity and a ""helper"" molecule known as a catalyst to find an energy efficient reaction path in a chemical process called electrocatalysis.  Two major challenges associated with electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are that the reactions are slow and that it is difficult to control the distribution of reaction products. In this project, Dr. Hailiang Wang is developing a new category of highly efficient catalysts for fast and selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons. The catalytic sites of these materials are molecular in nature, so that synthetic chemistry can be utilized to accurately tailor the catalyst structures. The structures are further optimized at one the billionth of a meter level (the nanometer scale) to enhance their catalytic performance. The catalysts are insoluble in the electrolyte solution so that they can be easily separated. Dr. Wang is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, which include a new outreach program named ""Catalyzing a Sustainable Energy Future"" based on the Energy Sciences Institute on Yale West Campus, are directed at improving the education of a diverse body of pre-college students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers.  <br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Hailiang Wang of Yale University is designing metal-porphyrin molecular based heterogeneous electrocatalyst materials for efficient CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons. The approach combines the atomic-level structural tunability of molecules with the practical handling advantages of heterogeneous catalyst materials, to render new electrocatalyst materials with higher performance. The metal-porphyrin molecular structures are tailored by varying metal ions, introducing electronic substituents, incorporating proton donating groups, and designing selective intermediate stabilizing structures. The electrocatalytic performance are further enhanced by anchoring the metal-porphyrin molecules onto ancillary nanostructures. In-situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies under electrochemical conditions and theoretical calculations and computational simulations are also performed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms.

This research project will broaden our understanding of a class of such ""shape space"" problems in which the geometric objects are surfaces (i.e. flat or curved two-dimensional shapes) or closely related spaces built from higher-dimensional pieces assembled in a two-dimensional pattern. These are natural examples to study because of the frequent appearance of surface geometry in a wide variety of mathematical problems and applications.  In addition to contributing to mathematical knowledge, the computational and visualization components of this project will produce striking images of mathematical objects that exhibit their intricate structure and complexity in a way that can be appreciated by scientists and non-scientists alike.<br/><br/>A locally homogeneous geometric structure on a compact manifold determines a holonomy representation, which is a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the manifold into a Lie group.  The resulting map from the space of geometric structures to the space of group representations is always a local homeomorphism, but apart from a few classical examples (such as constant curvature geometries), the global behavior of the holonomy correspondence is not well understood.  The investigator will contribute to our understanding of this basic problem by studying cases in which analytic methods can be brought to bear.  For example, families of Anosov representations of surface groups in complex Lie groups are amenable to study through Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory, and through the application of tools from complex-analytic Teichmueller theory.  In other cases, such as real projective structures on compact surfaces and generalizations thereof, geometric structures can be understood in terms of the solutions of a system of partial differential equations on the underlying manifold, allowing geometric questions to be attacked through techniques such as asymptotic analysis, barriers, and maximum principles."

A familiar example of an electrochemical cell is the battery, in which electrons are released from a chemical species that has stored electrochemical energy. The electrons travel via a controlled pathway to complete the electrical circuit and provide electricity.  As the electrons are negatively charged, positively charged ions (for example, battery acid) must simultaneously converse a physical barrier to maintain charge neutrality. A solid-state polymer electrolyte separator provides these controlled and separate pathways that simultaneously channel electrons and ions.  In an environment that is often quite corrosive and reactive, this separator must be chemically, electrochemically, thermally, and mechanically stable. To minimize unwanted energy and power losses, resistances to the transfer of electrons must also be minimized, which can be accomplished via molecular-level design of the separator.  This project focuses on molecular design and optimization of a relatively unexplored class of polymer electrolyte separators, called bipolar membranes.  A bipolar membrane incorporates a junction of positively and negatively charged molecules at a shared interface for water splitting electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical water splitting enables conversion of transient renewable power to chemical energy for long term storage. This project will engineer the bipolar junction on a molecular-level scale to minimize energy losses, with potential impact to a number of electrochemical technologies.<br/><br/>This project aims to overcome some of the current limitations of bipolar membranes by correlating interfacial area in the bipolar junction to water-splitting kinetics and mass transport related resistances of water and ion species. Uncovering this correlation is anticipated to yield lower resistant bipolar membranes that translate to lower energy footprint electrochemical reactor-separator processes. The central hypothesis of the project posits that an inverse, commensurate relationship exists between cell overpotential for water dissociation and bipolar junction interfacial area. Testing the central hypothesis will be accomplished by fabricating precisely defined bipolar junction interfaces via two approaches: i.) constructing 2D bipolar junctions on substrate surfaces through block copolymer lithography and ii.) nanopatterning bulk membrane surfaces through nanostructured molds afforded from block copolymer templates. The expected outcomes will reveal how the salient structural features of bipolar junction interfaces govern electrochemical cell performance when splitting water.  Finally, the project will contribute to the training of a future STEM workforce prepared to address future challenges in the water-energy nexus, and it will spark 8th and 9th grade students' interest in math with outreach activities that illustrate the utility of algebra principles to materials design."

Pharmaceuticals that are in the molecularly-disordered, or amorphous, state are advantageous compared to molecularly-ordered, or crystalline, forms of the same drug because the amorphous material has higher solubility in water and higher bioavailability. Consequently, lower doses can be used, decreasing both cost and the probability of toxic side effects.  However, amorphous pharmaceuticals are generally not stable and can crystallize, albeit slowly, from the amorphous state.  The aim of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research project is to gain a fundamental understanding of crystallization from the amorphous state and to develop new processing strategies to make stable forms of amorphous pharmaceuticals. The results are anticipated to facilitate development of new amorphous drug formulations and to, thus, benefit the U.S. economy and society.

Flash scanning calorimetry will facilitate exploration of a wide range of very high cooling rates or short isothermal crystallization/nucleation times in order to establish the bounds of the potential for making specific compounds into stable glasses. Spray drying, vapor deposition, and melt extrusion methods will also be investigated as processing paths to create stable glassy pharmaceuticals. Crystallization kinetics from the glassy state will be studied by calorimetry, and the relationship to glassy dynamics, as obtained from dielectric spectroscopy and viscoelastic methods, will be established."

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The LHC has recently begun its second extended data-taking period (Run II), and it is hard to envisage a more exciting time in particle physics. Run II will test whether the recently discovered Higgs boson is fully consistent with our current expectations, or whether it behaves in ways that transcend our best current theories.  Another primary aim of the LHC program is to seek a microscopic theory of Dark Matter, which is currently poorly understood, and to understand whether there exist any interactions of Dark Matter with more traditional kinds of matter. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. All of these analyses require precise theoretical predictions in order to extract useful information from the data, and Professor Williams will carry out detailed analyses along these lines. Specifically, Professor Williams will perform new calculations using recently developed methods which will result in a much smaller theoretical uncertainty than those which have previously been used. The results of his calculations will be released publicly to both experimental and theoretical users and will be utilized in experimental analyses. Professor Williams will also establish an educational outreach program, targeting a minority population (Native Americans) which are one of the most under-represented in the sciences.   By working directly with SuperIntendents from the local Native-American school districts, Professor Williams will, over the lifetime of the award, arrange after-school programs and as well as field trips to the Fermilab National Accelerator laboratory. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Williams will perform cutting-edge calculations at Next-to-Next-to Leading Order accuracy and beyond, and implement these results into a publicly available computer code, MCFM. The primary focus will be key LHC processes such as diboson production and those related to studies of the Higgs boson. Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effects will be included, typically in the form of anomalous couplings, allowing for applications in experimental analyses. Prof Williams will also develop methods for regulation of infrared singularities and apply this techniques to new processes of phenomenological relevance."

The 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC), and associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), on Animal-Microbe Symbioses seek to promote the presentation and discussion of the most important and timely research in this exciting area of biology. The range of topics is broad, covering theoretical to the applied approaches, using examples involving viruses, fungi and bacteria, found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. The conference and seminar invite scientists to attend, present and participate fully in the examination of these topics, and to return to their own work with new insights, ideas and collaborations.<br/><br/>Research on the beneficial microbiomes of animals has recently become highly active, due in part to major advances in methods for studying uncultivable organisms, such as molecular biological techniques (e.g., the 'omics') and imaging methods that combine information about identity and function at the single-cell level. These and other new approaches are providing novel and unexpected insights into mutualistic associations between animals and their microbiota. There is an unusually young and enthusiastic demographic for this field that has been strengthened by the attraction of established investigators from areas like immunology, behavior and developmental biology. A vital factor helping to drive the impact of microbiome research is a recurring, high-quality conference combining the best of both mammalian and non-mammalian model systems, with an eye to applying the newest technological advances in bioinformatics, sequencing, mathematical modeling and imaging approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying them. Such a conference, while focusing on animal-microbe symbioses, should also including allied fields like plant symbioses and pathogenic microbiology whose different viewpoints can inspire novel ideas. The 2017 GRC/GRS are designed to develop new interactions that will drive this kind of intellectual synthesis. These two meetings play the critical role of enhancing and assuring the participation and visibility of both early career and senior scientists by showcasing short oral presentations along with lectures by invited speakers. This is an exciting time to be part of such a biological adventure, and the perfect opportunity for the GRC/GRS in Animal-Microbe Symbioses to have a significant impact."

Excitement about these systems has been accompanied by serious concerns about their opacity and the threats that they pose to privacy, fairness, and other values. Recognizing these concerns, the investigators seek to make real-world automated decision-making systems accountable for privacy and fairness by enabling them to detect and explain violations of these values. The technical work is informed by, and applied to, online advertising, healthcare, and criminal justice, in collaboration with and as advised by domain experts.<br/><br/>Addressing privacy and fairness in decision systems requires providing formal definitional frameworks and practical system designs. The investigators provide new notions of privacy and fairness that deal with both protected information itself and proxies for it, while handling context-dependent, normative definitions of violations. A fundamental tension they address pits the access given to auditors of a system against the system owners' intellectual property protections and the confidentiality of the personal data used by the system. The investigators decompose such auditing into stages, where the level of access granted to an auditor is increased when potential (but not explainable) violations of privacy or fairness are detected. Workshops and public releases of code and data amplify the investigators' interactions with policy makers and other stakeholders.  Their partnerships with outreach organizations encourage diversity."

The results of this analysis will yield insights into why different animal groups dominate the world's ecosystems and adapt to a large variety of lifestyles. The fellow will measure Mesozoic dinosaur and mammal fossils and calculate muscle lever arms, an indicator of general movement capability. These data will be used to model the rates and patterns of lever arm change over time and test for associations with environmental change. The fellow will visit the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing to work with Dr. Xu Xing, one of the leading experts on vertebrate paleontology, and collect data from Chinese dinosaur and mammal species.<br/><br/>The origins of biological innovations, such as terrestrial colonization and powered flight, are pivotal events in vertebrate evolution, and are often coupled with changes in locomotor morphology. Yet, little is known about how the rate of such changes are due to trait-environment interactions. The overall objective of this project is to quantify the rate of locomotor change in Mesozoic mammals and dinosaurs. The fellow hypothesizes that high rates coincide with shifts in physiology and the environment. Dinosaur locomotion has remarkable parallels with mammal locomotion and thus provides a natural experiment for investigating how trait-environment interactions influence biological innovation. We will collect morphological data on the locomotor lever-arms from Mesozoic mammal and dinosaur fore- and hind-limbs. The simplicity of these parameters allows rate shifts to be modeled across clades that would be undetectable using species-specific models.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and China's Ministry of Science and Technology."

The project compares the experience of youth from undocumented and documented immigrant families.  The legal-illegal dichotomy ingrained in U.S. immigration policies is conceptually limiting for understanding the diversity of citizenship experiences for the children of immigrants. A more nuanced analysis is now required to further uncover the generational effects of parental undocumented status on their U.S. born children with citizenship. This type of research offers new ways of understanding the intergenerational transmission of parents' social background to their children and develops insight into how local context can mediate and shape the lived experiences of immigrant origin youth. This research holds the potential to help policy makers, educators, and the wider public understand the social implications of undocumented status for future generations. <br/><br/>This comparative qualitative study will interrogate intra-group differences related to the legal status of Mexican-American families residing in New York City. The hypothesis guiding this research is that parents? undocumented status creates a social context that is inheritable or passed on to subsequent generations. Interviews with both undocumented and documented families coupled with ethnographic observations of a subset of these families will provide new insights into the strategies undocumented families employ in their daily lives. This study takes a multi-level ecological approach by gathering observations across both the individual and contextual level. On the individual level, the study will provide a descriptive portrait of the everyday lives of undocumented and documented Mexican-American parents as they raise their families. On a contextual level, this study will detail the highly variable experiences of undocumented parents and their children resulting from factors such as neighborhoods, schools, and social networks. Given that the undocumented experience is often shaped by the local factors, New York's policies on immigrant families can offer insight into how states can help ameliorate the negative impact of an undocumented parent. More broadly, the stakes are high for creating a more empowered and educated immigrant origin youth population, whose future achievements do matter in aiding the competitive advantage of our nation."

Once activated, these receptors rapidly change the internal responsiveness of those cells to incoming sensory inputs and thus alter an organism's perception of the world around it. Determining if steroids work through such mechanisms will help us better understand basic hormone signaling mechanisms as well as the complex neurochemical processes that enable animals, including humans, to adjust their behavioral responses to constantly changing social environments. The experiments will contribute to the training of our nation's future scientists, educators and doctors through the hands-on research experiences that will be provided for students at an exclusively undergraduate institution. Students will participate in projects related to the award through a lab course run by the PI as well as through focused independent research experiences in the PI's lab. The PIs will recruit students from diverse socioeconomic and racial backgrounds to participate in the research. Additionally, the PI will promote STEM education on a Native American reservation in Maine through a neuroscience workshop.<br/><br/>Part 2: Although non-genomic androgen receptor signaling mechanisms have been well-documented in the peripheral tissue of a variety of vertebrates their rapid, central influences have not been thoroughly examined. This project will investigate a novel mechanism through which androgens may rapidly affect social behavior in male goldfish. The goals of this project are to assess whether 1) testosterone rapidly promotes courtship in competitive contexts through androgen receptors; 2) androgen receptors rapidly modulate courtship by influencing responses to pheromones; and 3) androgen receptors affect early olfactory processing and/or functional coupling across brain networks. By characterizing a novel mechanism through which androgens rapidly modulate the processing of social stimuli, new insight into the fundamental neuroendocrine signaling mechanisms that allow animals to rapidly adjust their behavioral responses to constantly changing social environments will be potentially revealed. This project will also have two major types of broader impact. First, it will directly enhance the scientific education of undergraduates at Bowdoin College by integrating the proposed research into an existing neuroscience laboratory course and through independent summer internships and honors projects. Second, the PIs will continue a 4-day workshop in northern Maine for Native American 7th grade students that is built around this project."

Educational researchers have found that calculus presents a significant hurdle for these students. To help counter this, over the past few decades, instructors have become increasingly willing to experiment with innovative teaching formats, such as providing students with instructional videos outside of class to promote a more active and engaging learning environment. Despite this increasing popularity, relatively little is known about how students watch and learn from these instructional videos. To help instructors design videos to better promote student learning of mathematics, this project will collect data about how students use, engage with, and learn from calculus videos. Furthermore, this project will investigate the impact that various ways of structuring the video-watching experience has on student learning. In doing so, this project will generate new knowledge about the effectiveness of various implementation methods for instructional videos in supporting students' productive ways of understanding foundational calculus concepts and real-world applications.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the understanding of how students make sense of and learn calculus from supplementary instructional videos. Project team members will adapt ideas from the fields of information systems and organizational studies to investigate: (1) the ways students interact with video lectures, including how they pause, skip, and re-watch portions of the videos; (2) the aspects of the videos students attend to - and report attending to - as they watch; (3) the ways students make sense of and learn from these videos, and how this relates the other aspects described above; and (4) how various ways of structuring the video-watching experience, such as providing an outline or pre-watching questions, can influence each of these aspects. Data will be obtained from multiple sources, including student responses to mathematical content questions before and after watching videos, timestamps of students' interactions with videos (i.e., playing, pausing, and time-shifting videos), student responses to interview questions as they watch videos, and eye-tracking data collected as students watch videos. The mixed-methods analysis will yield knowledge about the ways students interact with and learn from instructional videos. This investigation into various methods of structuring the video-watching experience will contribute to the field's understanding of how to create and use videos as effective curricular resources and learning tools. In addition, the project will produce research-based guidelines for creating and effectively using instructional calculus videos. By achieving these goals, the research project has the potential to improve the quality of STEM education and, ultimately, contribute to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce."

We may use quantum objects as bits, such as photons, because two possible states of polarization can be measured. However, quantum objects are especially unique because they can be in a superposition of both states, and they can also be entangled in a way such that the measurement of one system affects the other, which cannot be done with non-quantum (classical) bits. So quantum computing systems allow for calculations that cannot be done classically, and it is useful to know of systems that perform computations that classical computers cannot. One particularly interesting quantum state is the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state because of its non-classical properties, and the focus of this project is to do extensive research on this state and its properties. This project will be done in collaboration with Dr. Kae Nemoto, the leading professor in the Quantum Information Sciences research group at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan.<br/><br/>GHZ states are non-biseparable states even for the simplest GHZ state. Therefore, it is useful to study its entanglement in terms of Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication (SLOCC) convertibility to apply those states in quantum information systems.

A key challenge in addressing optimized NoC architecture design today is the plethora of performance enhancing, energy efficient and fault tolerant techniques available to NoC designers and the large design space that must be navigated to simultaneously reduce power, improve reliability, increase performance and maintain QoS. <br/><br/>This research proposes a new cross-layer, cross-cutting methodology spanning circuits, architectures, machine learning algorithms, and applications, aimed at designing energy-efficient, reliable and scalable NoCs. This research will result in (1) novel cross-layer design techniques that take a holistic approach of simultaneously reducing power consumption, while still achieving reliability and performance goals for NoCs, (2) a fundamental understanding of the use of hardware-amenable ML for NoC design optimization, (3) software and hardware techniques for monitoring and collecting critical data and key design parameters during network execution to optimize NoC design, and (4) modeling and simulation tools that will improve the architecture community's design methodologies for evaluating scalable NoCs. The proposed research bridges a very important gap between hardware architects who design power management and fault tolerant techniques at the circuit and architecture level and machine learning scientists who develop predictive and optimization techniques. Due to its cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential to significantly transform the design of next-generation CMPs and System-on-Chips (SoCs) where complex decisions have to be made that affect the power, performance and reliability. The research will also play a major role in education by integrating discovery with teaching and training.

The work will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Christenson, Senior Volcanic Fluids Geochemist at GNS Science, New Zealand.<br/><br/>The chemistry of gases and thermal waters near the surface provides vital information about the state of the volcano and the magma below. However, these hydrothermal systems present specific challenges for volcanology, as surface waters can alter and dilute volcanic fluids and mask seismic signals that may be coming from the movement of magma at depth. There are also inherent dangers associated with volcano-hydrothermal systems, such as phreatic (steam) and phreatomagmatic (steam + magma) eruptions and contamination of fresh surface waters, all of which put local populations at risk. Understanding the structure and behaviour of these systems is critical for interpreting volcanic signals. This in turn enables better eruption forecasting to protect the lives of people living near active volcanoes. This award will support fieldwork to map the hydrothermal system on White Island, the most active volcano in New Zealand, using a method known as electrical self-potential. As thermal fluids flow through the ground, they generate minute electrical currents. By measuring the change in electrical potential along the ground, these currents can be used to effectively map the path and direction of fluid flow. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

An important modern realization is that due to quantum mechanics, the properties of spatially distant electrons in the solid can be inextricably tied together, a phenomenon called entanglement. Quantum mechanical entanglement plays a role in determining macroscopic properties of the solid. A striking and paradigmatic example occurs when the motion of electrons is restricted to two dimensions and is subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field.<br/><br/>The PI will develop new concepts and methods to deal with such electronic states and their identification in experiments.

Specific phases of interest are liquids of composite fermions in quantum Hall systems, quantum spin liquids in insulating magnets, and strongly correlated relatives of topological insulators. There has been a remarkable convergence of these three seemingly different topics in the last two years. The project will develop these connections further and exploit them to further our understanding of each topic. <br/><br/>Specific questions that will be pursued are: i) a microscopic lowest-Landau-level theory of the metallic particle-hole-symmetric half-filled Landau level, ii) a theoretical description of current experiments on quantum spin liquid states, iii) theory and realization of strong correlation effects in topological insulators.<br/><br/>Project (i) is fundamental to the theory of the quantum Hall effect and seeks to provide a microscopic foundation to recent developments on a long-wavelength effective theory for the metallic state in the half-filled Landau level. Project (ii) will seek to develop the theory of quantum spin liquids in contact with many ongoing experiments on Mott insulators that find evidence for various kinds of quantum spin-liquid phases. Project (iii) will study the interplay of strong correlation effects and topological insulator phenomena, two cornerstones of modern work on quantum materials. <br/><br/>In addition to research, the award supports the training of graduate students in modern concepts and methods in condensed-matter physics.

Currently, the climatic impact of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is uncertain due to increasing evidence of their nucleation efficiency, diversity and abundance in the atmosphere. Recently, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from natural wood pulp has been identified as an efficient INP, which may add crucial importance to quantifying the role of primary non-proteinaceous biological INP in the troposphere. However, it is still uncertain if the ice-nucleating activity is specific to MCC structure or generally relevant to all plant structural materials. Answering those questions is the specific aim of the project.

Due to its intrinsic intermittency and variability, VER generation leads to increased uncertainty in the power grid. The uncertainty inherent in VERs must be accommodated by available flexibilities, such as energy storage, demand management, and generators that can offer large rates of increase or reduction of generation. Existing methods for managing uncertainty often passively offer heuristic incentives to these sources of flexibility. However, the available flexibility in the electric power system is limited. As VER penetration increases significantly, system operators often heuristically curtail more renewables, and system security can be jeopardized due to flexibility scarcity. Thus, it becomes crucial to optimize the flexibility demanded by the uncertain sources. The research project will explore an active uncertainty management mechanism in the electricity market with a novel concept, transactive flexibility and uncertainty. Flexibility will be treated like a commodity, which can be bought and sold in the market, to completely address the issue of deficiency in a cost-effective way. Due to its scale and complexity, it is very challenging to solve the associated optimization problem considering the uncertainties from VERs in real-world systems. This project will develop fast scheduling tools to meet the timeliness requirement in real electricity markets. Also, the project results will contribute to development of a new course to be taught by the Principal Investigator.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop a theoretically sound yet practical market clearing model and scheduling tool for power grids with high penetration of semi-dispatchable renewables. Active uncertainty management will position the flexibility optimally, proactively and cost efficiently. Clear and fair incentives will be provided to both uncertainty mitigators and uncertainty sources based on a unified uncertainty marginal price, which varies with location and time. The research project has three cohesive parts: (1) developing a new electricity market model with transactive uncertainty and flexibility satisfying a cost-causation principle; (2) designing novel solution approaches for day-ahead and real-time electricity markets with provable computational performance through exploiting the special structure of the power grid; (3) validating, demonstrating, and promoting the proposed models and computational methods in real-world power systems. The successful completion of this project will potentially address the fundamental challenge of uncertainty management in electric power systems. The systematic framework of the project is expected to increase social welfare, allow for deeper VER penetration, enhance the security and reliability of the power grid, and improve market fairness."

The study investigates refugee hosting in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which is a small Middle Eastern country with 2.7 million refugees in a total population of 9 million people. The challenges of providing shelter, education, health care, and protection to refugees are made difficult  because Jordanian citizens face high unemployment and strained social institutions including overcrowded hospitals and underperforming schools. Refugees and citizens alike are affected by growing national security concerns and the threat of terrorism along the Jordanian-Syrian border. While the study of Western sovereignty is foundational to political sociology and the sociology of international immigration, the literature neglects the sovereignty of developing states that host most of the world's refugees. However, Jordanian sovereignty is indispensable to refugee protection, regional stability, and the global flow of refugees. This project will enhance understanding of developing countries that bear the refugee burden for the rest of the world, exploring how such countries cultivate and maintain their capacity to host large refugee populations while preserving final authority over internal and external affairs of the state. A scholarly focus on the sovereignty-refugee nexus allows for an assessment of the effects that displacement has on refugees and citizens. The project will yield empirically informed insights into interventions that take into consideration the rights of refugees and citizens, the interest of the Jordanian state and Western donor states, and the challenges of aid providing institutions like the United Nations. As an important ally in the region and top recipient of US foreign aid, Jordan?s sovereignty - and the state's capacity to host refugees - is critical to American interests.<br/><br/>How is sovereignty enacted on the ground through interactions among everyday people? Through ethnography and in-depth semi-structured interviews (conducted in Arabic and English), this research incorporates responses from 175 participants, including Syrian refugees, Jordanian citizens, and UN and government officials. This allows the researcher to theorize about how sovereignty is not only a top-down, state-imposed project, but one that is also shaped by the agentic behaviors of citizens and refugees. For example, the social construction of sovereignty from the ground-up includes the ways that border guards practice discretion when deciding who can enter and exit a refugee camp. The analysis of Jordanian sovereignty is situated within a system of sovereign states. The practice of Jordanian sovereignty is necessarily couched within disparities that are foundational to the international refugee regime that distinguishes the Global North from the Global South."

It is a fundamental building block for most large-scale simulations from physics, chemistry, biology, material sciences as engineering.  Open MPI is an open source implementation of the MPI specification, widely used and adopted by the research community as well as industry. The Open MPI library is jointly developed and maintained by a consortium of academic institutions, national labs and industrial partners. It is installed on virtually all large-scale computer systems in the US as well as in the rest of the world. The goal of this project is to enhance and modernize the Open MPI library in the context of the ongoing evolution of modern computer systems, and to ensure its future operability on all upcoming architectures. We aim at implementing fundamental software techniques that can be used in many-core systems to execute MPI-based parallel applications more efficiently, and to tolerate process and memory failures at all scales, from current systems, up to the extreme scales expected before the end of the decade.<br/><br/>Open MPI is an open source implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) specification. The MPI API is currently being extended to consider the needs of application developers in terms of efficiency, productivity and resilience. The project will also support academic involvement in the design, development and evaluation of the Open MPI software, and ensure academic presence in the MPI Forum. The goal of this proposal is to enhance the Open MPI software library, focusing on two aspects: (1) Extend Open MPI to support new features of the MPI specification. Open MPI will continue to support all new features of current and upcoming MPI specifications. The two most significant areas within the context of this proposal are (a) extensions to better support hybrid programming models and (b) support for fault tolerance in MPI applications. To improve support for hybrid programming models, the MPI Forum is currently considering introducing the notion of MPI Endpoints, which could be used by different threads of an MPI rank to instantiate multiple separate communication contexts. The goal within this project is to develop an implementation of endpoints to support effective hybrid programming model, and to extend the concept to other aspects of parallel applications such as File I/O operations. One of the project partners (UTK) leads the current proposal in the MPI Forum to expose failures and ensure the continuation of the execution of MPI applications. In the context of this SSI proposal, the goal is to harden, improve, and expand the support of the existing ULFM implementation in Open MPI and thus enable end-users to design application-specific resilience approaches for future platforms. (2) Enhance the Open MPI core to support new architectures and improve scalability. While Open MPI has demonstrated very good scalability in the past, there is significant work to be done to ensure similarly good performance on future architectures. Specifically, we propose a groundbreaking rework of the startup environment that will improve process launch scalability, increase support for asynchronous progress of operations, enable support for accelerators, and reduce sensitivity to system noise. The project would also enhance the support for File I/O operations as part of the Open MPI package by expanding our work on highly scalable collective I/O operations through delegation and exploring the utilization of burst buffers as temporary storage."

This research will be conducted at the Institute of Environmental Radioactivity (IER), which is hosted at Fukushima University, Fukushima City. Gaining a deeper understanding of the ongoing effects of the disaster is key for the study and development of environmental policies in both the US and Japan. Studies will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Vasyl Ioshchenko, an expert on environmental radiocesium with extensive experience studying radioactivity in the environment surrounding the Chernobyl accident site. As radiocesium can remain in the environment for many years this study will also contribute to the cleanup efforts in Japan.<br/><br/>Data will be developed by sampling soil and vegetation in five different experimental plots within Fukushima prefecture and within the exclusion zone. The plots will represent a range of radiocesium soil concentrations. Three understory plant species will be sampled and the vertical distribution of the roots in the soil profile will be measured within each plot. Soil samples will be collected to determine vertical distribution of bioavailable radiocesium within the root profile of a sampled plant species. Following sequential extraction to separate bioavailable forms of radiocesium, the samples of soil and vegetation will be analyzed for radiocesium content by gamma spectroscopy. The resulting radiocesium concentration and distribution data will be the basis for a mechanistic interpretation of the soil-to-plant transfer factors for the sampled species. Understanding radiocesium behavior in the forest ecosystem is essential for the development of long-term forest management strategy and the clarification of long-term radiation risks. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Increased use of battery powered electric vehicles has reduced smog and decreased gasoline consumption, yet these vehicles remain ill-suited for long distance travel due to lengthy battery recharging times. Fuel cell vehicles also have zero-emissions and decreased fuel consumption, yet require refilling of a fuel tank rather than slow recharging. Replacement of a heavy and bulky battery with a fuel cell decreases the weight and fuel consumption of the vehicle while freeing cargo space. However, commercially available fuel cell designs are cost prohibitive, due in part to high cost platinum catalysts that are necessary to extract electrons from the fuel. Elimination of platinum will significantly reduce cost, and is possible with a solid-state anion exchange membrane, or AEM, fuel cell design. To be commercialized, the chemical and mechanical stability, performance, and processibility of the AEM must be improved. To realize these goals, this project will develop a new platform for molecular design of polymers which impart multiple segments, or ""blocks"", that impart different functionalities that enable optimization for the AEM fuel cell.<br/><br/>The use of triblock terpolymers from polymerized ionic liquids allows simultaneous integration of functionalities that increase stability, ionic conductivity, and processibility. Using this new chemical platform, membrane synthesis will be optimized with the aid of predictive modeling.  Resulting membranes will be fully characterized and then incorporated into fuel cells for testing.  Fuel cell performance will be correlated to membrane morphology to provide a feedback loop to optimize molecular design. The project will train one graduate student and multiple underrepresented undergraduate students. A new portable fuel cell demonstration module will be built to educate K-12 students."

The Whakamaru group erupted intensely and explosively; they evacuated hundreds of cubic kilometers of magma in short episodes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Large eruptions, like the Whakamaru, provide snapshots of the Earth's crust at times when large amounts of magma are present, and their study yields insights into the ability of the crust to generate eruptible magma. Understanding the development and conditions of pre-eruptive magma bodies is paramount to assess hazards and comprehend the magnitude of potential eruptions.

Using erupted natural pumice samples, we can quantify the pre-eruptive magma conditions using crystal-glass thermodynamic equilibrium. Results will make it possible to distinguish particular batches of magma stored at different crustal depths, and also provide insight on the organization and potential interactions between discrete magma bodies. The project also focuses on quantifying the heat flow between the magma body and crust associated with the Whakamaru Group. Phase equilibria modeling will quantify the heat needed within the upper crust to generate and store such quantities of magma, and will assess the conditions of the crust during magma storage. Both conductive and convective heat flow within the crust will be modeled based on the constraints placed by the thermodynamics of crystallizing magma.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

The technical work is informed by, and applied to, online advertising, healthcare, and criminal justice, in collaboration with and as advised by domain experts.<br/><br/>Addressing privacy and fairness in decision systems requires providing formal definitional frameworks and practical system designs. The investigators provide new notions of privacy and fairness that deal with both protected information itself and proxies for it, while handling context-dependent, normative definitions of violations. A fundamental tension they address pits the access given to auditors of a system against the system owners' intellectual property protections and the confidentiality of the personal data used by the system. The investigators decompose such auditing into stages, where the level of access granted to an auditor is increased when potential (but not explainable) violations of privacy or fairness are detected. Workshops and public releases of code and data amplify the investigators' interactions with policy makers and other stakeholders.  Their partnerships with outreach organizations encourage diversity."

In seismology, tomography is most often done using measured travel times of seismic waves to infer the seismic wave velocity structure within the Earth. Another possibility is to use the amplitudes of seismic waves at different frequencies to infer the Earth's attenuation structure, that is, to identify regions where seismic waves lose energy more or less than normal. In this project, the researchers will develop and test a new method to image attenuation structure, with fine spatial resolution, using measured attenuation differences between waves from pairs of nearby earthquakes. The effectiveness of the method will be evaluated on earthquake data from northern Honshu, Japan, and The Geysers geothermal field, California. In the former case, the researchers will endeavor to image three-dimensional attenuation variations deep within the Earth, which will provide insight into the zone where magmas originate that erupt at ""Ring of Fire"" volcanoes and also into the nature of deep earthquakes. In the latter case, the goal is to detect changes in attenuation structure within the geothermal system over time, which can be used to monitor fracturing changes due to geothermal exploitation or stimulation.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new method termed ?double-difference attenuation tomography?, that will be tested on synthetic data, and applied to two regions of interest. The concept is to do for seismic attenuation imaging what double-difference location has done for hypocenter locations and double-difference tomography has done jointly for hypocenter locations and seismic velocity imaging. The key development is event-pair differential t* analysis, which contrasts with previous differential t* analysis methods, which have generally utilized either a phase-pair or a station-pair approach. A spectral ratio approach for nearby event pairs will be used to obtain the event-pair differential t* values, analogous to how waveform cross-correlation is used to obtain differential times for double-difference location and double-difference tomography. This method will be thoroughly tested on both synthetic and real data. Two areas have been selected for applying the new double-difference attenuation tomography method: The Geyser geothermal field, California, and Northern Honshu, Japan. These areas were chosen both for their intrinsic interest and for the availability of results from previous studies to which our results can be compared. This method has the potential for obtaining very high resolution images of seismic attenuation structure in the regions where earthquakes occur. Seismic attenuation is a strong complement to seismic velocity in efforts to distinguish lithology, saturation, fracturing, and temperature in the subsurface, and these factors can affect velocities and attenuation differently. In some of the applications that we envision, high-resolution detection of temporal changes in attenuation is a realizable goal. Many of the possible applications are to problems of high societal importance, such as geothermal energy, mining, wastewater disposal, fracking, CO2 sequestration, and volcanoes. The project will support a female early career scientist and a graduate student."

By using Topic Modeling techniques, big data from the US patent database, and visual analytics techniques, the research will transform the way DbA inspiration is found.  The results will give designers more intuitive, dynamic access and maneuverability for exploring the design space.  Properties of analogical information and external stimuli will be extracted deductively from literature and theory of DbA.

Quantum groups, which are deformations of such symmetries, also serve as a shadow of higher structures. This research project aims to further develop a new approach, via so-called i-quantum groups, to representations of Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras.

In this project the investigator plans to develop the theory of canonical bases and categorical actions of i-quantum groups and their modules in the Kac-Moody setting.

User input via electrical signals from excited muscles, also known as electromyographic (EMG) signals, controls the exoskeleton's actuation, allowing the patient to direct their own movements. The use of pneumatically powered muscles is ideal for this project, as the mechanisms of pneumatic actuators are best adapted for compliance-controlled targets. Just as human muscles exert force under contraction, so do pneumatic muscles. This parallel aids in the current investigation as patients will be using technology that mimics natural movement. As a hands-on endeavor to engage users in their own rehabilitation, the proposed activity stands at the edge of transforming existing parameters for rehabilitative devices and understanding compliant-controlled systems. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by the NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Two species of dogbane leaf beetles (Chrysochus, Chrysomelidae) possess an adaptation allowing them to feed on the toxic dogbane plants (Apocynum, Apocynaceae) in North America. Eight Chrysochus species live in Asia alongside Apocynum, but the nature of their interactions there, and when and how the association in North America evolved, is unknown. This project will investigate the evolution of the association between Chrysochus and Apocynaceae, focusing on the interactions between the widespread C. chinensis and its multiple hosts. Specimens of Chrysochus and their host plants will be collected in China to identify previously unknown host associations and create an evolutionary tree. Feeding experiments will be conducted on C. chinensis to determine whether separate populations eat different hosts, often an early step toward speciation. Experiments will be supervised by Dr. Huai-Jun Xue, associate professor at the Institute of Zoology (IOZ) in Beijing and expert on the evolution of insect-host plant specialization. Situated within the ranges of several Chrysochus species, the IOZ holds the largest collection of the beetles in Asia, making it the ideal location to investigate their evolution.<br/><br/>The award will be used to collect specimens of ten Chrysochus and Platycorynus (a closely related genus) species in five provinces in China. Host plants, other plants in the Apocynaceae, and observations of feeding behavior will be collected in those areas. This work will expand the host association information for the group, and DNA from field-collected and museum specimens will later be sequenced with high-throughput Illumina sequencing to construct the first molecular phylogeny of Chrysochus with complete sampling of species. C. chinensis individuals will be collected in Beijing and fed on several potential host plants in host acceptance and oviposition experiments. Their preference for, and fitness on, the potential hosts will be assessed by proxies such as growth and oviposition rates to determine whether there is evidence for the evolution of host races. This project will contribute to the field of plant-insect interactions, the natural history of an understudied group of organisms, and encourage future cooperation between the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and the IOZ.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Specifically, this research concerns the physics of neutrinos, elementary particles that are produced abundantly in stars and galaxies. These ""astrophysical"" neutrinos have been observed at Earth already and many more observations are expected in the near future. In this context, the theoretical research to be performed by the PI will play an important role in understanding the experimental data and will allow for new insights regarding the fundamental processes that take place in stars and the specific role played by the neutrino properties. In addition, this state-of-the-art research project will provide excellent opportunities for the training of students. <br/><br/>A major area of investigation in particle astrophysics concerns the physics of O(10) MeV neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae that presents a strategic opportunity for upcoming neutrino detectors. It is planned to study the potential of these detectors to measure the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos  from a galactic supernova burst, with minimal theoretical priors, to distinguish different oscillation scenarios. Hours before a star becomes a supernova, neutrinos from the Silicon burning phase might be detectable. The flux of these neutrinos will be modeled in detail, using a new calculation method that includes the nuclear beta processes. Supernova neutrinos can also be detected in the form of diffuse flux from the cosmic population of supernovae. The study of this flux will be revitalized in the light of recent developments, with focus on detectability, and on the potential to measure important physical quantities from the diffuse flux.  At higher energies, E ~ TeV - PeV, extraterrestrial neutrinos were discovered in 2013. This project considers star formation as a possible origin of these neutrinos. Positional coincidences of the neutrino data with known high-star formation regions will be studied quantitatively, and theory models of neutrino production in these regions will be developed.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences."

These fault rocks record deformation that occurred at temperatures and depths that span the seismogenic zone (i.e., where most earthquakes originate). We hypothesize that silica redistribution is a viable process for fault healing on timescales relevant to earthquake (seismic) cycles and therefore can significantly impact the location, frequency, and magnitude of seismic events such as the destructive 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Understanding these healing processes has potential implications for seismic prediction and seismic hazard. Dr. Yoshitaka Hashimoto of Kochi University will serve as source of knowledge for my field areas and will also provide characterization equipment that will allow me to further our understanding of the role of silica redistribution and other geochemical processes that contribute to healing subduction-related fault rocks.<br/><br/>This project will study subduction-related fault fabrics and veins in the Shimanto Belt from multiple mlanges that represent the seismogenic zone in order to assess the role of silica redistribution in healing fault rocks.

The data from the proposed research will help to better constrain a kinetics model for silica redistribution that will assess timescales of subduction zone healing.

This research investigates how laws and policies that govern physician-industry collaboration impact the rate and direction of technological innovation in the medical device industry. Prior work has shown that approximately 20% of medical devices patents could be attributed back to physicians, i.e. expert users providing critical insights to the new product development process. However, physician-industry interactions could also create a conflict of interest if physicians endorse products of companies they collaborate with, which may adversely impact the quality of patient care and elevate the cost of health care. By empirically examining the effect of policy on physician-firm relationships and subsequently on medical innovation, this project aims to provide a more comprehensive yet nuanced understanding of the economic and social implications of user innovation.  The research suggests strategy to help young firms navigate external search for new knowledge to enhance innovation performance.  More broadly, the research suggests policy refinement that could potentially expand the growth of a vital part of the economy.<br/> <br/>This project uses a quasi-experimental design to investigate physician-firm collaboration patterns, as well as the changes in the direction and rate of firms' innovation outcomes. Drawing on a social network perspective, the project further explores how firms may be affected deferentially based on the ex-ante collaboration network patterns of the firms themselves. This research makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the innovation and strategy literature. It extends the user-firm dyadic focus to a broader network context, situates search via users alongside other types of search channels, and examine the dynamics of search patterns. The project provides a novel research design to make significant inroads to establish a causal relationship between collaboration ties and firm innovation. Taken together, this project aims to advance the understanding of the issue of physician-industry collaboration and its multifaceted implications."

This group consists of an estimated 1.6 - 1.7 million young people aged 14-24 who experience homelessness with no parent or guardian each year. This study will generate a detailed understanding of their trajectories into homelessness, their survival strategies, their social networks and relationships, and their connection to - or avoidance of - institutions like schools and shelters. This research will advance scholarship on poverty and urban marginality in three ways. First, it will update the sociological portrait of homelessness, to reflect the disproportionate - and growing - vulnerability of children and youth to becoming unhoused. Second, it will investigate the intimate ties between youth homelessness and several other urban social problems, like incarceration and unemployment, showing how homelessness is an important but overlooked factor implicated in the reproduction of urban poverty. Third, the study will contribute to emerging debates about ""deep"" or ""extreme"" poverty in the American city. Findings from this research will be disseminated to multiple audiences, including sociologists, policy makers, and individuals and organizations who work with and for unaccompanied homeless youth. Unaccompanied homeless youth are often missed by policy interventions that target poor teenagers through families or through neighborhoods. Likewise, adolescents are often excluded from services aimed at homeless families and at homeless adults. They also have different needs, vulnerabilities and experiences. The study will develop a set of detailed policy recommendations about how unaccompanied homeless youth can be more appropriately and effectively served.<br/><br/>This study will be based in New York City, a city in which 1 out of every 8 children enrolled in a public school has experienced homelessness in the past five years. Point-in-time counts estimate that between 2,700 and 7,000 young people are homeless and unaccompanied on any given night. But the transitory, hidden nature of this population means that we know little about their lives. This study has four central research questions. First, what are the events and trajectories that lead to young people becoming homeless and unaccompanied? Second, what does daily survival entail, and do these techniques involve risks or pose barriers to exiting homelessness? Third, how does homelessness affect social relationships, including with family members and with peers, both homeless and non-homeless? Lastly, what are the patterns of institutional engagement and support in the lives of unaccompanied homeless teens? To answer these questions, this research will use mixed qualitative methods to complement existing quantitative research by scholars working in other fields. This research will combine ethnographic fieldwork among unaccompanied homeless youth, with 50 in-depth interviews with the same group, and 25 interviews with adult professionals, including shelter staff, social workers, legal advocates and teachers. This will yield a close and detailed portrait of the trajectories, daily lives, experiences and needs of young people experiencing homelessness alone."

For example, to understand a high dimensional geometric object, one can study the various ways that object fibers (i.e., can be build out of simpler, lower dimensional pieces which are arranged in a predictable way). Even if a complete understanding of the object may be out of reach, one can attempt to comprehend its properties ""on average."" In this project, the PI seeks to apply similar principles to the study of geometrically significant groups via their action on naturally associated spaces. This pursuit brings to bear methods from geometry, topology, dynamics, and group theory, and seeks to not only understand these objects in an abstract sense, but to produce tractable models which allow for quantitative understanding.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will carry out projects that investigate the geometry and topology of hyperbolic bundles as well as  study geometrically motivated counting problems in finitely generated groups. In the classical setting of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, this project builds on a program to study the extent to which the veering triangulation (a certain combinatorial construction) effectively encodes the manifold's geometry and topology. Inspired by the elegant nature of these triangulations, the PI will construct a canonical ideal simplicial complex in the setting of free-by-cyclic groups; a setting where a single topological object controlling the group's algebraic decompositions is currently lacking. Finally, the PI will study the ""typical"" geometry of fibered manifolds, free-by-cyclic groups, and representations of hyperbolic groups. A common thread throughout these investigations will be to demonstrate the extent to which negative curvature features are persistent and, in the appropriate sense, generic."

Magnetic random access memory, which uses magnetism to store information and electricity to read/write information, is a potential candidate as the new generation of memory because magnetism is intrinsically non-volatile and switches fast. The main technical challenge is to reduce the amount of energy it takes to switch the magnetization in the writing process of the magnetic random access memory. This project aims to explore an efficient way to switch the magnetization by using a spin current, i.e. a flow of electron spins, with a specially engineered spin orientation. This work will provide transformative information on how to generate perpendicular spins from magnetic structures, which will significantly lower the power consumption in magnetic random access memories with perpendicular magnetizations. The outcome from this research will lead to a significant advance in data storage and information technologies. <br/><br/>The spin-orbit effects have been demonstrated to be a promising way to convert an electric current into a spin current that can efficiently switch a magnetization. However, thus far the spin currents generated by the spin-orbit effects are constrained by thin film geometries and therefore are only polarized in-plane. It is inefficient to use an in-plane polarized spin current to switch a perpendicular magnetization, which is technically attractive in the application of memories due to their scalability and thermal stability. In this proposal, the investigator plan to explore the generation of a perpendicularly polarized spin current using the spin-orbit effects in ferromagnetic structures, which is based on the hypothesis that the ferromagnetism provides an additional control on the spin orientation. Two complementary structures will be investigated: the spin filtering, where the spin polarization is aligned with the magnetization, and spin rotation, where the spin polarization is rotated about the magnetization. This project leverages on unique expertise in detecting the spin torque on magnetization using the sensitive magneto-optic-Kerr-effect magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance-based magnetometry. The specific tasks in the project are (1) quantifying the efficiency to generate perpendicularly polarized spin current in the two ferromagnetic structures and (2) designing efficient device for switching magnetization with a fast switching time. This study will also provide important insights in the comprehensive spin-orbit effects from magnetic structures."

In addition, sperm storage has been observed in D.temminckii, which uniquely positions this project to address a common criticism of female Bateman gradient studies: namely, that the number of sires is an underestimate of the actual number of mates. By tracking the number of mates progressively during the reproductive season and comparing to the number of sires detected, this study will be the first of its kind with the power to validate (or reject) the use of sires as an estimate of the number of overall mates. Therefore, this project aims to provide insight into the evolution of female sexual selection within a family of fishes that exhibit a derived reproductive strategy; by doing so, we may also resolve the controversy surrounding the use of sires as a proxy for the number of mates and clear the way for future female Bateman gradient studies in surfperch.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by National Science Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

A mechanistic understanding of how the GFP chromophore works in the protein pocket, and why its fluorescence vanishes in solution, remains unclear. This knowledge gap hinders our understanding of important factors which lead to efficient emission. In collaboration with Dr. Justin Hodgkiss, an expert on the newly developed Transient Grating Photoluminescence Spectroscopy (TGPLS), research will be conducted at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. This unique opportunity will allow the study of the broadband fluorescence signal of the GFP chromophore in solution on the intrinsic molecular timescale and will further help to characterize the fluorescent state of the chromophore within the protein.<br/><br/>To design improved fluorescent proteins for high-resolution microscopy, a fundamental understanding of the hydrogen bonding network around a dynamic GFP chromophore is critical. Within the protein, the locked Ser-Tyr-Gly chromophore cannot isomerize and is inevitably forced to release energy through fluorescence. Outside the protein matrix, the interplay between fluorescence and isomerization drops the quantum yield from ~0.8 to ~2x10-4. This striking change of fluorescence indicates that the excited state population of 4-hydroxybenzylidene-1,2-dimethylimidazolinone (HBDI) travels through a conical intersection from S1 to S0, while the rest proceeds through fluorescence. Because of both the spatial and temporal resolution of TGPLS, it is a prime tool to study the time-resolved fluorescence profile of HBDI and gain further insights into the electronic excited state intermediates after photoexcitation. Collaboration with Dr. Hodgkiss will help delineate how fluorescence occurs from a small portion of the HBDI excited state and allow us to better understand the role the protein matrix plays in fluorescence.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

Scientists continue to discover increasing bacterial diversity as molecular methods improve. However, scientists do not understand how this genetic diversity relates to the evolution of new and ecologically important species. Better understanding of the processes that create bacterial diversity is needed, particularly in light of their useful functions in ecosystems. This research will study a group of bacteria, the cyanobacteria, that use light to sequester carbon and produce oxygen. New cyanobacterial species may form when barriers, such as distance or environmental conditions, isolate them and reduce the exchange of genes across populations. That exchange is called ""gene flow"". No one knows if it is distance, or the differences in environment, that prevent gene flow in these important organisms. This project will collect mats of cyanobacteria throughout the Eel River of Northwestern California, and the researchers will investigate the genetic similarity of those mats across different locations. Cyanobacteria will be sampled from distant locations with similar environments and adjacent locations with different environments. The data will be used to determine what is most important in creating cyanobacterial diversity. A local media organization will collaborate on the project. They will help a group of high school students to create a short science documentary film. Students will film the research done in the field and in the lab to gain knowledge about science communication. Their film and the project findings will be used by local schools.<br/><br/>This research will investigate genomic patterns and ecological processes that suggest how spatial and environmental barriers to gene flow differentiate cyanobacterial populations, generating nascent genetic diversity. These barriers are predicted to produce different patterns of nucleotide differentiation at neutral and adaptive loci. Therefore, more understanding of the processes driving biogeographical patterns of microbes can be achieved with analyses of closely related co-existing wild bacterial populations collected over variety of spatial scales. Benthic cyanobacterial mats (Phormidium spp.) and environmental variables will be sampled in the river network in a nested design spanning pairwise distances of centimeters to hundreds of kilometers across diverse habitats, from warm sunny downstream habitats to cool shaded tributaries. Using whole genome metagenomic analyses, patterns of nucleotide variation at loci throughout the genome will be compared and will be used to understand 1) the strength of sub-species population diversity in a widespread cyanobacterial genus, 2) the spatial scales of cyanobacterial population diversity, and 3) the contributions of spatial and environmental barriers to gene flow in driving the observed biogeographical patterns."

The objective of this study is to understand how college, family and community cultures interact to shape the experience of students as they transition to college. What role do students' racial/ethnic and community cultures play as they assimilate into the college and university culture and the middle-class? The methodology includes interviews with approximately 60 college students and observations of eight students, all of whom grew up in the same Mexican-American, working-class community. The interviews and observations will compare students who attend a moderately selective school with students who attend a less selective school. This study advances research surrounding the role that the university plays in reducing inequality. Given the rapid expansion of higher education and its greater accessibility to students from working-class backgrounds, this project examines whether what it means to belong to the middle-class differs across university contexts and the extent to which existing social class hierarchies are reproduced. Moreover, whether student engagement with their communities of origin varies across university selectivity also carries important implications as it relates to policies surrounding academic and student life on college campuses. <br/><br/>Previous research finds that unlike their middle-class peers, working-class college students struggle to reconcile forms of speech, habits and practices associated with both their middle-class and working-class cultures. Previous research, however, has concentrated on the upwardly mobile college experiences of students attending elite or selective universities and, with few exceptions, has not generally assessed how culture rooted in students? racial-ethnic identity contributes to their assimilation into the middle class.  This study draws on Bourdieu and colleagues? concept of habitus to understand how university, family and community culture influence Mexican-origin students' class habitus. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this study takes a comparative assessment of the experiences of students from one working-class community who attended a moderately selective, flagship institution and students from the same community who attended a less competitive, local university. The lead researcher examines the role that race plays in mediating the way in which the university influences students? development of a middle-class habitus as well as whether university culture varies based on school selectivity and/or community contexts. The project pushes theoretical debates to move beyond assumptions that the middle-class culture of the university remains static across school selectivity and community contexts and to consider that understandings of what it means to belong to the middle-class likely vary across social contexts as well. Because this study also examines how university cultures help students build or break ties with their home communities, it carries important policy implications as it relates to how colleges structure academic curriculums and important aspects of campus and student life."

Millimeter-wave (mmW) technology, operating between 30GHz to 300GHz, is a promising emerging solution that offers orders-of-magnitude larger bandwidth than current systems and efficient spectrum usage through beamforming. While recent research shows the tremendous potential of mmW wireless in realizing unprecedented spectral efficiency, Gigabit rates and low latency, it is tempered by significant theoretical and technological challenges. In particular, the hardware complexity of the antennas and mmW circuits, and the computational complexity of digital processing challenge the current paradigms and require a fresh cross-disciplinary approach for addressing tradeoffs in performance, complexity, and energy consumption.  This project is investigating fundamental tradeoffs in the design of wideband mmW wireless networks through an integrated framework spanning communication and signal processing techniques, hardware design, and networking protocols. The four-investigator research team is uniquely qualified to undertake this research due to their complementary expertise. The project is supporting six graduate students, and broadening participation in cutting-edge research to undergraduates and underrepresented groups through curriculum development and outreach efforts. Industrial relationships are informing research, providing opportunities for students, and facilitating technology transfer. <br/><br/>A new cross-domain framework is being developed for integrated design of scalable mmW multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) networks that employ multi-antenna arrays for multi-beam multiuser communication. The research spans communication theory and signal processing, mmW hardware and data converter design, networking protocols, and experimental validation with a state-of-the-art testbed. The research is anchored on four goals: 1) Development of a multi-beam MIMO network architecture and communication/signal processing techniques for mobile access; 2) Investigation of a scalable and reconfigurable slice-based mmW transceiver design for multi-beam MIMO; 3) Investigation of medium access control and higher layer protocols to address mmW propagation challenges and to fully exploit the advanced physical layer capabilities; and 4) Integrated system modeling and assessment for performance-complexity-energy optimization and experimental validation. Several key operational requirements are being investigated, including multi-beam forming and data multiplexing, dynamic beam-frequency allocation and carrier aggregation, dynamic hardware reconfigurability, and flexible networking protocols for diverse use cases. The research results are expected to: i) advance the state-of-the-art of basic theory and design strategies for mmW wireless; ii) act as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary design and analysis of mmW wireless networks, and iii) lead to a deeper fundamental understanding and design methodologies which could impact other applications including imaging, sensing and radar."

Despite this diversity of applications, commercial membranes are currently made of only a handful of polymer chemistries, leaving an opportunity for development of materials that may provide greater selectivity or higher throughput, thereby increasing productivity of the purification. Of particular interest are hydrogel polymers, which unlike conventional polymers, are hydrophilic, and this opens up new applications and may increase performance by decreasing membrane fouling. The aim of this project is to develop a new, scalable method for forming thin hydrogel membranes that can incorporate a broad range of chemistries and functional nanomaterials, enabling greater productivity in purification of water and biomaterials.<br/><br/>This project will develop an approach to form very thin, defect-free hydrophilic selective layers on membranes by free-radical interfacial polymerization. The interfacial tension between an aqueous and organic layer creates a uniform and continuous interface for polymerization. Water-soluble monomers will be polymerized by an initiator with limited aqueous solubility, which will control the thickness of the film. A range of multi-functional materials will be used to control selectivity. Design principles for a robust and scalable process will be established via variation of monomer concentration, chemistry, and polymerization conditions. Embedded functional groups will anchor integrated bio-templated catalytic nanoparticles, which will be for simultaneous deactivation of contaminants. All resulting materials will be characterized and tested for selectivity and catalytic deactivation. The project will impact polymer and membrane science, nanobiotechnology, and catalytically functionalized materials. The new materials will enable efficient water treatment and environmental cleanup.

Equally as intriguing is the recent emergence of a family of atomically-thin ""two-dimensional"" materials. It has grown rapidly to encompass materials with a broad range of technologically relevant properties, at the thickness of one thousandth of a human hair. However, a key component for the nano-nanotechnology tool box, an atomically thin magnet, is lacking. Our goal is to investigate a promising candidate, the magnetic semiconductor CrI3. Employing optical methods sensitive to magnetic properties, we will study its behavior as a function of thickness, from several tens of nanometers down to a single atomic layer. In addition, we will combine atomically-thin CrI3 with existing two-dimensional semiconductors to form atomically-thin heterostructures. This will enable us to explore emerging effects and functionalities occurring at the interface between the two materials. The proposed multidisciplinary research program provides an excellent platform for undergraduate and graduate students to explore new magnetic materials for potential impact in future computing platforms, data storage and consumer electronics.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The isolation of graphene has opened a new frontier in the physical sciences at the limit of a single atomic layer. Since this discovery, many 2D materials including semimetals, semiconductors and superconductors have been realized, but a 2D crystal displaying intrinsic ferromagetism has yet to be reported. Our goal is to investigate a promising candidate, the layered ferromagnetic semiconductor CrI3. Employing magneto-optical spectroscopy (photoluminescence, Raman, and optical Kerr rotation), we seek to understand its fundamental magnetic properties as a function of layer number, including Curie temperature, magnetic ground states, domain dynamics, and the possibility of electrically-tunable magnetism. Using this fundamental knowledge, we will engineer heterostructures formed by monolayer semiconductor WSe2 and ultra-thin CrI3. Spin sensitive optical techniques will enable us to investigate emerging spin/pseudospin phenomena in monolayer WSe2 caused by magnetic proximity effects, and develop new optically-driven spintronic devices such as spin-photovoltaics. In addition to breaking new ground in the experimental investigation of magnetism in the 2D limit, the proposed work may impact future computing platforms, data storage, and consumer electronics by enabling compact, energy efficient devices."

This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Koji Harano and his team at the University of Tokyo, who have for the first time directly observed a single molecule undergoing a particular and important change in shape. The event was captured on video using a powerful microscope equipped with a high speed camera. Understanding the shape, or conformation, changes of molecules is critical to the analysis of complex chemical systems and reactions. This technique produces over 100 gigabytes of data per second of video. Currently, the brute-force method that is used to compile this data into meaningful information requires tremendous computing time and power. Computer vision techniques will vastly increase the speed and accuracy of this analysis and lead more scientific output in this critical area. This project also represents an important exchange of scientific knowledge and techniques between the United States and Japan and will lead to future collaboration on similar projects.<br/><br/>Dr. Harano's team used an advanced imaging technique to observe and measure a molecular -bond rotation for the first time using an aberration corrected high resolution transmission electron microscope equipped with a 1600 fps electron counting direct detection camera. The massive datasets generated by this technique must be processed before meaningful analysis can take place. Presently the technique relies on mathematical cross-correlation algorithms for automatic sorting, classification, and alignment of frames; a task far too cumbersome for manual frame by frame sorting at 1600 fps. However, cross-correlation is somewhat of a brute-force approach and the speed and accuracy of this process can be greatly increased by implementing feature matching computer vision algorithms. This project will implement and evaluate advanced computer vision algorithms for the automatic processing of data generated by Dr. Harano's imaging technique.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

In doing so, the project looks at how grassroots women work against gender inequality through their everyday interventions against VAW.  Focusing on domestic violence, the project will advance our understanding of agency, independent decision-making, and awareness of one's own rights as tools that women use to fight against social conditions that produce gender inequality.  The project will contribute a nuanced theoretical and empirical understanding of how empowerment programs transform the lives of ordinary women into community actors who combat violence against women (VAW).<br/><br/>The project will analyze a diverse set of interviews collected from women using the life history calendar method that helps interviewees recall key events in their lives leading to their transformation and emergence as community leaders.  The respondents will also be asked about building agency in others, imparting agency to survivors, changing community attitudes towards women, and pushing boundaries of gendered norms over time. Specifically, the project will investigate how former participants from various empowerment programs take their leadership training back to their communities and help women survivors of domestic violence achieve justice. As not all participants are trained to intervene against domestic violence, the women often develop independent innovative strategies to navigate the complicated local patriarchal caste and religious structures that support such abuse.  The research will be conducted in Gujarat, a state in India where violence against women remains high, but it is also a region that has a reputation for pioneering women's organizations."

The project will be conducted at Tsinghua University under the mentorship of Dr. Shuxiao Wang, who is a noted expert in air pollution research. China is an ideal location to conduct air pollution research because of its available and abundant resources, as well as its political, scientific, and societal interests in the topic. This project will examine the health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular outcome or premature deaths, of China's new comprehensive air pollution policy, which has resulted in reduced PM2.5 levels. Air pollution is a global environmental issue that is affecting both developed and developing countries, and has local air quality and also global climate impacts. Therefore, even though the research will be conducted in China, it will have impacts on the global community. Because China is one of the major emitters of air pollution, providing quantifiable information on: 1) existing pollution levels, 2) expected improvements in air quality from the new air pollution policy, and 3) estimated health benefits will enhance the global community's general and scientific understanding of this important issue. <br/><br/>There are three input components to be used in the project. The first component, ""Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) output"" , will have estimates of changes in ambient PM2.5 under the action plan. Second, demographic data will be collected from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Lastly, ""concentration-response functions (CRFs)"" for premature death attributable to PM2.5 as well as other disease outcomes of interest will be derived from the epidemiological literature and expert syntheses of literature relevant to China. CRFs will represent the effect of changes in PM2.5 on health outcome incidence of interest. China's current circumstance - highly elevated PM2.5 concentrations, a large number of affected individuals, and rapidly changing pollution control measures - will offer some unique scenarios to investigate under the proposed project.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes Program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Understanding how and why certain individuals show impairments in executive abilities like focusing attention and inhibiting actions is important for researchers in many areas of behavioral and cognitive sciences.  These functions are typically studied by measuring how quickly and accurately an individual can complete different psychological tasks.  However, behavior in such tasks can be affected by multiple processes outside of executive function, making the measurement of individual differences in these functions difficult.  This problem is addressed in the current research using cognitive models.  These models can break down behavior into different psychological components, allowing a deeper understanding of how and why individuals differ in the ability to control their mental processes.  This research will develop and test new models of executive function. These models will provide a new class of tools for investigating cognitive function and how it differs across individuals. The researcher will provide publicly-available statistical packages that allow other researchers to use them in their own studies.  As executive function tasks are widely used across different domains in psychology and neuroscience, these models will broadly affect our understanding of executive control by providing tested tools for analyzing behavioral data.  <br/>	The primary objective of this research is to determine which computational models, existing or to be developed, provide the best theoretical account of processing in executive function tasks.  Competing models will be tested against behavioral and simulated data from a range of executive function tasks meant to measure conflict processing, inhibitory control, and selective attention.  Each task will include targeted manipulations of different cognitive components to provide rigorous tests of the models.  Successful models will then be evaluated in terms of their ability to decompose behavioral data into its constituent cognitive components, especially in real-world situations where limited behavioral data can be collected.  Once the best models have been identified, they will be developed into a statistical package for public distribution.

Despite these occupational and practical affordances, few effective instructional tools exist for the elementary science classroom. Moreover, early elementary school teachers have limited materials at their disposal to promote a rich knowledge of science among the full range of learners. The purpose of this project is to address this need by designing and empirically evaluating a second grade science program, Scientific Explorers, aimed at promoting an early foundation for learning science among all students, including students at risk for or with learning disabilities in reading and mathematics. Scientific Explorers will be designed to improve students' knowledge and understanding of core science concepts. Recognizing the important role of early literacy and mathematics in science learning and teaching, this project will integrate core disciplinary ideas with critical mathematics and literacy standards. To support students as they engage in scientific tasks associated with Earth's Systems, this project will engineer the Scientific Explorers program around a guided inquiry framework. Another aim of this project is to develop and empirically validate a science assessment that measures students' knowledge and application of core science concepts and practices related to Earth's Systems. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Employing a mixed-method approach, this project will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of the Scientific Explorers program. Additional research activities will include establishing the reliability and validity of a second grade science assessment. Approximately 40 second grade classrooms from two different geographical regions will participate in the project. Using multilevel modeling and item response theory techniques, this project will address five primary research questions: (1) To what extent can teachers feasibly implement the Scientific Explorers program in authentic education settings? (2) What is the impact of Scientific Explorers on the science achievement of students in participating classrooms? (3) Do early literacy skills at the beginning of second grade predict differential response to the Scientific Explorers program? (4) Does responsiveness to the Scientific Explorers program differ as a function of reading disability, mathematics disability, or a learning disability in reading and mathematics (comorbid LD)?, and (5) To what extent does the early science achievement measure demonstrate technical adequacy (reliability and validity)?"

One such class of materials found in turbine engines, used in the aerospace and marine industries, are known as superalloys. Superalloys exhibit excellent mechanical properties (strength, creep resistance, corrosion resistance). However, there is a catch in that these materials involve a large degree of structural disorder as a result of the required material manufacturing process. The effects of such disorder become even more pronounced at the high temperatures of turbines, due to sustained loading conditions, leading to microscopic damage and cracks in the material. These cracks are exacerbated over the lifetime of the machinery. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the behavior of these cracks and prevent catastrophic mechanical failure.<br/><br/>Crack initiation and growth in very heterogeneous materials not only can be detrimental but also very unpredictable, thus it requires statistical methods and protocols for assessing the reliability of components at various stages of fatigue loading. This project will advance the science of stochastic crack growth jumps during cyclic loading (fatigue) of metallic heterogeneous materials, with a particular focus on Ni superalloys. The usefulness of the mechanical noise produced by such little cracks is that it might contain distinctive statistical features that can identify the damage level in a turbine component. A team of engineers and scientists will combine multi-scale modeling approaches, statistical methods, and experiments to ultimately develop combined experiment and theory protocols for characterizing the fatigue-induced ""cracking noise"" and assessing the damage levels of mechanical components. Beyond superalloys, the very outcome of this research is to promote the progress of the fundamental understanding of fatigue damage and develop non-invasive structural prognosis methods. An educational outreach program is also  planned that involves graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, as well as the general public, in the under-represented EPSCoR state of West Virginia.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/><br/>This project will advance the understanding of stochastic jumps during fatigue loading of Ni superalloys. A multi-scale modeling approach will be employed that will combine density functional theory (DFT) predictions with phase-field modeling. Machine-learning methods will be incorporated into the phase field model, which will be trained based on conducted experiments. The outcome of this research will be the fundamental understanding of fatigue damage that may be used to predict catastrophic failures, especially when there is limited statistical sampling.<br/><br/>A team of engineers and scientists will develop a novel pathway to predictive modeling of crack growth during fatigue loading in metallic superalloys: By statistically sampling the noise correlations at various stages of fatigue under the assumption of constant-stress short-time tests, we will build a predictive machine-learning framework using a direct multi-step forecasting strategy. In doing so, we will investigate the fundamental origin of stochastic crack growth jumps and will develop a probabilistic model that will incorporate a first-principles relationship of the cohesive energy, generated by density functional theory predictions and phase-field modeling. To validate our models, we will conduct a series of well-controlled experiments using in-situ SEM and we will track crack growth using DC resistance drop measurements. The statistical properties of crack growth noise at various stages as a function of temperature and environmental pressure will be compared to the multi-scale model predictions. The validated multi-scale model will then be used to investigate the probability distributions of crack growth events (classified in terms of crack-length changes) during the first few cycles to predict crack growth at late stages. The outcome will be a trained model that can predict failure based on early fatigue events.<br/><br/>This research project has a societal impact based on the fundamental physical origin of crack growth jumps during fatigue loading of metallic superalloys, which are commonly used on aircraft turbines and other hardware. The aim is to develop general protocols to promote early, safe prediction of crack growth in metallic alloys. In addition to societal impact, an educational outreach program is planned that involve training graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, as well as the general public, in the under-represented EPSCoR state of West Virginia. The focus of training will be on the use of computational modeling materials science as well as the deep understanding of basic physical properties of crack growth, fracture, and non-equilibrium rare events. The PI will design a course that will introduce the fundamentals of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and fracture to multidisciplinary, undergraduate engineering environments."

Despite well-documented ballast-associated introductions of invasive species of various crabs and jellyfish, research exploring the role of ballast in the global transport of microorganisms is limited.

These communication signals are rarely reserved for private conversation, but are inherently social signals involving numerous senders, numerous receivers and complex species interactions. This communication network perspective to animal communication has been slow coming and the majority of studies focus on one-sender-one-receiver exchanges. This is a logistical practicality in many instances, but it has the unfortunate side effect of missing an entire realm of exciting biology. To address this gap, the project tests how mobbing signals, which are acoustic signals used both within and across bird species to communicate about predators, can dictate species interactions in different avian communities and therefore shape communication networks about danger. The project will use playbacks of different species' mobbing calls to experimentally probe how bird species respond to one another. The project is to be conducted with Dr. Toshitaka Suzuki at Kyoto University in Japan. Dr. Suzuki is an up-and-coming researcher in the field of behavioral ecology, who has contributed significantly to understanding how signals can shape complex multi-species interactions. Together, the researchers will begin to understand how species interactions scale-up to communication networks and finally how those communication networks function within different communities.<br/><br/>Communication does not occur in private conversations between one sender and one receiver. Yet the majority of studies of animal communication hold this overly simplistic, dyadic viewpoint. Communication is an inherently social behavior and needs to be addressed as a network with many senders, many receivers and complex species interactions. The project will apply this network perspective to mobbing calls, which are acoustic signals used both within and across bird species to communicate about predators. These mixed-species mobbing events are comprised of complex species interactions that vary by the participation of other species. Therefore, they are an ideal signaling system to explore questions pertaining to how species interact using a communication network framework. The researchers will use playback experiments to test how the avian community assembly influences species interactions in a mobbing call communication network. The project will aid in the understanding of the asymmetrical participation in mobbing communication networks and understand how species interactions may dictate this asymmetry through context-dependent escalation. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Millimeter-wave (mmW) technology, operating between 30GHz to 300GHz, is a promising emerging solution that offers orders-of-magnitude larger bandwidth than current systems and efficient spectrum usage through beamforming. While recent research shows the tremendous potential of mmW wireless in realizing unprecedented spectral efficiency, Gigabit rates and low latency, it is tempered by significant theoretical and technological challenges. In particular, the hardware complexity of the antennas and mmW circuits, and the computational complexity of digital processing challenge the current paradigms and require a fresh cross-disciplinary approach for addressing tradeoffs in performance, complexity, and energy consumption.  This project is investigating fundamental tradeoffs in the design of wideband mmW wireless networks through an integrated framework spanning communication and signal processing techniques, hardware design, and networking protocols. The four-investigator research team is uniquely qualified to undertake this research due to their complementary expertise. The project is supporting six graduate students, and broadening participation in cutting-edge research to undergraduates and underrepresented groups through curriculum development and outreach efforts. Industrial relationships are informing research, providing opportunities for students, and facilitating technology transfer. <br/><br/>A new cross-domain framework is being developed for integrated design of scalable mmW multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) networks that employ multi-antenna arrays for multi-beam multiuser communication. The research spans communication theory and signal processing, mmW hardware and data converter design, networking protocols, and experimental validation with a state-of-the-art testbed. The research is anchored on four goals: 1) Development of a multi-beam MIMO network architecture and communication/signal processing techniques for mobile access; 2) Investigation of a scalable and reconfigurable slice-based mmW transceiver design for multi-beam MIMO; 3) Investigation of medium access control and higher layer protocols to address mmW propagation challenges and to fully exploit the advanced physical layer capabilities; and 4) Integrated system modeling and assessment for performance-complexity-energy optimization and experimental validation. Several key operational requirements are being investigated, including multi-beam forming and data multiplexing, dynamic beam-frequency allocation and carrier aggregation, dynamic hardware reconfigurability, and flexible networking protocols for diverse use cases. The research results are expected to: i) advance the state-of-the-art of basic theory and design strategies for mmW wireless; ii) act as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary design and analysis of mmW wireless networks, and iii) lead to a deeper fundamental understanding and design methodologies which could impact other applications including imaging, sensing and radar."

The implications of this study can be drawn broadly to understand the factors that influence migratory species under rapidly changing environmental and climatic conditions which will be foundational in determining future population dynamics of, often threatened, migratory fishes and will provide information for conservation and management of these threatened populations. Climate variability can influence the nutrients available in freshwater and marine aquatic systems which can subsequently affect the success of migratory organisms to move between those two environments, called diadromy. Additionally, stream flow can be influenced by climatic/environmental variability directly influencing the success of migratory individuals. In this study, we will evaluate how climatic processes, like El Nio, affect stream flow and marine and freshwater nutrient availability to determine if migration success is influenced in two migratory fish species, Gobiomorphus cotidianus and Galaxias argentius. This study will evaluate samples collected from streams representative of varying stream flow and nutrient productivity and will use MODIS satellite images to determine how changes in nutrient availability in the marine environment might influence migration success. <br/><br/>Climate variability can affect the productivity of freshwater and marine systems influencing the success of aquatic migrants between those systems (i.e., diadromy).

To help counter this, over the past few decades, instructors have become increasingly willing to experiment with innovative teaching formats, such as providing students with instructional videos outside of class to promote a more active and engaging learning environment. Despite this increasing popularity, relatively little is known about how students watch and learn from these instructional videos. To help instructors design videos to better promote student learning of mathematics, this project will collect data about how students use, engage with, and learn from calculus videos. Furthermore, this project will investigate the impact that various ways of structuring the video-watching experience has on student learning. In doing so, this project will generate new knowledge about the effectiveness of various implementation methods for instructional videos in supporting students' productive ways of understanding foundational calculus concepts and real-world applications.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the understanding of how students make sense of and learn calculus from supplementary instructional videos. Project team members will adapt ideas from the fields of information systems and organizational studies to investigate: (1) the ways students interact with video lectures, including how they pause, skip, and re-watch portions of the videos; (2) the aspects of the videos students attend to - and report attending to - as they watch; (3) the ways students make sense of and learn from these videos, and how this relates the other aspects described above; and (4) how various ways of structuring the video-watching experience, such as providing an outline or pre-watching questions, can influence each of these aspects. Data will be obtained from multiple sources, including student responses to mathematical content questions before and after watching videos, timestamps of students' interactions with videos (i.e., playing, pausing, and time-shifting videos), student responses to interview questions as they watch videos, and eye-tracking data collected as students watch videos. The mixed-methods analysis will yield knowledge about the ways students interact with and learn from instructional videos. This investigation into various methods of structuring the video-watching experience will contribute to the field's understanding of how to create and use videos as effective curricular resources and learning tools. In addition, the project will produce research-based guidelines for creating and effectively using instructional calculus videos. By achieving these goals, the research project has the potential to improve the quality of STEM education and, ultimately, contribute to the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce."

The programs combine research and career mentorship from researchers at the OTS field sites, along with home mentors from the students' LSAMP institutions, to ensure the integration of the experience into the student's academic career. OTS will enhance the programs by 1) recruiting students from tribal, HBCUs, and other small two-year LSAMP-affiliated institutions where application and participation rates have been lowest, 2) establishing a cultural component to the program through the addition of cultural mentors and other visiting scholars, 3) initiating science communication and outreach training for students in both programs, and 4) providing the opportunity for students to leverage their research accomplishments through travel awards to attend scientific conferences. Finally, OTS will disseminate the students' achievements through the sponsorship of a symposium and the publication of an anthology. These efforts will showcase the rich experiences and successes LSAMP students have shared as well as expand the impact of the program by communicating strategies, successes, and best practices. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of the OTS LSAMP program is to provide hands-on, mentored-research experiences to undergraduate students from groups most underrepresented in the sciences. Specifically, OTS will continue to invite Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanic American, and African American students to participate in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) at the La Selva Research Station in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowland rainforest or the Las Cruces Research Station in southern Costa Rica (students self-select their preferred site). The scientific objectives of the LSAMP REU programs at Las Cruces and La Selva are to: 1) stimulate LSAMP students to pursue careers in biology and the environmental sciences; 2) establish a clear understanding of the scientific method; 3) clarify the importance of biological ecosystems, ecology as a science, and the role of science in conservation; and 4) increase student awareness of the ethical context of research in a local, regional as well as international setting. The Las Cruces and La Selva programs are eight-weeks in length and have evolved to provide LSAMP students with an ideal nurturing environment and scientific community for field research in tropical ecology. Both programs foster daily interactions among students and their researcher mentors. Both empower the students with ownership of their research projects and the confidence to live and work as scientists. In addition, through interactions with Costa Rican researchers, indigenous leaders, and community members, LSAMP students are exposed to different cultural and societal customs and norms as well as international perspectives. Most importantly, these programs require careful assembly of the students' on-campus mentors/faculty advisors who participate in the program and work with the students long after the summer program is over. Frequently, home mentors encourage the students to continue to present their work and even improve upon it during the school year. The active interaction of both research and on-campus mentors on the students' educational and career pathways can be significant and often have been transformational. An alumni survey of the decade-long program conducted in 2015 revealed that, as a direct result of the students' summer experience, 72% of the students gave an oral or poster presentation at a scientific conference, 19% co-authored a paper submitted to a scientific journal, and 13% co-authored a paper that was published in a scientific journal. The survey further documented that 24% had completed a two-year Associate's degree, 67% had completed a four-year a Bachelor's degree, 16% had completed a Master's degree, and 2% had completed a PhD., while two-thirds of alumni were still pursuing degrees in the life sciences or geosciences at the bachelor's level (24%), master's level (24%) or doctoral level (20%). Through the continuation of the OTS program, most-at-risk LSAMP students are receiving the knowledge, skills, confidence, desire, and understanding to build their aspirations into baccalaureate degrees in a STEM field, obtain graduate-level STEM degrees, and/or establish their careers in the biological or environmental sciences."

Ceramic nanofibers have diameters from one to four orders of magnitude smaller than conventional microfibers produced by mechanical drawing. These nanofibers can exhibit unique characteristics such as superplasticity, enhanced machinability, and superior strength and/or toughness that make them attractive for applications in next generation ceramic matrix composites, sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity to various deleterious gases and volatile organic compounds, improved catalysts and catalyst supports, more efficient fuel cells and batteries, and stronger dental composites. However, the technology of nanofiber-based ceramics faces significant challenges in obtaining porous or dense ceramic structures at competitive productivity and cost while preserving the desired properties. This project addresses those challenges through establishing the crucial process-structure-property-performance relationships for selected nanofiber-based ceramic structures, and building the realistic models which can be applied to various nanofibrous ceramic systems to explain and predict the material performance and to advance development of sustainable manufacturing technology and commercial products. Students at different levels (university and high-school) are involved in every aspect of this study and are developing hands-on skills needed for highly specialized jobs in expanding advanced ceramics and associated research and manufacturing domains. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project investigates the roles of initial porosity, structure and ordering of individual oxide ceramic nanofibers during sintering on the resulting microarchitecture and mechanical properties. The key aspects being addressed include: How the nanofibrous state can be preserved during sintering and lead unique and useful properties not otherwise achievable in traditional materials. How structure, porosity, and interaction of nanofibers affect the properties of a fibrous ceramic assemblies. The maximum density that can be achieved while maintaining the nanofibrous structure. Identification of any sintering phenomena associated exclusively with the nanofiber shape. The research activities are carried out with several representative oxide ceramic nanofibers (alumina, silica, zirconia, Mg-Al spinel, and combinations thereof) arranged into 2-D and 3-D nanofibrous constructs. The research is centered on the investigation of (i) effects of the individual fiber behavior and fiber-fiber interaction in the nanofibrous assembly during calcination/sintering; (ii) relationships between the ceramic nanofiber packing, sintering behavior and final structure of nanofiber-based ceramics; (iii) structure /mechanical property relationships in fabricated nanofiber-based constructs, and (iv) building models that are applicable to various nanofibrous ceramic systems to explain and predict material behavior. An advanced high-yield free-surface electrospinning method is employed in this study to produce the ceramic precursor fibers and fibrous assemblies in sizeable quantities with characteristics not achievable by other methods. The project involves two graduate students on the Ph.D. track and provides the research opportunities on a yearly basis to at least three undergraduate students and three local high-school students interested in science."

This project will integrate research and education while developing new theoretical models of the ultra-hot and ultra-dense matter encountered in core-collapse supernovae, proto-neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers. The project will also provide theoretical support for the experimental program at rare-isotope beam facilities. As such, this project will also provide new opportunities to disseminate  exciting forefront research developments in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics to high school students in the Texas Brazos Valley through an integrated lecture and competition series. <br/><br/>A major long-term goal is to understand how the strong nuclear force shapes the structure, evolution, and observable emissions of high-energy astrophysical systems, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers. To support this effort, this project aims to develop the first microscopic models of hot and dense neutron-rich matter based on the low-energy effective field theory of strong interactions. The nuclear thermodynamic equation of state, governing neutron star structure as well as the hydrodynamic evolution of supernovae and neutron star mergers, will be calculated across the range of conditions needed for numerical simulations. This will enable more reliable predictions for the electromagnetic, neutrino, and gravitational wave signals from supernovae and neutron star mergers. The nucleon single-particle potential in nuclear matter will be computed and parametrized in a form suitable for nucleosynthesis studies of neutrino-driven winds in supernovae and the tidally ejected matter in neutron star mergers. Finally, quantum Monte Carlo simulations of dilute neutron matter at finite temperature will be carried out in order to investigate the effect of neutron pairing on transport and cooling phenomena in proto-neutron stars."

This will be accomplished through geoarchaeological evaluation of an intertidal mid-to-late Holocene archaeological site on the Gulf of Maine, USA. This precontact, multi-component site was drowned by late Holocene sea-level rise and it is now buried by 1.0-2.0 meters of salt marsh peat. Because the site was submerged, it exhibits exceptional preservation of unburned faunal remains, multi-component stratigraphy, and organic materials. The main goals are to understand the timing and nature site submergence, map the spatial distribution of cultural materials and natural features, and to continue high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV] analyses of short-term geomorphic processes. An understanding of preservation potential and the influence of local geographic/geological variables will greatly enhance modeling of site survival through sea-level rise. This will generate information relevant to older sites buried farther offshore.  The current project and related future research will provide undergraduate and graduate student training and will generate scientific data ideally suited for public dissemination. Project results will raise awareness of precontact site potential beneath salt marshes, a study area that is frequently overlooked during construction and engineering activities. Project data will benefit Historical Preservation Officers by elucidating the effort required and research potential of intertidal and submerged sites. This in turn should lead to improved regulations regarding environmental impact assessments during wetland remediation or infrastructure improvements. These and other data will demonstrate the need for continuous monitoring and underscore the urgency of identifying archaeological sites threatened by coastal erosion.<br/><br/>In northeastern North America and many other northern hemisphere locations, early- to mid-Holocene coastal sites were submerged through relative sea-level rise and are likely variably preserved due to local geomorphic factors. The investigators seek an understanding of past and on-going geomorphic processes that influence human use of landscapes and long-term preservation potential of submerged and intertidal sites. The researchers will use radiocarbon dating to constrain the age of site components and the timing of sea-level rise. Laboratory techniques will extract and stabilize organic materials unique to waterlogged sites. Traditional archaeological field methods will be augmented by manual core extraction, high-resolution UAV surveys, and intensive spatial data analyses. Site-level inferences will augment geologic models of marine-transgressed landscapes and demonstrate the need for refinement at archaeological scales. UAV mapping is superior to LiDAR and coarse-scale qualitative erosion assessments, and the researchers' innovative use of this technology will generate quantitative data and improve models of short-term (single storm event) erosion and deposition. Though the current project focuses on precontact human and ecosystem responses to sea-level rise and climate change, data generated will help to model the responses of similar systems to future environmental variations."

This prospect has fueled an age-old search for new materials and for techniques to endow existing ones with desirable properties. Traditionally, materials discovery was the result of painstaking exploration of a myriads of chemically synthesized compounds. A new era of materials research was ushered in with the breakthrough isolation of free standing two-dimensional (2D) crystals, such as graphene, and the discovery of a slew of their exceptional physical properties. One of the unique characteristics of these materials is that, with all the atoms residing at the surface, it is possible to access and manipulate their properties by non-chemical means. In particular the introduction of strain by stretching or bending the 2D membrane, can play a crucial role in shaping the material and electronic properties. This research is aimed at developing strategies to induce, to characterize and to exploit the extraordinary potential of strain as a handle for manipulating and engineering electronic and material properties. By modifying the distance between atoms and the geometry of the crystal structure, strain can transform the material properties and has the potential to radically change its behavior. The development of methods to introduce strain in a controlled matter will make it possible to systematically investigate novel strain-induced material properties and unleash their potential for device applications. The research project has a strong educational component that provides excellent opportunities for students and trainees at all levels to gain hands-on experience with advanced scientific equipment and to develop sophisticated data analysis skills. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>One of the remarkable qualities of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is the possibility to use external strain to manipulate in a controlled manner their electronic properties. These materials are highly stretchable, have large Young's modulus, low residual stress and enormously large breaking strength which enables them to sustain very large strains without breaking. This research aims at developing techniques to induce, characterize and exploit the extraordinary potential of strain as a handle for manipulating and engineering electronic properties. Introduction of strain by stretching or bending a 2D membrane, makes it possible to change and control the lattice spacing and crystal structure and can play a crucial role in shaping the band structure and the electron dynamics. The team investigates novel properties expected to arise in the presence of strain, such as opening or closing spectral gaps, strain induced superconductivity and topologically protected transport properties by controlling the strength and geometry of the induced strain. Local probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy and Landau level spectroscopy as well as global transport measurements are used to characterize the strain-induced electronic properties. The materials studied include graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and group IV monochalcogenides, where the effects of strain on the band structure and electron dynamics are expected to be most pronounced."

The appropriation of state lands for commercial agriculture and the associated dispossession of rural occupants constitute a widespread phenomenon that goes back centuries. But social scientific research on ""land grabs"" in the more interconnected world of today is just beginning. The researcher asks, How are state and public lands defined and delimited today? Who can use them and for what purposes? How are local people responding? And what does all this tell us about the nature of contemporary forms of governance and citizenship? To answer these questions, the researcher has identified a region where these processes are active and can be examined as they develop. By investigating a case of political and cultural disputes over land closely, this research will provide a unique window into emergent state transformation and changing definitions of private and public in the contemporary world. <br/><br/>The research will be undertaken by Julio Arias Vanegas, a City University of New York anthropology doctoral student who is supervised by Dr. Marc Edelman. The active site that Arias has identified for this project is the Altillanura region of post-conflict Colombia. Arias will conduct twelve months of fieldwork in different locations in Colombia, collecting data through multiple methods, including document analysis, oral history, interviews, and participant observation. He will focus on two dissimilar but interrelated cases: (a) the case of state property that was home to an important regional agricultural research center and over which various groups now claim rights; and (b) an emerging regionalist agrarian movement that has confronted state legislation over the designation of specific land holdings as baldos (vacant public lands). The study of these cases will allow the researcher to examine: how conceptions of regional people, nature, and territory, as well as public and private properties, have changed through legal and scientific debates; how racial and regional identification and belonging are deployed; and how different land-holders and occupants challenge and reshape state projects through their own notions and forms of land tenure. In doing so, this study will shed light on the making of the relationship between state formation, property conflicts, and the production of frontier regions. The research will contribute to social scientific theory on the state, regionalism, and dispossession. Findings also will be relevant for policymakers interested in land distribution and its political and cultural consequences, particularly in transitional contexts."

The goal is to design sparse strategies which stabilize models of metabolic networks away from undesirable equilibria with an eye to developing algorithms which could one day be used to design drugs regulating human metabolism.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>The design of efficient algorithms which find the sparsest possible controllers for linear and polynomial dynamical systems will be investigated. Whenever this is not possible intractability results rigorously demonstrating this impossibility will be developed. A central focus of the work will be on computational complexity issues as the search for sparse controllers turns out to be intractable in many cases of interest. The main contribution will be in the development of algorithms which take advantage of the generic properties of real-world systems to avoid intractability barriers and efficiently find very sparse controllers.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The algorithms have potential to become standard tools of control engineering practice whenever large systems are involved or when the number of sensors and actuators available is limited. The PI will work to ensure that the protocols developed here enter into the control curriculum. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the execution of the research. Outreach activities are planned, especially for beginning undergraduate students with the aim of increasing retention rates of under-represented groups in engineering."

Recent Middle East-North African history provides exceptional cases to test and enrich related theories. Beginning late 2010, the Arab Spring concatenation of mass movements challenged regimes? right to rule, police states, and economic-development orientations. By early 2011, many saw these uprisings as initiating democracy and social justice across MENA. Yet, uprisings emerged in only six MENA countries; others had reformist or few protests; and later outcomes contradicted demands. Consider the political despair, the imprisoned or dead, the masses made refugees, compared to popular calls for socioeconomic wellbeing or democratic empowerment. Of the six uprisings, four ousted long-standing rulers (Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Libya) and two were deflected (Bahrain, Syria). Tunisia alone would then transition to political democracy; Egypt's military and Bahrain's monarchy institutionalized autocratic counterrevolutions; and Yemen, Libya, and Syria descended into internationalized civil wars. This project seeks to explain these three interrelated outcomes: namely, why uprisings emerged in some regional countries and not others (revolution emergence); why some uprisings ousted rulers and others did not (initial political outcomes); and lastly, why cases produced political democracy, counterrevolution, or civil war (major political outcomes). This project addresses theoretical debates on the oppositional movements, political and economic regimes, and global relations impacting revolutions. The project analyzes the contingent dynamics of social, state, and global actors contending to transform or retain autocracy and neoliberalism, and the institutional-structural terrains conditioning these struggles and outcomes. By splitting cases into multiple episodes and outcomes, not single isolated-linear processes, this project enhances knowledge of successful/positive, failed/negative, and reversed cases amid revolutionary waves. <br/><br/>This project uses comparative historical-sociological methods for in-depth case studies and comparisons, and multi-level, combinatorial, and interactive causal analysis. First, the project uses fuzzy-set/Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 21 MENA countries to locate causal combinations for revolution emergence, no emergence, and reformist protest. Fuzzy sets allow fine gradations in degrees of set membership in potential causal factors, rather than neatly-defined fixed sets, which enables evaluating complex causation. This project creates composite indexes to determine countries' set membership scores in oppositional mobilizing structures, sultanistic-autocratic regimes, rentier states, uneven development, and neoliberal globalization, with fs/QCA locating necessary and/or sufficient combinations of these factors for the specified outcomes. These combinations are analyzed vis--vis case interaction/revolutionary diffusion. Second, this project uses within- and cross-case analysis for three full and three mini case studies. Case analysis prioritizes the impact of movement composition and action-forms, state-military structures, and global relations on the initial and major political outcomes. Dense event timelines are created using event-level data from organizational reports and systematically-gathered newspaper data, generating analytical sketches of actors' activities and interests, protest events and cycles, and institutional changes. Semi-structured in-depth interviews of movement organizers further ground this project. By processually studying positive, negative, and reversed cases, this project will explain why many Arab Spring cases defy existing revolution theories and inform movement activists and political leaders on the nature, durability, and change of autocratic regimes and exploitative economic systems."

Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to eradicate cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue as much as possible. However, if unaccounted for, internal organ motion during radiation delivery may lead to underdosing of cancer cells or overdosing of normal tissue. Organ motion is of particular concern in the treatment of lung and abdominal cancers, where breathing induces large tumor displacement and organ deformation. A recent technological innovation is a new generation of radiotherapy systems equipped with on-board magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners providing a real-time high-contrast movie of the patient's anatomy during radiation delivery. This research will develop the methods to enable use of real-time imaging to control the progress of radiation delivery in order to correct for any dose discrepancy, thus allowing treatment plans to actively adjust to anatomical changes.  If successful, the research will provide clinicians with real-time organ-motion management tools that have the potential to improve the delivery efficiency and radiation dose conformity for MRI-guided radiotherapy, leading to higher rates of disease control and fewer side effects for cancer patients, thus improving their quality of life after treatment.  The project will provide support for a graduate student who will benefit from the multi-disciplinary research environment.<br/><br/>This research employs medical-image processing techniques to infer the time-dependent state of the patient's anatomy from the stream of MRI sequences and to estimate the cumulative delivered dose in real-time. Using the inferred anatomical information, a stochastic model will be developed to project the immediate future trajectory of the anatomical motion. The cumulative dose estimation and the projected anatomical trajectory will be integrated as feedback and feed-forward control signals, respectively, into a stochastic control problem, which will be solved dynamically to (re)optimize the radiotherapy plan over the remainder of the treatment session. The control approach will be tested on clinical cancer patients previously treated with MRI-guided radiotherapy at a collaborating cancer center to quantify the anticipated improvement in plan quality and delivery efficiency. The project also provides a foundation from which to quantify the value of real-time MRI information."

An integral part of preparing biology students for modern STEM jobs is ensuring that students receive instruction not only in biology concepts, but also in the skills used by practicing biologists. Such skills include scientific communication, collaboration, quantitative reasoning, and problem solving. The fundamental objective of this work is to produce tools that will facilitate the improvement of undergraduate biology skills training. This project will produce two tools - the BioSkills Guide and the Programmatic Survey of BioSkills Coverage - designed to be used separately by instructors as they review and enhance their teaching or together to help departments through the process of curricular reform. The BioSkills Guide will translate general recommendations about skills training into concrete descriptions of tasks that can be taught in the classroom, clarifying what it means for a student to be competent in each skill. The programmatic survey will reveal which skills are already well covered in a department's curriculum, which are lacking, and in which particular courses each skill is taught. Administrators can use data from this survey to make decisions about where to target reform efforts and resources, and the BioSkills Guide can support individual course or curriculum-wide redesign. The tools produced by this project are intended to support educators nationwide as they train biology students in the skills they need to be successful in the modern U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The AAAS report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, published in 2011, identified six essential skills, termed core competencies, around which college biology curricula should be built. This project will elaborate the Vision and Change core competencies by developing tools that will support individual and department-wide efforts to improve core competencies teaching. Specifically, the proposed project will develop two tools: the BioSkills Guide and the Programmatic Survey of BioSkills Coverage. The BioSkills Guide will be a set of learning goals with examples of supporting activities, elucidating each of the six core competencies. The guide will be collaboratively drafted and iteratively revised, incorporating the combined expertise of educators at a variety of 2- and 4- year institutions. The final product will then be validated using a survey sent to hundreds of biology educators and practitioners nationwide. To extend the value of the guide, each learning goal in the final guide will be mapped to evidence-based instructional practices and validated assessments from the literature. By translating core competencies into specific learning goals that can be observed and assessed, the BioSkills Guide will define what it means for an undergraduate biology student to master those skills. By reaching a consensus among biology educators who teach at diverse institution types, across a range of subdisciplines and course levels, the guide will delineate which learning goals are most important for biology majors. Alignment of BioSkills learning goals with existing assessments will enable biology education researchers to prioritize development of novel assessments addressing competency learning goals that lack appropriate testing instruments. The validated BioSkills Guide will be adapted into a Programmatic Survey of BioSkills Coverage, offering departments a means to obtain a more fine-grained assessment of competencies coverage than existing tools. This survey will enable biology departments to internally review curriculum-wide coverage of competency learning goals. To ensure the survey has widespread applicability, it will be iteratively revised following instructor interviews and pilot implementations at multiple institutions.  Together these tools can be used to bring department practices into alignment with national standards outlined in Vision and Change."

The objective of this Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering site, Research to Inspire Students in Engineering through commUnity Partnerships (RISE UP), at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is to create partnerships between UNH, local school systems, and industry (specifically the manufacturing sector) to improve student learning through teacher development/research training and academic year follow-up activities. Participants will be provided the opportunity to engage industrial-based research projects, within a broad theme of micro-scale phenomena, mathematical modeling, and material behavior. The RET program will target rural and urban schools, with an aim to attract underrepresented groups, including first-generation college students. The overall goal is to effectively incorporate activities that integrate science and engineering practices into pre-college curricula and thus attract and motivate young people to engineering disciplines. In addition, the inclusion of rural and urban schools and women faculty as mentors has the potential to attract underrepresented individuals to engineering, including first generation college students.  <br/><br/>Each summer over the three-year grant period, the RISE UP Site will host a cohort of 12 pre- and in-service secondary STEM teachers and  community college faculty in a 7-week  experience (including orientation, intensive research, curriculum development, field trips to local companies, and academic year follow-up which includes visits to classrooms by graduate student, faculty and industrial mentors). The teachers will be active participants within their selected research groups and conduct research projects guided by the graduate students, faculty, and industrial mentors.  The intellectual merit of RISE UP lies in implementing authentic research to develop engineering practices in classrooms, and assessing the impact on teachers.  How teacher immersion in research projects translates into more effective teaching; content understanding and motivation for teachers; and increased student learning and interest in pursuing engineering careers will be evaluated. The effect of the industrial focus and participation in the project will also be assessed. The UNH faculty and graduate students will experience the teachers' perspectives in designing activities that engage a variety of student learners. The project will bring together a sustainable community of partners to collaborate on developing and implementing authentic science and engineering practices in classrooms that can generate a broader impact across the nation."

These same signals also regulate the behavior of fully functional cells in adult tissues.  Defects in cell signaling are the cause of many birth defects and can also cause cancer cells to form.  Although great strides have been made in understanding the molecular basis of cell signaling, most of this work has been conducted in cells that are not dividing.  The effect of cell division on cell response to signals remains poorly understood.  This project will help fill this crucial gap by examining the interplay between cell division and signaling.  The proposed experiments will examine how proteins that receive signals from neighboring cells are moved around inside dividing cells.  Because both cancer cells and embryonic cells frequently divide, the distribution of these signal-receiver proteins during cell division is likely to play a crucial role in creating embryonic cell identity and in promoting cancerous cell behaviors. This proposal will also promote intensive training of diverse undergraduate researchers in designing and carrying out independent research projects.  The project will also promote public education through interactions with many well-established outreach programs in the Philadelphia area.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph:<br/><br/>Cell fate induction is affected by trafficking of signal components.  Recent studies have overturned the long-held assumption that membrane trafficking is shut down during mitosis.  Thus, mitotic trafficking of signaling components may play a profound, largely unrecognized role in cell fate specification.  The long-term goal of the PI is to understand how cell division affects inductive signal processing.  This question is addressed by examining heart progenitor induction in the basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis.  The PI has exploited the extreme cellular simplicity of Ciona embryos to perform high-resolution, in vivo analysis of inductive signaling mechanisms, and focuses on Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)-dependent induction of the heart progenitor lineage.  Mitotic redistribution of FGF receptors (FGFRs) was found to promote differential heart progenitor induction.  The PI hypothesizes that mitotic kinases regulate trafficking of FGFR-enriched adherent domains, and will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Characterization of mitotic trafficking of FGFR-enriched signaling domains through image analysis of tagged proteins in live, intact embryos; 2) Delineation of the role of specific endocytic pathways in signaling domain redistribution through co-localization analysis using pathway-specific markers and targeted disruption of pathway-specific components;  3) Determination of how mitotic kinases affect endocytic trafficking of FGFR-enriched domains through targeted disruption of kinase activity.  Completion of the proposed studies will provide fundamental insights regarding the interplay between division and signaling in both embryonic and stem cells."

The award to Norfolk State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project will focus on constructing a mathematical model to investigate the role of social behavior in the transmission dynamics of HIV epidemics.  The outcomes of this work can inform public health officials when analyzing and determining the impact of social behavior in the transmission of HIV epidemics. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Norfolk State University.<br/><br/>This project will focus on developing mathematical models, in the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the role of risky behavior on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  Studies have established a strong correlation between risky behavior and the acquisition of HIV infection.  Some of these behaviors are associated with substance abuse. Although it is understood that there are different degrees or stages of substance abuse, the impact of such heterogeneity on the overall disease transmission process has not been rigorously studied.  This project will investigate these dynamics and their role in the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  To achieve this objective, new realistic mathematical models, which incorporate the essential features of HIV disease as well as the dynamics of relevant risky behaviors, will be developed.  These models, which will be rigorously analyzed using techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems, such as asymptotic stability and bifurcation theory, to gain insights into their dynamical features, will be parametrized using available relevant public health and demographic data. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, using suitable sampling techniques such as Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients, will be carried out on the parameters of the models to assess the impact of uncertainty in the estimates of the parameter values used in the simulations on the overall simulation results obtained, and determine the most important parameters that drive the disease transmission process."

A long-standing hypothesis is that evolutionary change in flower form can be driven by shifting interactions between floral MADS-box transcription factors that go on to affect downstream gene regulation. This project will test this hypothesis using an experimental system developed by the PI, where MADS-box protein-protein interactions can be precisely manipulated to study how they impact downstream gene expression and floral development. In Aim 1, the impact of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization on floral development will be explored using gene editing technology, microscopy, and geometric morphometrics. In an allied education aim, high school interns will assist with genotyping plant lines, and explore the people behind the science in a 'Heroes of Biology' journal club. In Aim 2, the genome-wide gene expression profiles downstream of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization will be determined using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. In an allied education aim, undergraduates in the lab will design and perform qRT-PCR experiments to validate next-generation sequencing results. In Aim 3, the protein-protein interaction profiles of MADS-box dimer variants will be determined both in vitro and in planta. Sophomores in the PI's research-based molecular evolution class will test select MADS-box protein-protein interactions. This project will contribute to the understanding of regulatory evolution, to the understanding of floral diversity, and to the understanding of floral development. The mechanistic understanding of grass flower development gained through this work, including in a major crop plant (maize), may facilitate the precise manipulation of floral development for enhanced plant productivity."

It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides ""high throughput computing"": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC ""brand"" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.<br/><br/>Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's ""Account Manager"" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of ""keywords"" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination). Finally, Science United will provide web interfaces letting volunteers see their contribution status and history, and letting administrators add projects, control allocations, and view accounting data."

To address this demand, Columbus State Community College (CSCC) will collaborate with universities, high schools, and regional employers to educate next-generation technicians to work in logistics industries. The project will expand CSCC's associate degree program in Logistics Engineering Technology (LET) to add a work study component with paid industrial learning experiences for students. New laboratory demonstrations will be developed and implemented in the curriculum to strengthen students' experience with the type of state-of-the art equipment used in the Central Ohio logistics industry. Thus, students will combine knowledge from classroom demonstrations with worksite applications so that they can move seamlessly into real work environments. The project will create a process for adult learners, particularly under-employed existing workers or military veterans, to formally recognize and apply previous training or experience toward the associate degree. Specific outreach to underserved and underrepresented groups will ensure that a diverse set of students are recruited and retained in the program. Summer programs will also be conducted to engage high school students in logistics technologies. This project will help build a diverse technician workforce in logistics engineering and strengthen this important high-growth sector of the nation's economy.<br/><br/>The LET curriculum will combine technology applications (e.g. programming, data mining, and simulation modeling) with engineering systems (e.g. automation systems, controls, stochastic processes, computer-aided design, electro-mechanical and industrial engineering), with supply chain principles. The intellectual merit contributions of the project will be creation of educational pathways that add: 1) A paid real-world experiential learning component that leverages a proven work study model and adapts it to the growing regional logistics industry. During students' second academic year in the program, they will take classes two days per week and learn on-the-job the remaining three days. 2) An innovative laboratory with an automated work cell to simulate a smart conveyer used in regional companies. The system will contain a flat belt conveyor and chip belt conveyer controlled by a mechanical drive learning system to give students experience installing, operating, and maintaining the technologies used in industry. 3) A bridge program to address the needs of adult learners, especially the unemployed, under-employed incumbent worker, and military veterans, and that includes assessments of prior learning, a formalized process to recognize past training, and learning modules to help reintegrate these learners into higher education. A Work-Study Summer Institute for high school seniors will also be created, in which participants earn a stipend during an intensive one-week introduction to logistics engineering technology. The project outcomes will be extensively evaluated and disseminated to a national audience for replication."

More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured, there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood, and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins, ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique. This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate. Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time, supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

Layer by layer over hundreds of thousands of years, snow has precipitated on the ice sheet, become compacted, and turned into additional ice. Any dust or other impurities in the air or snow have been precipitated as well and thus each snowfall leaves a snapshot record of the atmosphere that existed at or near the time of deposition. A detailed chronology of volcanic eruptions can be obtained from the ice layers where ash and other volcanic products were deposited. Normally, the analysis of volcanic layers requires the physical extraction of a core from the ice sheet; however, chronologies from cores have discontinuities and are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to obtain. <br/>Borehole logging is a measurement method where one lowers instrumentation into a drilled hole in the ice, whether or not core has been retrieved. To date, this technology has only been used to measure optical systems to identify volcanic ash and other impurity layers. In this program, a profiling technology will be developed that measures the conductivity of the ice. A radio-frequency emitter lowered into the borehole will create a return signal that changes depending on the local conductivity, which depends on the concentration of dissolved ions. For example, dissolved sulfates are a critical marker of volcanic activity that may not be coincident with deposited ash. Other dissolved ions, such as chloride, can be indicative of other processes. It is expected that this borehole profiling instrument will be able to help rapidly identify volcanic eruptions that had potentially global impact, distinguish between different dissolved ions via their frequency dependencies, and assist in establishing chronologies between different ice cores and boreholes.<br/><br/><br/>Part II: Technical Description<br/>Borehole logging of the Polar ice sheets is one of the most important methods that earth scientists have to identify and date volcanic eruptions.

This program will investigate and demonstrate a borehole logging-compatible radio-frequency dielectric sensor to detect and measure spikes in dissolved major ions chemistry in ice, particularly in intervals corresponding to volcanically produced sulfates. The sulfate layers are one of the primary signatures of volcanic products. However, other ions, such as chlorides, calcium, and others are also commonly seen in ice, and the dielectric logging technology of this program would also measure these.

This project aims to understand how jawed vertebrates evolved from jawless fish.  This will be done by comparing the development of the modern jawless fish, lamprey, with that of two jawed vertebrates, the african clawed frog, and the zebrafish.  To do this, modern methods for manipulating gene function will be used to alter the activity of genes involved in head skeleton development.  These manipulations are aimed at partially recapitulating the evolutionary process and pinpointing which genes were most important for jaw evolution. The work will shed light on a major evolutionary event that made possible the evolution of the majority of vertebrates now living on the planet, including humans.  The project will also help elucidate how the head skeleton and jaw develops in all vertebrates and contribute to efforts to understand the developmental and genetic basis of diseases effecting the face, skull, and jaw. Additionally, the project will provide training in modern genome engineering methods for a postdoctoral scholar, two graduate students, and several undergraduate and high school students. It will also support the maintenance of a traveling museum exhibit about animal development and evolution, and accompanying public lectures by the lead investigator.<br/><br/>The morphology of early vertebrate fossils, and basally-diverging modern vertebrates, suggests that jaw evolution involved two major changes in head skeleton structure; the evolution of morphologically distinct dorsal and ventral skeletal elements, and the positioning of flexible joint tissue between these elements.  How, mechanistically, these changes occurred, is unclear.  In gnathostomes, head skeleton precursors are segregated early in development into dorsal, ventral, and intermediate domains by interactions between Jagged-Notch, BMP, and Endothelin (Edn) signaling pathways.  These signals regulate the combinatorial expression of Dlx, Msx, and Hand transcription factors which, in turn, activate the morphogenetic and differentiation programs that shape skeletal elements and specify joints.  To better understand the developmental changes underlying gnathostome head skeleton evolution, this research will utilize the living agnathan, lamprey.  Lamprey is the only extant jawless vertebrate amenable to routine embryonic manipulations. Initial gene expression studies suggested that lamprey lacks dorso-ventral restricted expression of Dlx paralogs in head skeleton precursors. Subsequent work revealed unexpectedly gnathostome-like expression of Edn signaling components, Dlx, Msx, and Hand in the forming lamprey head. Furthermore, it was found that a lamprey homolog of the joint tissue specifier, Gdf5, is expressed in mucocartilage, a soft, mesenchymal skeletal tissue histologically similar to gnathostome joint tissue.  These data supported a model in which; 1) a sophisticated gnathostome-type head skeleton patterning system predates the evolution of jaws and 2) the evolution of joints was driven by the repositioning of ancient gene programs for soft skeletal tissue differentiation within this conserved pre-pattern. The proposed work will take advantage of recent optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in lamprey to test key predictions of this model in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, and the frog Xenopus laevis."

This unit will not include a pressure vessel or other borehole logger packing. We will test different means of applying electrical signals including short pulses and periodic waves. We will further utilize differential measurements with low noise circuits and filters to achieve maximum sensitivity. We will correlate the signals extracted with known molarities of sulfates and other ions and measured ECM records. We will perform scaled-down experiments using real ice cores stored in Bay?s lab at UC Berkeley.  This will permit testing of different designs in ice with natural impurities and polycrystalline structure. This small collection includes cores from a variety of locations in Antarctica and Greenland, and a variety of ages as old as a million years."

Between fears that gene patents hinder scientific progress, concerns that patent trolls are a threat to innovation in IT and software, claims that drug patents contribute to high prices of pharmaceuticals, and the counter-arguments that patents are essential for innovation, patent policy has emerged as one of the most controversial aspects of science and technology policy. Patent policy design is difficult: it requires balancing incentives for innovation with benefits from broad access to new technology, two goals that are often at tension with one another. Concerns that the U.S. may not have this balance right have lead to numerous proposals for patent system reform over the past decade. <br/><br/>There is now a considerable body of empirical evidence on the effects of patents. This research report provides a systematic survey of empirical work on patent policy, summarizing the evidence on five main questions central to patent policy-making: (1) How important are patents for innovation? (2) Do patents create incentives for disclosure of information that would otherwise be kept secret? (3) How large are the costs associated with restricted output and higher prices? (4) Do patents hinder follow-on research in contexts where innovation is cumulative? (5) Does the patent system support markets for technology? The report discusses the strengths and limits of different approaches, distills what we have learned about the effects of patents and implications for policy, notes key uncertainties, and indicates where more research is needed. Finally, it summarizes evidence on the effects of major patent policy changes over the past fifty years, including the expansion of patent eligible subject matter, the growth of patenting on publicly funded research, special patent law procedures for pharmaceuticals, and the globalization of patent protection."

Harsh environments such as cold weather or inadequate food can cause animals to slow their growth or even pause growth altogether.  Despite this severe interruption to their development, if the environment improves, animals will continue their growth and ultimately become normal adults.  The genes and proteins that allow animals to develop normally after a long interruption are unknown and are a major knowledge gap.  This project builds on previous work from the PI to study this question in the microscopic nematode C. elegans.  These worms are a valuable model because of their simplicity and ease of use for experiments.  Furthermore, C. elegans shares 7,663 genes with humans, meaning that what we learn from C. elegans is often relevant across species.  As part of this study, a new program will engage student teachers in research.  This program will foster teacher-leaders who will then provide effective STEM education at the K-12 level.  This education is critical for the US to maintain its leadership in scientific disciplines, and to provide students with skills that employers value.  Furthermore, this study will result in the training of many undergraduate and graduate students, both in the PI's research lab and in lab-based courses taught by the PI.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The proposed work capitalizes on the power of C. elegans as a model to elucidate mechanisms that enable development to occur normally after diapause.  In favorable environments, C. elegans develops continuously through four larval stages separated by molts.  In contrast, adverse environments promote entry into diapause (""dauer"") midway through larval development.  Despite this interruption, if favorable conditions are again encountered, development proceeds normally due to the modulation of developmental pathways and re-setting of cell fate.  Prior work from the PI indicates that the potentiation of microRNA activity is a key component of the post-dauer developmental program.  This project builds on that work to discover and characterize factors involved in post-dauer microRNA pathways.  Preliminary data suggest that two transcription factors, ZTF-16 and FOXO/DAF-16, are important players in the post-dauer pathway. Genetic and molecular experiments will test the hypotheses that ZTF-16 is a microRNA target and that FOXO/DAF-16 is a modulator of microRNA activity.  In addition, genomic approaches will identify factors that enable proper post-dauer development.  Completing this project will define mechanisms by which microRNA pathways that control cell fate are modulated after dauer and lay the foundation for future work."

This research experience offers two emphasis areas - devices for diagnostics and sensing and devices for therapeutics and intervention. Targeted student participants include science/engineering majors, especially underrepresented students, from institutions across the nation that lack strong research opportunities. Biomedical engineering research is seen as a growth area for scientific and technological discovery nationally. To attract and retain the next generation of diverse, talented engineers, it is critical to provide undergraduates with research experiences that tie together the elements of STEM - fundamentally based in science and math, using technology tools to achieve engineering solutions - in a context demonstrating societal impact. This is particularly important in the engineering field, where a complementary balance exists between traditional undergraduate training, which focuses on producing applied results, and the academic rigor of hypothesis-driven or needs-based research required to generate breakthroughs. The growing field of biomedical engineering (BME) provides an appropriate and effective framework in which to implement a high-impact undergraduate research program addressing this need. <br/><br/>UNL will host nine REU students over a 10-week summer program. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) provide interdisciplinary research experiences to undergraduates in the area of biomedical devices; 2) give participants confidence to become independent researchers by providing systematic instruction in research methodology; 3) provide participants with a broader view of research and development activities in academia and industry; and 4) expand participants' skills and knowledge regarding academic-industry partnerships, such as technology transfer and entrepreneurship. Structured research activities will be complemented by professional development activities including undergraduate research symposia, designed to prepare participants for STEM careers. It is expected that REU participants will publish research results as lead or co-authors, and project outcomes will be disseminated in engineering education journals for the benefit of other institutions."

Researchers from Purdue University in Indiana and Heritage University in Washington will test this idea by developing and assessing the impacts of geology activities built around cultural connections for Native American students. While some research has been conducted on Native Americans' understandings of geoscience, there has been less emphasis on recognizing and leveraging common connections Native students make between their traditional cultures and Western science.  Thus, a key element of this research is to identify connections Native American students make between introductory geology concepts and their everyday lives and cultural traditions. The researchers will use these connections in modified geology activities that connect to the cultural as well as geographical sense of place experienced by students. This allows the researchers to assess the degree to which enhancing the cultural relevance of introductory geology activities increases undergraduate students' connections to geoscience concepts and careers. This approach may then be used with other student groups and their cultural connections to geologic concepts.  <br/><br/>The GeoConnections project will develop and assess Geoscience Education Modules (GEMs), which are based on cultural and geological connections. The GEMs are also created with the educational needs of geoscience instructors and Native American undergraduate students as a guiding focus for creating transformative learning experiences through metacognitive and reflexive pedagogies. By collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data on underrepresented and majority students' knowledge and conceptions of geoscience concepts and careers, both pre- and post-involvement in GEMs, the researchers will triangulate the impacts of including culturally relevant educational modules in undergraduate geology instruction. This will increase the collective knowledge of Native American views of science within a variety of educational settings and enhance understanding of the impacts of education based on ways that Native American students find relevance in Western scientific concepts through their individual cultures. This has the potential to be valuable to Native American students who have previously been unable to easily find cultural relevance in Western geoscientific concepts, and may provide an adaptable and expandable model to bridge the gap between the educational experiences of underrepresented groups and the overarching goal to create an equitable learning environment for diverse populations."

The program will bring together doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts to discuss spectacular recent developments in the nexus of geometric analysis and general relativity, to assess new avenues for investigations, to support existing collaborations, and to promote new ones.  In recent years, gravitational wave experiments such as that of LIGO have seen striking advances, confirming phenomena anticipated by general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravitation).  These developments have led to a new surge of activity in the study of cosmological models, black holes, and other areas in the field.  The summer school is designed to introduce aspects of the field to graduate students and other junior investigators, and at the conference participants will learn about a range of current research questions.  The ESI program affords young researchers the opportunity to enhance the development of their research program through interaction with established and emerging leaders in the field.  This grant will provide support for graduate students and other junior investigators from the U.S. interested in attending the conference and/or summer school, and who would otherwise be unable to do so without this support.  <br/><br/>The study of the Einstein equations as a model for gravitational phenomena involves deep and fundamental relationships between geometric analysis and physics.  Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts, including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship, dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations that govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem.  Recent advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these areas.  The purpose of the summer school and conference is to introduce graduate students and other junior investigators to the tools needed to approach such results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field.

The objective of this project is to minimize membrane fouling by producing oxygen at the membrane surface to impede the growth of biofilms on the membrane.  Biofouling has the largest negative impact on desalination membrane performance.  This fundamental research has the potential to transform membrane performance by significantly decreasing the energy use of membranes and increasing their usable lifetime.  The fundamental principles learned are anticipated to lead to solutions that are scalable and commercially viable and can improve municipal and industrial water treatment to help meet the growing national demand for potable water.<br/><br/>Numerous efforts have focused on improving RO efficiency by pretreatment, minimizing concentration polarization (CP), and mitigating fouling.  Current methods have not overcome the problem in a feasible manner, especially for concentration polarization; however, no study has been reported on the application of microbubbles generated in situ to disturb the CP boundary layer.  The hypothesis is that catalytically generating microbubbles at a membrane surface will produce localized micromixing, which will significantly reduce both concentration polarization and particle-bacteria-organic fouling.  To test the overall hypothesis and meet the objective, three important fundamental questions must be answered, and form the intellectual merit of this research:  1) What is the rate of microbubble formation, and the microbubble size distribution, given a particular catalyst type, catalyst loading fraction, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dosing profile, and local pressure (i.e., must exceed Henry's law solubility)? 2) For a given microbubble production rate and size distribution, what is the increase in water effluent due to the different mechanisms of micromixing for concentration polarization, and liftoff for membrane fouling species? and 3) For a given microbubble production rate, what is the disinfection capacity for biofilm-forming microorganisms using the produced oxidant (reactive oxygen species), at production levels that avoid membrane damage?  The approach is to incorporate catalysts in the membrane module (either membrane surface or spacers), and then during the operation of the membrane, to inject pulses of H2O2 or other reactants that will produce microbubbles at the membrane surface.  A primary figure of merit for this work is an increased water flux through the membrane over time.  The broader impacts of this proposal focus on educating Ph.D. students (including internships with Dow Chemical, our NSF GOALI partner) and undergrads, as well as technological commercialization (with partner Dow Chemical).  Producing microbubbles and generating localized micromixing could be achieved at commercial scale.  Ph.D. and undergrad education as well as internships and entrepreneurship training will form part of the student experience."

Specifically, the project will (1) identify areas of enhanced accumulation of POC off the Antarctic Peninsula; (2) quantify spatial and temporal variability in offshore transport by nonlinear mesoscale eddies and by winds in a surface Ekman layer; and (3) compare the estimates of offshore transport to the POC distribution away from the coast to identify preferred transport pathways or hotspots for offshore export of coastal water and POC off the Peninsula. This study will utilize decade-long satellite observations of POC based on algorithms validated against in situ data, ocean vector winds, eddy kinematic and propagation characteristics based on altimeter data, and results from a high resolution eddy resolving ocean model coupled to a sea ice model. The study will focus on the Antarctic Peninsula during summer, when reduced cloud/sea ice cover when satellite data availability is high."

The goal of the workshop is to construct a set of visualization competencies that builds across the educational trajectory, is grounded in human perceptual and cognitive systems, is not tied to specific disciplinary visualization practices, and produces graduates who can develop and interpret visualizations of types that have not been explicitly taught. Learners who acquire this kind of trans-disciplinary visualization competency will find it easier to move between and collaborate across disciplines. They will increase their capacity to communicate about science, and thus help to bridge between science and the rest of society. To move towards these goals, this workshop will bring together a multi-disciplinary group including faculty, doctoral students, curriculum developers, professional development providers, visualization creators, and education researchers, working in a variety of fields where using scientific visualizations is a key competency.  The workshop will have two strands: one focused on fostering learners' visualization competencies and the second on assessing those competencies and evaluating the effectiveness of visualizations and their use in education based on those competencies. For each strand, the conveners have cast a broad net for ideas that have been shown to work in some context and are potentially suitable for expansion across multiple contexts. Drawing on the participants' experience and expertise, the group will produce a compilation of instructional strategies that are independent of discipline and show promise for helping to build students' proficiency with data-based and concept-based visualizations. The compilation will be fleshed out with examples from multiple fields.  In parallel with this gathering and cross-fertilization of existing knowledge, the group will identify key research questions about visualization learning that have recurred across multiple visualization-using disciplines."

Its broad scope includes: multi-modal recognition or synthesis of human affect, psychological, cognitive, and neurological affect modeling, affective computing for social and behavioral sciences, and affective interactions for social robotics and virtual agents.  The conference presents latest research in these and related areas and it plays an important role in shaping related scientific, academic, and educational programs. A theme of this ACII 2017 will be to emphasize the affective computing in action. The theme will showcase how affective computing can impact scientific knowledge and address societal challenges. Besides the main conference program, the conference will also feature workshops, tutorials, exhibitions, and a doctoral consortium. This project is to support the travel of approximately 10 U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the 7th ACII conference to be held from October 23rd to 26th, 2017 in San Antonio, Texas, USA.  Besides attending the main conference program, the Ph.D. students will also attend the Doctoral Consortium, where they will share their research results with the community and receive feedback from senior researchers in the field. This will help the students only learn the state of the art in affective computing research but also have an opportunity to present their own work to, and receive feedback from, an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers along with other students working in related areas. The event organizers will make a particular effort to support underrepresented students (in particular, women and minorities) to maximize the benefits of the NSF support. <br/><br/><br/>The specific goals of the doctoral consortium are to provide an opportunity for face-to-face interaction and constructive feedback for doctoral research of student participants; to promote collaborative research with peer Ph.D. students and senior researchers; to develop a supportive community of scholars in the affective computing field; and to support the next generation of researchers and provide advice on academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths in the field. The Doctoral Consortium solicits extended abstract (4 pages plus 1 page for references) from students from any U.S. PhD granting institution whose research falls within the Affective Computing field. Students are expected to be the sole authors on their submission. For student selection, the DC committee is committed to student and research diversity. The event organizers will make a particular effort to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions in ACII 2017 Doctoral Consortium cohort. Each student participant will be assigned a mentor based upon similarity of research interests and experience, and have a one-one-one meeting to discuss the work. There will be a Doctoral Consortium poster session, in which all participants will present their doctoral work or a recent paper that is part of their doctoral work."

This study will examine whether stress from psychological threat helps explain why nearly half of doctoral students overall and even higher rates of women and underrepresented minority students leave graduate school before attaining their terminal STEM degrees. The proposed research will be guided by the self-affirmation theory in determining whether social psychological interventions can be effective strategies for improving retention in doctoral education by helping students alter their appraisal of environmental threats. Since few, if any, studies have longitudinally and rigorously explored factors that negatively impact trajectories of doctoral students and how psychological interventions can alter these trajectories, this research will be an important initial step in that direction. To that end, this study will advance knowledge in the field about ways to increase overall participation in STEM areas at the doctoral level while at the same time help to diversify the future STEM professional workforce. <br/><br/>This research will take on the form of a longitudinal randomized controlled trial conducted among two cohorts of incoming STEM doctoral students at three major research institutions. First-year graduate students will be randomly assigned to a control condition or to either a standard or contingent affirmation intervention. The standard affirmation involves an empirically-validated writing exercise that has participants reflect on their important values. The newly-developed contingent affirmation has participants explicitly link their values to their long-term educational goals. A smartphone application will be used to provide periodic booster interventions and collect ongoing ecological momentary assessment data on students' lived experiences. This method will provide needed psychological and behavioral data to chronicle long-term indicators of stress that may contribute to student attrition from STEM doctoral programs. Results will provide a window into the psychological and performance trajectories of STEM graduate students and the factors that predict attrition and retention, including the effectiveness of affirmation interventions in this population. Results will also help advance theory related to social identity, motivation, and goal pursuit in STEM education and will further expand and extend affirmation theory, by providing needed longitudinal information on the mechanisms underlying affirmation interventions. Testing the effectiveness of tailored smartphone delivery of booster interventions expands affirmation theory in particular and the delivery of mobile psychological interventions generally."

The ability to maneuver (e.g., accelerate, turn quickly and tightly) generally decreases as mass increases, suggesting there is an upper size limit for maneuvering aquatic animals.  This study will evaluate the size dependence of maneuverability of the largest animals in the ocean, rorqual whales, performing natural behaviors in the wild. Custom-designed removable sensors placed on the bodies of free-ranging whales will record their movement while aerial drones with specialized cameras will measure the size and shape of the whales and their appendages (i.e., flippers, flukes) at the surface of the water. By combining these data with mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic forces, different sized whale species can be compared to determine mechanical constraints imposed by size as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world?s largest predators. This project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary research that integrates engineering and physics with biology.  Further, the results may provide insights into the biomimetic design of autonomous underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuvering performance. <br/><br/>Movement is a fundamental aspect of animal life. Quantifying the fine-scale movement of individuals has important consequences for understanding physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Maneuvering capacity is also critically important as it governs an animal's ability to capture prey, avoid predators and obstacles, inhabit complex environments, and compete for mates. Investigations into how animals maneuver in aquatic environments remains poorly understood, particularly for large animals at the extreme of animal body mass. This proposal develops a bio-logging and remote sensing approach, with computational modeling, to analyze the kinematics and maneuverability of free-ranging rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) ranging in body mass by an order of magnitude. Swimming performance (i.e., acceleration: change in swimming velocity; agility: rate of turning; maneuverability: turning radius) will decrease as body size increases across rorqual species and that these mechanical constraints imposed by morphology size will be evident as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world's largest predators. Custom engineered multi-sensor animal-borne tags and Fluid Lensing cameras attached to aerial drones will be used to analyze the kinematics and morphology of rorquals in the open ocean. This approach enables us to quantify the high-resolution kinematics of rorquals engaged in natural maneuvers while simultaneously quantifying the morphological dimensions of tagged animal, including control and propulsion surfaces. By combining these data with modeling where hydrodynamic forces can be calculated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and trajectories"

The project is a collaboration of teachers in the Chicago Public Schools, science educators, chemists, and environmental scientists from the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, Loyola University, and members of the Chicago Environmental Justice Network. The project is significant because it leverages existing partnerships and builds on pilot projects which will be informed by a corresponding cycle of research on teachers' learning and practice. The project will position Chicago teachers and students as Change Makers who are capable of addressing the crises of inequity in science education and environmental contamination that matter deeply to them, while simultaneously advancing their own understanding and expertise. The project will examine the malleable factors affecting the ability of teachers to engage underrepresented students in innovative urban citizen science projects with a focus on the synergistic learning that occurs as teachers, students, scientists, and community members work together on addressing complex socio-scientific issues. <br/><br/>The goal is to provide a network of intellectual and analytical support to high school chemistry teachers engaged in customizing curricula in response to urban environmental concerns. The project will use an annual summer institute where collaborators will develop curriculum and procedures for collecting soil and water samples. In the project, the teachers and students will work with university scientists to analyze these samples for heavy metals, and students will share their results in community settings. The study design will be multiple case and be used to study the content knowledge learned and mobilized by participating teachers as they develop these authentic projects. The project includes explicit focus on the professional development of high school science teachers while it also aims to create rich learning opportunities for underrepresented high school students in STEM fields. The contextualized science concepts within students' everyday experiences or socio-scientific issues will likely have a positive impact on student motivation and learning outcomes, but the experiences of urban students are less likely to be reflected by the curriculum, and the practices of effective secondary science teachers in these contexts are under-examined."

This flow is in large measure controlled by enormous heat losses in the Nordic Seas that transform this water into very dense water that eventually spill back out into the deep North Atlantic. Since 2008, the flow of North Atlantic Water into the Nordic Seas has been measured where it passes through natural choke points: the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and the Iceland-Faroe Ridge (IFR). The measurements come from a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) that scans currents at high horizontal resolution along the track of the high-seas ferry M/F Norrna. While this has been a tremendous success, during rough weather in the winter bubbles are swept down and interfere with the instrument. To mitigate this problem, the instrument was recently moved further aft to the skeg, where fewer bubbles are expected. This project will allow the researchers to assess the improvement in data quality, and participate in the operation of the instrument and scientific analyses for another two years over which the operation will be handed over to scientists at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway and at Faroes Marine Research Institute. <br/><br/>The Iceland-Faroe-Scotland ridge separates two large and distinctly different water mass systems (the North Atlantic and the Arctic Mediterranean) that communicate through warm, salty inflow and dense water outflow through the deep gaps in the ridge. The inflow is quantified with these ADCP current profiles, coupled with temperature profiles from XBTs deployed automatically at selected sites from the Automated eXpendable Instrument System (AXIS) on the same vessel. On shorter time scales exchange is likely wind-driven, while on longer time scales (seasonal and longer) buoyancy loss must be of paramount importance. With sustained and improved Norrna monitoring of the inflows and moored ADCPs monitoring the outflow through the deep gaps (a Faroes-Norway program), one can examine in considerable detail the space-time response of these fluxes to time-varying atmospheric forcing including the well-known North-Atlantic Oscillation."

For example, some studies have explored how changes in temperature and rainfall influence the types of animals and plants found within an area. Other studies have explored how organisms may shape their environment by building structures, or changing the chemistry or rate of nutrient processing within an environment. This study will directly link how environmental changes may influence broader ecological patterns through their effects on the physiology of animals. More specifically, this study examines how changes in the environment directly influence the internal physiology of small grassland rodents and how this physiological stress influences their foraging behavior which in turn influences the types of plants found in their habitats. New technologies will be employed to record and manipulate the internal stress levels experienced by rodents in the field and to track how this stress influences their movement, foraging and feeding patterns. This research is important in developing a general understanding of how organism physiology and behavior scale up to shape ecosystem properties. This study will also inform conservation efforts by allowing land managers to develop strategies that may reduce the negative effects of environmental change on the physiology of animals. This project will support the research training of undergraduate and graduate students and will provide opportunities for K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>The integration of animal homeostatic function into the field of ecology is essential for characterizing and forecasting the responses of communities to changing environmental conditions. Changes in the homeostatic function of animals may, for example, play an important role in structuring the form and function of ecosystems through shifts in animal physiology and behavior that influence predator-prey interactions, levels of competition and rates of nutrient cycling. Capitalizing on recent advances in radio-telemetry and physiological manipulation techniques, this study will experimentally alter the stress hormone and water physiology of granivorous kangaroo rats to track associated shifts in their foraging behavior and habitat use. By applying stable isotopes to flowering plants commonly consumed by these rodents, this study will close the loop between the physiological response of consumers to environmental stressors and its potential to alter seed dispersal and germination patterns. Integration of these disparate approaches will demonstrate a new community (physiological) ecology framework that may shift long-held research paradigms. This ecological framework will provide new opportunities for researchers to explore and test how diverse homeostatic processes (e.g. thermoregulation, ecoimmunology, and nutrient stoichiometry) mediate community function and structure across a variety of ecosystems."

The research examines barriers to combining the two most commercially successful photovoltaic (PV) technologies - cadmium telluride (CdTe) from the II-VI family of semiconductors and crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells - to form a tandem structure with the II-VI solar cell deposited on top of the Si cell for a much higher efficiency than either cell individually.  The fundamental scientific issues investigated will directly enable high-efficiency multijunction cells with only two electrical contacts, greatly simplifying their manufacture and lowering costs.  The program benefits society on several different levels.  On a global and national level, the high-efficiency solar cell technologies would accelerate deployment of photovoltaics - which produce over 1% of the world's electricity today - reducing greenhouse gas emission and international security concerns that accompany other electricity sources, and increasing access to electrical power for disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and around the world, while creating high-paying, high-technology U.S. jobs.  On an educational level, this cutting-edge research provides key scientific training for students from many backgrounds to give them the skills and experience necessary to enter the rapidly-growing U.S. photovoltaics workforce.  <br/><br/>Technical<br/>The goals of the project are to develop the scientific understanding needed to integrate a II-VI top cell, for example the CdMgTe alloy with 15% Mg and 1.75-eV band-gap energy, with a crystalline silicon bottom cell to form a monolithic tandem solar cell with only two terminals for ease of manufacture and use in PV modules, and with a target efficiency over 28%.  The project investigates five key scientific areas:  1) factors controlling the bulk lifetime and grain-boundary recombination of CdMgTe as its band-gap energy is increased from that of CdTe;  2) changes in semiconductor quality caused by reversing the usual growth order of II-VI cells; 3) composition, interface properties, and deposition conditions of the interconnection layers between the top and bottom cells; 4) interactions between the chemically different top and bottom cells that may degrade minority-carrier lifetime in the Si bottom cell; and 5) integration technology for demonstrating prototype 2-junction CdMgTe/Si solar cells with a target efficiency of 28%, well above the highest efficiencies of either solar cell material alone.  Areas 1 and 2 will be investigated at Colorado State University (CSU) with CdMgTe cells made with its single-vacuum, multi-source deposition system.  The quality of the CdMgTe absorber layer will be evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy.  Cells deposited with the n-type layer over the p-type CdMgTe will be primarily analyzed through standard current-voltage, quantum-efficiency, and capacitance measurements and the application of device-analysis techniques developed at CSU.  Areas 3 and 4 will be studied at Arizona State University (ASU).  Varying interconnection layer compositions and combinations will be deposited by sputtering, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and atomic-layer deposition, on high-lifetime Si cells built at ASU.  Evaluation will focus on the key metrics of electrical transport, optical transmittance, and suitability for high-quality II-VI growth on top.  Potential changes in the Si cell due to the thermal budget and recombination activity of impurities associated with top cell growth will be characterized by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, temperature-dependent current-voltage, and inductively-coupled carrier-lifetime measurements.  Area 5, cell integration, will be accomplished jointly by the two universities with target efficiency of 28%, which would profoundly impact the penetration of solar-generated electricity in the global economy.  The value of the project, however, extends beyond photovoltaic cells, shedding light on the fundamentals of defects in low-cost polycrystalline semiconductors, and providing insight on other applications such as integration of light emitters on low-cost silicon for high-speed computing."

Research literature has shown that students' engagement in the learning process is an important predictor of ultimate academic performance outcomes. It is anticipated that the students' socioemotional perceptions should positively relate not only to each other but to student engagement levels as well; hence helping to confirm the academic relevance of such socioemotional considerations. The Student Socioemotional Perception Tool will be modified to assess students' perception changes given their teachers' participation in the professional development intervention.  The study of these social emotional factors with elementary age African-American students in high needs school settings has the potential to advance the knowledge of largely unexplored conceptual directions in need of systematic empirical scrutiny. The Talent Quest Model, based on the human capacity framework, is actualized in how teachers elicit and use student assets with regard to lessons, learning activities, and life science subject matter inside classrooms on an everyday basis. Hence, a major outcome will be modifying a developmentally appropriate measurement tool to gauge elementary level students' perspectives on their relational mattering and sense of belonging during life science lessons beyond its early development and pilot stage."

This meltwater percolates and refreezes within the underlying snow. Over time, this altered snow, which is referred to as firn, can reach to depths of 100 meters. These changes in firn structure consequently alter the heat flow within the ice, and between the ice sheet and the atmosphere. As yet however, the full structure of the firn layer is unclear as observations have been limited to shallow depths. To address this important lack of understanding, the investigators propose a field study focused on drilling a number of deep ice cores, with the goal of characterizing the thermal and physical properties of the deep firn ice. This information is essential to predicting ice sheet changes in volume and sea level rise. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students, an early career scientist, and includes public outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the deep firn in the low elevation regions of Greenland experience densification governed by water infiltration/refreezing and thermally enhanced compaction. The project will develop a novel hot water drilling system to quickly penetrate 100 meters through the technically challenging conditions of intermixed cold and wet firn. In situ data collection will include digital temperature strings, video and core logging, and an instrumented drill stem. This work will yield a full-depth characterization of firn thickness, density, permeability, and thermal status. Moreover, drilling conducted a decade earlier in the region will permit the investigators to assess changes in firn properties over time. Ultimately, understanding meltwater retention and refreezing processes across Greenland?s accumulation area is essential for advancing prediction of ice sheet volume change,flow dynamics, and sea level change. The project will provide field and laboratory research experiences impacting a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The project will support a newly funded young investigator, and will include outreach activities targeting the general public and middle school students in Greenland and Western Montana."

Deciphering the operating principles of olfaction requires the development of innovative and integrative approaches that combine novel theoretical frameworks, improved mathematical models, and novel behavioral paradigms across the phylogenetic spectrum, experimental methodologies, and engineering principles. As part of the BRAIN Initiative, a 5-day focused Ideas Lab workshop was organized in Summer 2015 to bring together researchers from diverse scientific backgrounds to engender fresh thinking and innovative approaches that will transform understanding of olfactory processing in behavioral contexts while spawning new opportunities to elucidate the general nature of sensory representations in the brain. The workshop resulted in three awards to a total of 17 researchers in three project teams. This current workshop brings together the awardees, trainees and experts in Physics, Engineering and Neuroscience to share the exciting developments and findings from the projects. <br/><br/>The workshop features investigators at all academic levels with a mix of quantitative researchers and neuroscientists. An integral aspect of the workshop is extensive cross-disciplinary interaction.

Most of the differences among living organisms ultimately can be traced to genetic variation, including humans. Patterns of genetic differences in a species appear across different groups, due to events such as changes in population size, migration between populations, or long periods of isolation. Understanding, for example, how beneficial mutations can be established in a natural population of a certain size that has migration limits is important for understanding aspects of human health, conservation genetics, breeding in agriculture and many other research areas.  Recent technological advances have made it fast and inexpensive to obtain genetic sequences from many individuals, assuming samples can be collected. A number of software packages provide models that estimate what prior events looked like from current genetic data, including biological parameters such as population size or migration rate. However, each assumes a particular mathematic model of population demography and are limited to estimating parameters from a subset of the biological processes that may influence genetic variation. A poor match between the assumptions of the analytical model and the true population history will produce inaccurate parameter estimates that are likely to mislead the biological inference. This project will develop software that enables biologists to assess how appropriate a particular software package is to a given set of genetic data. Therefore, it will benefit society by improving the quality of biological inferences drawn from genetic data, ranging from efforts to protect endangered species to investigations into the history of viral pathogens.<br/><br/>Bayesian inference is commonly used to analyze genetic data because it provides a computationally efficient approach to identifying highly-probable regions of parameter space, but all such inference is conditional on the models chosen to use in the analysis. While analytical models exist that can estimate parameters associated with all population-level biological processes, such as genetic drift, phylogenetic divergence, gene flow, population size change, etc., computational limitations prevent any given analytical model of incorporating more than a handful of these processes. Biologists typically choose which analytical method to use intuitively, and generally lack approaches for assessing the absolute statistical fit of a model given the genetic data. Consequently, the inferences that result from the analysis of genetic data are effectively conditional on the appropriateness of the model used to analyze the data, although they are rarely presented in such terms. The proposed work will develop and implement a considerable expansion of the P2C2M R package, which currently implements posterior predictive simulation to assess the statistical fit of a single model - the multispecies coalescent model. The work will expand P2C2M such that the statistical fit of additional coalescent methods can be evaluated. By expanding P2C2M, the work promotes the consideration of model fit as an important step within the overall process of making biological inferences from genetic data. Biologists have devoted a great deal of energy to justify the models that they use to analyze their data using verbal reasoning and qualitative arguments, but have generally lacked the tools and statistical framework to do so in a direct quantitative manner. P2C2M will provide these tools by the time of project completion. As a direct consequence of the expanded P2C2M R package, the inferences made by evolutionary geneticists will be more insightful and because researchers and their audiences will have enhanced confidence in the choice of analytical models from which these inferences are derived. The work will enhance biological inferences with important societal benefit, such as the identification of cryptic species, understanding the demography of invasive species and disease vectors, and the movement of alleles across the landscape in endangered species.

The research examines barriers to combining the two most commercially successful photovoltaic (PV) technologies - cadmium telluride (CdTe) from the II-VI family of semiconductors and crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells - to form a tandem structure with the II-VI solar cell deposited on top of the Si cell for a much higher efficiency than either cell individually.  The fundamental scientific issues investigated will directly enable high-efficiency multijunction cells with only two electrical contacts, greatly simplifying their manufacture and lowering costs.  The program benefits society on several different levels.  On a global and national level, the high-efficiency solar cell technologies would accelerate deployment of photovoltaics - which produce over 1% of the world's electricity today - reducing greenhouse gas emission and international security concerns that accompany other electricity sources, and increasing access to electrical power for disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and around the world, while creating high-paying, high-technology U.S. jobs.  On an educational level, this cutting-edge research provides key scientific training for students from many backgrounds to give them the skills and experience necessary to enter the rapidly-growing U.S. photovoltaics workforce.  <br/><br/>Technical<br/>The goals of the project are to develop the scientific understanding needed to integrate a II-VI top cell, for example the CdMgTe alloy with 15% Mg and 1.75-eV band-gap energy, with a crystalline silicon bottom cell to form a monolithic tandem solar cell with only two terminals for ease of manufacture and use in PV modules, and with a target efficiency over 28%.  The project investigates five key scientific areas:  1) factors controlling the bulk lifetime and grain-boundary recombination of CdMgTe as its band-gap energy is increased from that of CdTe;  2) changes in semiconductor quality caused by reversing the usual growth order of II-VI cells; 3) composition, interface properties, and deposition conditions of the interconnection layers between the top and bottom cells; 4) interactions between the chemically different top and bottom cells that may degrade minority-carrier lifetime in the Si bottom cell; and 5) integration technology for demonstrating prototype 2-junction CdMgTe/Si solar cells with a target efficiency of 28%, well above the highest efficiencies of either solar cell material alone.  Areas 1 and 2 will be investigated at Colorado State University (CSU) with CdMgTe cells made with its single-vacuum, multi-source deposition system.  The quality of the CdMgTe absorber layer will be evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy.  Cells deposited with the n-type layer over the p-type CdMgTe will be primarily analyzed through standard current-voltage, quantum-efficiency, and capacitance measurements and the application of device-analysis techniques developed at CSU.  Areas 3 and 4 will be studied at Arizona State University (ASU).  Varying interconnection layer compositions and combinations will be deposited by sputtering, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and atomic-layer deposition, on high-lifetime Si cells built at ASU.  Evaluation will focus on the key metrics of electrical transport, optical transmittance, and suitability for high-quality II-VI growth on top.  Potential changes in the Si cell due to the thermal budget and recombination activity of impurities associated with top cell growth will be characterized by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, temperature-dependent current-voltage, and inductively-coupled carrier-lifetime measurements.  Area 5, cell integration, will be accomplished jointly by the two universities with target efficiency of 28%, which would profoundly impact the penetration of solar-generated electricity in the global economy.  The value of the project, however, extends beyond photovoltaic cells, shedding light on the fundamentals of defects in low-cost polycrystalline semiconductors, and providing insight on other applications such as integration of light emitters on low-cost silicon for high-speed computing."

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.<br/><br/>This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

Since these deviations from rational behavior cut into firm profits, one might conclude that employees who routinely encounter such choices should be replaced with software that is programmed to automatically implement optimal strategy. On the other hand, if human managers have ?managerial insight? that can resolve some of the uncertainty about future demand, then they should be considered valuable assets rather than liabilities. Humans have a broad contextual awareness of the world, but their computational abilities are limited and error-prone. Computers are relatively unaware, but they are unerring and have nearly unlimited processing capability. This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, the co-PI develops a model to examine how a business might best take advantage of human managers? insights while scaffolding their decision-making with technology.  The project will explore whether it is better to have human managers adjust recommendations made by an automated system or whether managerial insight should be translated into a machine-usable format for automated processing with the software holding ultimate decision rights. Implications of these findings to issues like supply chain management will be explored.<br/><br/>The project involves an experimental methodology where participants in a ?newsvendor problem? setting are endowed with managerial insight in the form of a noisy signal about upcoming demand. With this additional piece of information, a manager computing the optimal insight-informed ordering policy should outperform the optimal policy absent this information.  However, in the lab, human subjects fail to improve profitability when making these decisions because their superior demand information is undercut by their inferior computational ability. The co-Pi will explore whether, by  disaggregating the forecasting task (where managerial insight can improve operations) from the order quantity selection (which can be mechanically computed once demand information is known) can lead to truly optimal responses."

What leads to the alignment of a dense community of relationships among medical researchers with a novel set of ideas, and how might this coupling process differ among relationship types? The case of French neurology is an ideal one with which to answer these questions because the structure of relationships among its practitioners well represents that of other nascent disciplines in 19th century France and emerging fields more generally. The project aims to reconstruct apprenticeship, colleagueship, co-authorship, and communication networks among French medical scientists between 1840 and 1900 and to identify the mechanisms that generated the structure of relationships among those individuals who would become neurologists. Data are collected from archives located in Paris, France, and statistical network and text analyses are used in order to address the research questions.<br/><br/>This project aims to explain why researchers collectively orient themselves toward institutionalizing particular groundbreaking ideas.  Most current work on social networks in science only examines co-publication or co-citation networks, which leaves one unable to explain disciplinary emergence. The disciplinary network theoretical framework of this research advances sociology of science in a key way.<br/>At the same time, it advances two central areas in social network analysis. Foci serve as critical organizers of networks, and this research illuminates the process through which emerging foci come to affect social networks. Further, while much research in<br/>network science of science investigates the structure of scientific communities, it neglects how ideas, and other attributes of researchers, as well as the multitude of relationships that usually exist between them cohere into the foundations of a new discipline.<br/>The ability to detect social groups from relationship data constitutes one of the most active areas being developed by network scientists, but no models exist that accurately capture how traits of individuals within networks generate community structure. This research will uncover the mechanisms that produce community structure. The results of my projectwill also shed light on the mechanisms that generate relationships among distinct social networks."

The last 100 years have witnessed habitat changes to the planet at an accelerating pace. Very little is known about how species respond to this, because there are usually no detailed historical records of where species lived or what they were like in the past. Specimens from natural history museums, however, can provide a snapshot in time of what species were like decades ago. This project takes advantage of an unparalleled museum collection of North and Middle American birds from the 1930s to 1950s. Using new technology that can extract DNA from these specimens, the researchers will compare historic and modern samples to understand how the genomes of birds have changed in response to changes to their habitats. Additionally, records of bird sightings from the historical field notes will be compared to thousands of modern observation records collected by citizen scientists to determine how the geographic distributions of birds have changed. Combining research with outreach, an international resurvey effort will work with citizen-science experts at eBird to compare bird species at 300 sites originally sampled between 1933 and 1955. Joint, international field resurveys of 15 historic collecting sites will provide complementary on-the-ground data collected by experts. Results of this research will provide unprecedented detail to changes in the genomic and distributional landscape of birds at a continental scale. All facets of the work will be integrated with an undergraduate research program that will train the next generation of biologists with the latest genomics equipment and techniques well-suited to both the public and private sector. <br/><br/>The researchers will assess changes in the DNA of 20 focal bird species whose habitats have been dramatically altered in modern times. The comparisons of historical to modern samples will test whether species in the western coastal lowlands of southern North America have experienced range expansion due to the conversion of native thornscrub habitat to irrigated cropland, and whether highland conifer forest species have experienced loss of genetic diversity due to habitat fragmentation. DNA will be extracted using thousands of conserved genomic anchors that can capture and retrieve the damaged DNA found in older museum specimens. Later analysis will stitch these smaller fragments into larger pieces, allowing for genomic analysis of diversity and connectivity among populations and comparison between time points. Genomic research using next-generation sequencing techniques, particularly using conserved elements, has yet to study evolution at such a shallow scale in vertebrates.

Robust degree programs aimed at producing well-prepared high school teachers in fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are a national priority that underpin progress in science, the advancement of national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy.  Placing successful STEM teachers in high-need school districts and ensuring the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields are essential.  This Noyce project will address this critical need through developing programs, curriculum, and pedagogies that incorporate effective, research-based practices in STEM disciplinary fields and that include preservice teacher training in cultural awareness and social justice.  <br/><br/>Because this project will be led by Texas Lutheran University (TLU), a small Hispanic-serving liberal arts college, it will establish the infrastructure to produce uniquely trained middle and high school STEM teachers, prepared to serve in rural, high-need school districts in south central Texas. New collaborations among faculty in science, mathematics and education, coupled with expansion of education partnerships with south central Texas high-need school districts will serve as a foundation for the project. As a part of the project's efforts in developing the STEM teacher preparation degree plans, collaborations will be established between TLU science, mathematics and education departments."

Operating like an electrochemical battery, the cochlea is partitioned into three compartments filled with the lymphatic fluids. The separation of the two fluids provides an electric potential of approximately 80 mV that is crucial for hearing. To transduce sounds into neural impulses, there exists constant leaking (depolarizing) currents between the two fluid spaces through the sensory epithelium called the organ of Corti. Supporting cells in the organ of Corti must transport ions to maintain the electric potential. According to current theory, cochlear fluid homeostasis is responsible for the loss of auditory receptor cells (hair cells). The PIs test the converse of the current theory: they hypothesize that the mechanical feedback of auditory receptor cells facilitates the maintenance of cochlear fluid homeostasis.  Successful demonstration of the research hypothesis will significantly increase our understanding of the mechanics of hearing.  The investigators will include undergraduate students in their research project, teaching how engineering principles are applied to biological systems.  Course projects for experimental fluid dynamics and a series of summer research projects for undergraduates will be based on the work.<br/><br/>This research challenges the assumption of diffusion-limited ionic transport in the cochlear fluid. Recent observations show unique deformation patterns of the organ of Corti due to active mechanical feedback of the hair cells. This project aims to connect the active organ of Corti mechanics with cochlear fluid homeostasis by demonstrating a different mode of ion transport?peristaltic fluid mixing. Specifically, it will be shown that: 1) the electromotility of outer hair cells generates peristaltic fluid motions in the organ of Corti, and 2) the peristaltic fluid motions help to homogenize cochlear fluids. The results could transform hearing science by integrating two research domains that have not been considered together: mechanics and ion homeostasis of the cochlea.

It introduces aspects of human language and computation via puzzles that do not require background knowledge.  NACLO has been operating since 2007 and is available to all high school students in the US and Canada, without registration fees or academic prerequisites.  Each year the eight top-scoring students from NACLO in the US meet to train together and then travel to the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).  In 2017, after a training session at MIT, the US team will travel to Dublin, Ireland to compete with teams from 30 other countries.   The IOL serves as a capstone international experience for the winners of NACLO, allowing the team members to compete and interact with other students who share their talents and interests."

Data collected by the US network of weather radars and new analysis methods let us track these migrations. The Dark Ecology Project will develop new resources allowing us to estimate the densities of migrating birds as they have changed in the last 25 years. One outcome will be our better ability to monitor bird populations and their migration systems, and the impacts of various environmental factors. The US network of weather radars has recorded a comprehensive 20-year archive of images of the atmosphere, which provides the baseline information about bird movements. Extracting biological information from the images is not automated currently, making it very slow and inefficient. A team of ecologists and computer scientists will conduct novel research combining methods in computer vision and machine learning to unlock detailed information about bird migration from the entire US archive of weather radar data. The resulting dataset will be freely available, providing an information resource for researchers to estimate the number of birds migrating on any given night, measure the patterns and trends of bird populations, and do hypothesis driven science. The research will advance big data analysis and visualization techniques for large-scale science questions, and will engage scientists, conservation planners, students, and the general public with data, visualizations, and educational material about bird migration.<br/><br/>Dark Ecology will leverage large-scale cloud computing and develop novel computer vision, machine learning, and radar analysis methods to measure the densities and velocities of migrating birds across the US. Deep convolutional networks will be trained to discriminate migrating birds from precipitation and other clutter in the radar data. New techniques for domain transfer and weakly supervised training will enable the training of convolutional networks with only modest-sized training sets. Gaussian process (GP) models will be developed to create smooth national maps of migration density and velocity. Novel GP methods and cloud-computing workflows will allow us to scale to massive radar data sets and analyze the more then 200 million archived radar scans. The resulting data and tools will be curated with open access policies, and used by the research team to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of continent-scale migration.

Urban centers bring together diverse groups and individuals, creating opportunities for both innovation and conflict. Investigating how people negotiate and manage these interactions is important to understanding ideological and demographic trends, which in turn have cascading effects in political, economic, and even artistic realms. An archaeological perspective on these dynamics can be particularly insightful as it expands the types of urban contexts that can be examined beyond industrialized, modern cities, to diverse chronological, geographic, and historical scales. Researchers will examine how communities use social identity to negotiate urban ideological, political, and economic landscapes. Approximately 83% of the United States population lives in urban areas; and this number is projected to continue to rise. This is a global trend as well. By examining the past, one can broaden understanding of the potential ways people can and do adapt to urbanism in a growing range of contexts. Such research also helps illuminate how different political, economic, and social movements and policies may impact people's reactions. This project will examine the impact of two social forces that have been shown to be important global drivers of identity: religion and kinship. <br/><br/>The researchers will examine urbanism's impact on social identity and organization through a study of variability in religious expression and kinship. The research will be conducted on a series of medieval (8th-13th cent. CE) sites across western-central Central Asia, especially focusing on sites in Uzbekistan. Medieval Central Asia was a crossroads for diverse ideas and groups that came together in a range of urban contexts. Medieval Central Asian cities were also shaped by state sponsored spread of Islam and strong local identities rooted in kinship. The meeting of these complex layers of ideology in Central Asian cities makes them a productive context for exploring diverse urban experiences in the face of both top-down and bottom-up identities. In this research, the impact of religion will be examined through burial practice, while local kinship identities will be evaluated through levels of biological relatedness between individuals. Burial practice will be studied through descriptions of grave locations, structures, and treatment of bodies. Biological relatedness between individuals will be measured by quantifying morphological differences in human crania from each site. Data will be collected from excavations of a highland medieval cemetery, as well as from museum collections of skeletal remains and excavation reports. Beyond direct academic contributions, this project will promote international collaboration. The researchers will work with American and Uzbek archaeologists and graduate students to conduct excavations and data collection. This work will include training students, publication and presenting opportunities, and the establishment of labs in collaborating Uzbek institutes, allowing for sustained research opportunities. International collaboration is crucial not only to bring together diverse knowledge sets, but also to build bridges between countries in social and economic realms."

This M3 cycle is critically important in modern chemistry as it represents the most effective way to achieve rapid advances in chemical synthesis and the understanding of chemical transformations, yet this cycle is not broadly implemented in the U.S. chemical science curriculum. The proposed educational excursion will train students to better understand the interrelationship between academia and industry, as well as intercultural differences that they will encounter in a global economy. We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Expert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westflische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Blmich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media."

Although body mass is one of the strongest influences on many physiological traits, effects of body size are not known for immune systems. Through an unprecedented comparative approach, the research tests whether body size explains why some species are more susceptible to parasites and more likely to act as parasite reservoirs, whereas other species are resistant. Specifically, the research will provide new information on how functional forms of innate immunity relate to body size among >150 zoo-housed terrestrial mammal species spanning a broad range of sizes. Results will provide a framework for understanding of mammalian immune variation has the potential to enhance models of disease spread by providing predictions about the level of immune defense expected in species never before studied. The project fosters career development for two young investigators, a postdoctoral researcher, and 8-10 undergraduate research students. Participants will develop outreach activities for zoos and for biology classes at local middle and high schools, to enhance the educational effectiveness of zoo exhibits and lesson plans. These activities will demonstrate how comparative research is relevant to understanding human and animal health.<br/><br/>This project investigates whether and how body mass is related to the architecture of antimicrobial immune defenses in terrestrial mammals, an unstudied aspect of size-scaling. Host size likely affects i) the chance of exposure to infectious organisms, ii) the ability of immune defenses to keep pace with pathogen replication, iii) the ability of host surveillance mechanisms to detect threats in a comparatively large risk space. The project will determine how functional forms of innate immunity relate to body size among >150 zoo-housed species of terrestrial mammals spanning 7 orders of magnitude in body mass. In addition, protein expression for innate immune defenses as a function of body mass among 10 primate species spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size will be quantified. Using zoo-housed animals, which experience similar developmental histories in common environments, minimizes effects of confounding variables inherent to the study of wild individuals. Measuring functional antimicrobial responses is preferable to less direct assays of host defense. The transcriptomic methods will show which innate immune genes, gene networks, and/or gene modules are most sensitive to body mass. This project addresses two Grand Challenges in Organismal Biology, and has the potential to transform how scientists think about host-parasite interactions. The transcriptomic data generated will contribute to other systems biology pursuits, including understanding how size may constrain the evolution of regulatory processes in vertebrate animals. The participants, including 8-10 undergraduates, will develop interpretive displays and exhibits for zoos, and lesson plans for middle- and high-school biology classes to engage and educate students and the public and to demonstrate the relevance of comparative research."

People have significantly modified the earth's habitable spaces and have generated pronounced effects on natural processes. Behaviors typically associated with agriculture including adaptations of increased sedentary lifestyles, cultivation, domestication, deforestation, and controlled fire are the beginning of a world-wide trend in reshaping the earth?s environmental systems. The archaeological record is not only useful in understanding humanity through material culture, it doubles as an environmental proxy for the study of human-environmental relationships. Within this framework, this research contributes to a global narrative of how humans begin to engineer and transform their natural and social environments during the emergence of major civilizations. Methods presented in this research project have wide applicability in geoarchaeology and Neotropical research areas. This research also expands on paleobotanical analysis interpretations in pre-ceramic archaeological contexts, which are understudied in the Neotropics. As a strong advocate for higher education for women and the Hispanic community, Luisa Aebersold shares this environmental research in the Austin, TX bilingual community through various outreach programs such as Ciencias!, GirlStart: Girls in STEM, and Con Mi MADRE (Mothers and Daughters Raising Expectations). <br/><br/>This research aims to study the magnitude and timing of impacts concerning initial human-environmental interactions during the early stages of the Anthropocene, specifically, geoarchaeological evidence concerning the transition of subsistence strategies from nomadic hunter-gatherer into more intense agricultural subsistence strategies in the Maya Lowlands during the Archaic (8000 to ca. 3500 B.P.) to the Preclassic Period (beginning ca. 3000 B.P.). This research requires archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists to critically consider the effects of initial human-environment interactions and how people have continued to thrive in built environments despite environmental stress. This research is guided by Human Niche Construction theory, a framework that informs the understanding of early small-scale populations that is heavily influenced by intentional human behaviors. Combined with the term Anthropocene, these frameworks can be used to understand and evaluate the deep influence of ancient Maya cultural activities and environmental engineering on neotropical forests, wetlands, soils, and water systems. Evidence gathered using a multi-proxy approach will address questions related to early anthropogenic change resulting in deliberate and unintentional human niche construction. This research brings together archaeological, paleoenvironmental, and sedimentological lines of evidence which contribute to dialogues of sustainability and environmental solutions. Researchers will delineate evidence of transformative behaviors, which have long-term effects on the environment and its subsequent inhabitants."

As demand for food, energy, and water all increase due to increased population and changes in diet, it is essential to consider the balance of energy, water, and land resource uses to achieve food and nutrition security, economic goals, and essential ecosystem functions and services. Typical research projects are rather narrowly-focused and carried out by individual disciplines. However, in order to address broad challenges and enable sustainable solutions, collaboration among different disciplines is essential. This grant aims to increase the understanding among different academic disciplines in the US and China of approaches for addressing increasingly important challenges related to competition among food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). Typically, development of technologies, policies, and management systems for food, energy, and water systems are done without considering various tradeoffs that may occur, competing demands for resources for each of these basic human needs, and potential conflicts in policies that regulate each of them. The goal of this project is to enable networking and meetings among different science and engineering disciplines to identify food, energy, and water systems to be studied holistically so that increases in productivity and efficiency can be achieved for systems that provide for increasing demands for these resources. The project will enable scientists and engineers to develop teams to address specific FEW systems and to develop interdisciplinary concepts.<br/><br/>This project will support activities that will enable innovative ideas to be developed through interactions among different disciplines involved in various aspects of food, energy and water research. These will range from technological to social and policy innovations for FEWS program development beyond national borders, and contribute concepts for local, national and global solutions to achieve sustainable intensification of natural resource exploitation and use. The project will establish a US-China crosscutting research coordination network to (i) identify transdisciplinary environmental grand challenge research opportunities at the FEWS nexus, (ii) develop a framework to overcome hurdles to interdisciplinary research both between and among collaborating US and China researchers, and (iii) establish model platforms for education, training, communication and efficacy evaluations of the outputs of international cooperation. Over a 2-year period of strategic research planning, identification of grand challenges, and teaming workshops, FEWSTERN will generate technical whitepapers and guidance documents supporting international collaboration and research. US and Chinese graduate students will communicate project outcomes and goals via social media outlets. Novel system level research will generate opportunities for academia-industry partnerships at the FEWS nexus."

The conference is focused on open questions about the manner in which solar wind mass, momentum, and energy penetrate into the Earth's magnetosphere on its sunward-facing side.  The underlying mechanisms are responsible for the development of space weather disturbances around Earth.  The workshop is timely due, among other things, to the availability of a growing collection of multi-point observations from operating scientific satellites and new techniques for constructing global maps of electrodynamic parameters from both satellite arrays in low earth orbit and instrument networks on the ground. In addition, new insights are expected from comparing mechanisms for the penetration of solar wind plasma at Earth to those at other planets.  An international workshop is particularly valuable for progress because many of the combined data sets are the result of international collaborations. Chapman conferences have a long history of successfully bringing together international researchers (and students) in a workshop style atmosphere to address open questions at scientific frontiers. Such an environment, which intermixes a wide variety of viewpoints and diverse participants, provides a known incubator for new and innovative approaches that have the potential for enabling breakthroughs.  This environment is also a valuable educational experience for students and an opportunity for international networking.  Following the meeting, proceedings will be published in a volume of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Geophysical Monograph Series, which is expected to document the state of the field in this scientific area.<br/><br/>Only a few percent of the solar wind striking the Earth's magnetosphere actually penetrates through our magnetic barrier.  However, this small amount is responsible for the development of dangerous space weather disturbances throughout Geospace and the upper atmosphere.  Understanding the manner by which this penetration occurs will lead to improved forecasting of space weather disturbances and help to address a national priority focused on protecting and/or mitigating damage to critical space-vulnerable societal infrastructures."

The aim is to mobilize high school physics teachers to ""attract and recruit"" female students into science (physics) and engineering careers. The fundamental issues that the project seeks is to affect  increases in the number of females in physics and engineering careers using research-informed and field-tested classroom practices that improve female students' physics identity. The project will advance science (physics) identity research by testing research-based approaches/interventions with larger groups of teachers and connecting research to practice in ways that are both widely deployable and practical for teachers to implement. The project will also affect female participation in engineering since developing a physics identity is strongly related to choosing engineering. The core area teachers will be trained in addressing student identity as a physicist or engineer.<br/><br/>In this project, two research universities (Florida International University, Texas A&M-Commerce) and the two largest national organizations in physics (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) will work together using approaches/interventions drawn from prior research results that will be tested with teachers in three states (24 teachers, 8 in each state) using an experimental design with control and treatment groups. The project proposes three phases: 1. Refine already established interventions for improving female physics identity for use on a massive national level which will be assessed through previously validated and reliable surveys and sound research design; 2. Launch a massive national campaign involving workshops, training modules, and mass communication approaches to reach and attempt to mobilize 16,000 of the 27,000 physics teachers nationwide to attract and recruit at least one female student to physics using the intervention approaches refines in phase 1 and other classroom approaches shown to improve female physics identity; and 3. Evaluate of the success of the campaign through surveys of high school physics teachers (subjective data) and data from the Higher Education Research Institute to monitor female student increases in freshmen declaring a physics major during the years following the campaign (objective data). The interventions will focus on developing female students' physics identity, a construct which has been found to be strongly related to career choice and persistence in physics. The project has the potential to reduce or eliminate the gender gap in the field of physics. In addition, the increase in female physics identity is likely to also increase female representation in engineering majors. Therefore, the work will lay the groundwork for adapting similar methods for increasing under-representation of females in other disciplines. The societies involved (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) are uniquely positioned within the discipline to ensure a successful campaign of information dissemination to physics teachers nationally and under-representation of females in other disciplines as well, engineering specifically."

This element can be scarce. To alleviate this scarcity, a special class of bacteria and archaea, called nitrogen fixers, can derive the nitrogen needed for growth from nitrogen gas. This project would carefully examine one specific method for measuring nitrogen fixation that has been used recently to suggest the occurrence of small amounts of nitrogen fixation in subsurface ocean waters. If these reports are verified, then a revision of our understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle may be needed. The Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry program will be used as a platform to develop community consensus for best practices in nitrogen fixation measurements and detection of diversity, activity, and abundances of the organisms responsible. In addition, a session will be organized in a future national/international conference to communicate with the broader scientific community while developing these best practices.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to conduct a thorough examination of potential experimental and analytical errors inherent to the 15N2-tracer nitrogen fixation method, in tandem with comprehensive molecular measurements, in mesopelagic ocean waters. Samples will be collected and experimental work conducted on a cruise transect in the North Atlantic Ocean, followed by analytical work in the laboratory. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine the minimum quantifiable rates of 15N2 fixation based on incubations of mesopelagic waters via characterization of sources of experimental and analytical error, and (2) seek evidence of presence and expression of nitrogen fixation genes via comprehensive molecular approaches on corresponding samples. The range of detectable rates and diazotroph activity from the measurements made in this study will be informative for the understanding of the importance of nitrogen fixation in the oceanic nitrogen budget."

The complexity of these interactions has presented challenges to our efforts to fully appreciate the neural basis of food intake. However, before we can understand that complexity we must first identify the individual brain circuits that regulate food intake. The main goal of this project is therefore to use advanced genetic and anatomical approaches to identify a novel circuit that contributes to the control of feeding behavior. Identifying this circuit will ultimately allow us to determine how it works together with other feeding circuits that we already know more about to regulate a complex behavior critical for animal survival. In achieving that goal the work will not only increase our understanding of fundamental principles associated with how the brain regulates behavior, but may also lead to unexpected insights into feeding disorders and the chronic medical conditions associated with them that create considerable economic and social burdens, nationally and globally. In addition, this project includes a Summer Internship Program that will provide an integrated research experience for undergraduate students, particularly students who will be recruited from populations that are under-represented in science and medicine. These research experiences will provide such students with experiential learning opportunities that will create a foundation for future success in biomedical or basic research science.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Many studies agree that leptin controls food intake through activation of hypothalamic leptin receptors (LepRs). In addition, recent reports have examined the participation of extra-hypothalamic LepRs. In this regard, we have identified neurons in the rat raphe nuclei that are activated by leptin. Intra raphe administration of leptin increases pSTAT3 expression in discrete serotonergic neurons and suppresses food intake. Using optogenetic approaches, we were able to inhibit feeding behavior when the raphe neurons responsive to leptin were photo-stimulated, and we showed that intra-raphe leptin increases hypothalamic 5-HT levels.zpur overarching hypothesis is therefore that, in addition to direct hypothalamic actions, leptin powerfully regulates food intake by activating LepRs located in the raphe nuclei, thus stimulating 5-HT release in the hypothalamic nuclei where 5-HT exerts anorectic effect. The current project will test this hypothesis by studying the functional anatomical serotonergic connections between the raphe and the hypothalamic nuclei, measuring in vivo 5-HT release in the hypothalamic nuclei that receive serotonergic terminals following optogenetic stimulation of leptin responsive neurons of the raphe nuclei; and identifying the phenotype of the hypothalamic neurons that are activated by leptin-stimulated serotonin release. The idea that leptin is acting at multiple target sites including serotonergic neurons in the raphe will advance our understanding of the regulation of feeding behavior. This research will also be used to provide in-depth research opportunities for students from a nearby liberal arts college, particularly students from under-represented populations."

Professor Frank Vogt of The University of Tennessee is developing analytical and modeling methodologies for investigations of microalgae-based transformation of environmental pollutants into microalgal biomass. Microalgae uptake nutrients out of their environment. Inorganic nutrients are converted by the microalgae into organic biomass. The release of pollutants or contaminants into an ecosystem can alter ecosystems. The hypothesis of this work is that a microalgae's chemical signature, and their biomass production, can reflect the status of an ecosystem. The rationale for performing chemical analyses on microalgae complemented by novel data modeling, is to investigate the microalgae's capabilities regarding compound uptake and transformation when exposed to chemically changing ecosystems. The scientific broader impacts are manifested in that microalgae accumulate a history of environmental events and conditions. Deciphering these events becomes feasible and allows for the detection of past and possibly lingering, ecosystem threats. Educational broader impacts include instructional improvements in instrumental analysis courses. Chemometrics, the mathematical and statistical methods used to improve the understanding and use of chemical information, is highly relevant for the chemical workforce, but is often perceived to be very difficult for students due to the required level of math and computer skills. This work provides tools for students to develop their own computer controlled instruments. <br/><br/>Adaptions of microalgal biomass regarding their chemical composition and quantities in response to their environment are studied by means of infrared spectroscopy and flow cytometry. Moreover, novel chemometric modeling strategies are developed to design predictive models that link the status, or chemical signature, of microalgae and an ecosystem. This combination of experimental and computational methodologies leads to knowledge about sources and sinks of (anthropogenic) compounds within an ecosystem. Gaining an in-depth understanding of interactions between environmental pollutants and microalgae living in a polluted environment is of importance for understanding the current status, and possibly predicting the future status, of an ecosystem. Microalgae can then be converted into environmental in-situ probes or sensors. Student training in this project bridges the all-too-common gap between analytical chemistry and data modeling. Underserved students in this geographic area also have exposure to local industrial research andchemical production facilities."

Such systems are becoming increasingly important in modern society. Examples include smart home and office appliances, robotics, modern manufacturing equipment, medical devices, and automobiles. In many cases, these systems are connected to Internet and form an interconnected system, often referred to as the Internet of Things, with advanced capabilities to sense the environment, exchange information, and interact with humans. Given the rising importance of systems of cyber-physical systems in engineering, business, and social environments, improvements in their design can have major impacts on society. One challenge in designing such systems is to ensure the system is resilient, meaning that it can recover from major disruptions when a portion of the system fails to function or communicate. Another challenge is how to take social behaviors into consideration in their design so that people will feel comfortable to use such systems because they constantly collect and share our information. The goal of this research is to understand how to systematically design networked systems of cyber-physical systems such that they are resilient and trustable. This will include new techniques for measuring key properties of complex systems as well as techniques to design them with better performance. Results will be shared, in part, through open-source software created during this research to help engineers design better systems. Web-based learning modules about cyber-physical systems intended for the general public also will be created and shared broadly.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to create and demonstrate a probabilistic design methodology for networked and deeply interdependent cyber-physical systems that incorporates meta-modeling and discrete-event fine-grained modeling. The methodology will enable the design of system-of-system architecture that addresses functionalities of information gathering and exchange under the challenges of resiliency, adaptability, and trust. An information-based quantitative performance measure for resilience will be created. Mathematical models will be formulated to analyze the information interdependency between individuals. Quantitative measures of trustworthiness will be developed to support trust-based strategic network design and optimization. These novel approaches will be demonstrated and evaluated in a design study of highly networked manufacturing machines in supply chains."

The world remains green with plants because a variety of factors limit the intensity of herbivory.  Understanding these limiting factors is an important goal of ecology.  This research focuses on how the seasonal timing of interactions between plants and herbivorous insects could limit herbivory. The project examines interactions between plants and their herbivorous aphids, which form vast colonies on the flowering stalks of the plants, making them an ideal study system for experimental manipulation. The aphid colonies interact with other insects, including ants that provide them with protection from predators. Six years of data show that when snow melts earlier in spring, host plants flower earlier, and this earlier flowering tends to be associated with an increase in aphid numbers.  To understand what is causing this association, the researchers will experimentally alter snow cover as a way to vary the timing of plant-insect interactions.  This work is important because it adds to our understanding of how changes in the timing of when organisms interact with each other, affect food webs, and the resulting ecological communities. The results will have implications for predicting the abundance of insect herbivores in natural and agricultural systems affected by an earlier arrival of spring. This project will also provide undergraduate students from under-served communities with training in field ecology, and will develop learning opportunities for K-12 teachers and students.<br/><br/>Using a combination of observational and experimental approaches, this research will determine the direct and indirect effects of changes in plant phenology on herbivore abundance.  In this study system, aphids (Aphis helianthi) colonize the inflorescences of their host plant (Ligusticum porteri), and six years of monitoring indicates that advances in host-plant phenology (earlier flowering) are associated with increases in the abundance of aphids. This correlation between plant phenology and the abundance of herbivores may be due to the direct effects of phenology on plant nutritional quality and/or to the indirect mediation of interactions among ants, predators and competitors. This study will apply a structural equation modeling approach to evaluate hypotheses about how phenological cues influence arthropod abundance through these direct and indirect trophic interactions. The study will directly vary host plant phenology through the experimental manipulation of snow melt using plant populations found along an elevational gradient. These experiments will also employ a factorial design to combine plant phenology treatments with treatments that alter the accessibility of aphid colonies to their mutualists and/or predators.  Differences in aphid colony growth among treatments will show the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects of plant stage.  Laboratory assays of phloem sap and aphid quality (e.g., C/N ratio, secondary metabolite content etc.) will complement these field experiments and provide a mechanism by which host plant phenology could affect aphid population growth or the ant-aphid mutualism."

The chip in metal cutting is treated as a by-product, typically as waste. However, this new approach attempts to use the chip by applying tension and thereby reduce and cancel friction forces in machining. By attenuating friction forces, this new turning process assisted by chip-pulling can enable material removal with much lower cutting effort and energy; provide greater stability margins, longer tool-life, and facilitate high-throughput energy efficient precision manufacturing. A potential mechanism of suppressing the chip-jam with tailored cutting tool geometries is  also likely with the new approach. Collaboration with a partner from US aerospace industry will help ensure the technology transfer. <br/><br/>The research focus is to investigate how tension applied on the cut chip during machining processes affects cutting mechanics and dynamics. Effective use of the cut chip requires robust control of its flow. Micro-textured tools will be designed to control and navigate the chip flow to realize application of tension. Analytical models will be developed to understand the link between micro-grooved tool geometry to the chip flow mechanics and chip flow controllability. The effect of applying tension on the cut chip will be investigated. Tension applied to the chip cancels the friction force on the rake face and reduces the cutting effort while improving cutting mechanics. Analytical models and experimental characterization will be performed to understand the effect of pulling the chip on resultant cutting forces, cutting energy, the dynamic relation amongst them, and the limitations. Based on this understanding, chip tension will be introduced as an innovative process control parameter to improve static and dynamic characteristics of the machining process. Machining of precision parts can be realized with lower form errors by minimizing overall cutting forces through chip tension and force control. Reduced machining cycle times and increased material removal rates can be achieved through greater chatter stability margins that can be attained by modulating the chip tension jointly with process parameters."

Nonetheless, genetic science is still a long way off from understanding how this exhaustive list of ""parts"" fits together. This project heralds a transformative shift in the basic mathematical approach to understanding how genes interact, by exploiting the fact that gene expression is a temporal and context dependent process.  For example, every person has the genetic coding to produce melatonin; however, its expression varies through the day (keying on genes in the circadian clock) and it is sensitive to environmental factors like light exposure. Thus the temporal sequence and context of expression are important. However, current approaches to understanding variability in expression have relied on non-temporal statistical frameworks based on correlation. They assume that if genes interact, they will always either be positively correlated (simultaneously expressed among all samples) or negatively correlated (expressed only when the other is not) regardless of context or the changing cellular environment. Though a convenient simplification, such correlative approaches are obviously incomplete, and are likely to overlook essential processes such as thresholding, regime shifts, and gene check-pointing that specifically arise from dynamic, context-dependent behavior. This project will investigate empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an emerging framework that explicitly accounts for both the context and temporal sequence of expression events. The work will be a mixture of proof-of-principle and application to a cell differentiation pathway in mice associated with breast cancers. Development of EDM will provide an important complement to current approaches, with the capability to dramatically increase the efficacy of bioinformatics and systems biology research, and to reveal important regulatory hubs of genes that are non-correlated and thus invisible to current approaches.<br/><br/>This project will investigate and further develop empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a conceptual framework to identify causal interactions among genes and produce mechanistic understanding that can be validated by prediction. As an approach that accommodates the reality of natural (non-engineered) nonlinear (context-dependent) interconnected systems, EDM is well-suited to leverage temporally-explicit genomic datasets that have only recently become feasible. In the first phase, the approach will be applied to construct gene interaction networks during the yeast (S. cerevisiae) cell cycle to explore how an explicitly nonlinear and dynamic approach can reveal information that is hidden to current analytical methods. Building on this, the second phase will seek to develop and implement an EDM approach (static cross-map) to single cell data that necessarily lack an explicit time sequence. The approach will be developed and tested on computational models of gene circuits, then applied to single cell data obtained from a stem-cell differentiation sequence in mice. Work will be validated by comparison to existing ontologies and by tailored experiments to be carried out by a collaborating lab at The Salk Institute.

The key underlying methods rely on developing innovative state-of-the-art text and graph mining methods for effective domain-specific approaches to deal with financial text. Especially, the PI plans to define, extract and track nuance and sentiment topics corresponding to different risk exposures of financial institutions, such as credit, interest rate, liquidity, exchange rate risks, as well as the impact of operational, regulatory and reputation risks, to improve risk prediction and monitoring. The outcome of this task will be a rich knowledge graph of risk based on text and graph mining. The knowledge graph will comprise risk-nuanced sentiment words and phrases for the use in risk analytics and a set of financial risk concepts and relationships among different entities."

The brain mechanisms underlying foraging and predator avoidance trade-offs are poorly understood. This work will therefore investigate how and where within the brain threat inhibits food consumption in frogs that have a highly-developed and easily accessible neural circuitry that controls feeding. Specifically, experiments will determine how a chemical produced in the brain when animals encounter a predator disrupts the processing of sensory cues that stimulate feeding and thereby inhibits the behavior when it is not adaptive. The studies fall within US national interests in that they will help maintain our role as a leader in science and technology by advancing knowledge of how nervous systems integrate information and generate behavior, fundamental goals of neuroscience research, as well as in their potential to produce unexpected insight into anxiety-related eating disorders. The work will also impact science education through the training of students from underrepresented groups who will be recruited through existing programs at Texas Tech University, the creation of new neurophysiology laboratory exercises to complement those already developed through NSF-funded programs, and the generation of new case studies for the NSF's National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. For outreach, the team will create a museum exhibit on sensory detection of prey and the ecology of fear at the Texas Tech Museum and provide supplies and materials related to amphibian biology, behavior and conservation to local elementary schools. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to understand neuroendocrine modulation of food intake in light of the ecological and evolutionary forces that guide optimal foraging. Specifically, the work will identify the neural mechanism(s) underlying modulation of multisensory prey capture by the stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). In the clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, CRF rapidly inhibits prey capture through modulation within the optic tectum, an important brain area for multisensory processing of both prey and predator cues in this and other vertebrates. The PI will now determine if tectal CRF R1 receptors inhibit multisensory guided prey capture. In the first aim, pharmacological and imaging approaches will be used to test if tectal CRF R1 receptors interfere with the processing of lateral line and/or visual cues related to prey capture. In the second aim, the role of sensory afferents and inhibitory GABA+ interneurons in mediating CRF inhibition of multisensory guided prey capture will be investigated. Together, these experiments will identify the mechanisms through which an important satiety peptide interferes with a multisensory pathway required for food acquisition. The findings will broadly impact our understanding of the neuronal basis for aversive behavior and its modulation in vertebrates and possibly shed light on the evolutionary origins of disorders in which fear processing pathways are disrupted. Work associated with this proposal will also be directly incorporated into undergraduate educational experiences, in the classroom and the laboratory, and will guide the development of exhibits in the local community."

It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides ""high throughput computing"": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC ""brand"" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.<br/><br/>Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's ""Account Manager"" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of ""keywords"" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination). Finally, Science United will provide web interfaces letting volunteers see their contribution status and history, and letting administrators add projects, control allocations, and view accounting data."

These have had major impacts on both the continental shelf ecosystem and commercial fisheries. It is unclear at this time how changing continental shelf water mass properties and circulation affect shelfbreak processes and shelf/slope exchange and how the exchange processes in turn modify shelf water masses. This project is the initial phase of a larger research plan originally devised to explore multiple exchange mechanisms involving the meandering of fronts, impingement of warm core rings and wind forcing. To address these issues of shelf/slope exchange, observations from the recently commissioned Ocean Observatories Initiative's Pioneer Array, other historical and recent hydrographic measurements, and remote sensing products will be analyzed. The investigators will also conduct process-oriented numerical modeling to investigate the dynamical mechanisms of dominant exchange processes and to quantify their relative contribution. The ultimate goal of the larger effort is to obtain sufficient understanding of shelf/slope exchange processes and their dependence on key frontal and forcing parameters. This one-year project will focus on assessing the quality and quantity of Pioneer Array data and demonstrating its scientific utility to resolve the exchange processes. The results from this study will be communicated to members of the commercial fishing industry through joint meetings with the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation of Rhode Island. Results on the dynamics, frequency, and inter-annual variability of exchange processes will be shared with fisheries scientists of the National Marine Fisheries Service to gain insight into how shelf/slope exchange processes may be affecting living marine resources on seasonal and inter-annual time scales. Presentations will be made at various public venues to talk about the scientific results and their societal implications.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that i) shelfbreak frontal meanders, impingement of Gulf Stream warm-core rings, and wind forcing all induce significant cross-shelf exchange, and ii) these exchange processes are subject to the influences by the changing upstream, offshore, and atmospheric conditions over a broad range of time scales. . A recently developed theory for the most unstable wavelength and growth rate of finite amplitude meanders of a shelfbreak front will be validated against observations. Transports for streamers of shelf water that move offshore in the periphery of warm core rings will be quantified and compared to a recent scaling developed from laboratory experiments and limited observations. The Pioneer Array data along with other hydrographic data over the continental shelf, including data collected by commercial fishermen, will be used to investigate the frequency and cross-shelf penetration of subsurface intrusions of slope water or warm core ring water. A process-oriented regional model will be used for the dynamical analysis as well as data interpretation."

This flow is in large measure controlled by enormous heat losses in the Nordic Seas that transform this water into very dense water that eventually spill back out into the deep North Atlantic. Since 2008, the flow of North Atlantic Water into the Nordic Seas has been measured where it passes through natural choke points: the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and the Iceland-Faroe Ridge (IFR). The measurements come from a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) that scans currents at high horizontal resolution along the track of the high-seas ferry M/F Norrna. While this has been a tremendous success, during rough weather in the winter bubbles are swept down and interfere with the instrument. To mitigate this problem, the instrument was recently moved further aft to the skeg, where fewer bubbles are expected. This project will allow the researchers to assess the improvement in data quality, and participate in the operation of the instrument and scientific analyses for another two years over which the operation will be handed over to scientists at the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) in Bergen, Norway and at Faroes Marine Research Institute. <br/><br/>The Iceland-Faroe-Scotland ridge separates two large and distinctly different water mass systems (the North Atlantic and the Arctic Mediterranean) that communicate through warm, salty inflow and dense water outflow through the deep gaps in the ridge. The inflow is quantified with these ADCP current profiles, coupled with temperature profiles from XBTs deployed automatically at selected sites from the Automated eXpendable Instrument System (AXIS) on the same vessel. On shorter time scales exchange is likely wind-driven, while on longer time scales (seasonal and longer) buoyancy loss must be of paramount importance. With sustained and improved Norrna monitoring of the inflows and moored ADCPs monitoring the outflow through the deep gaps (a Faroes-Norway program), one can examine in considerable detail the space-time response of these fluxes to time-varying atmospheric forcing including the well-known North-Atlantic Oscillation."

Unsaturated clay-water systems play a substantial role in geohazards such as landfill slope failures, desiccation cracking, and contaminant transport in the subsurface, and energy harvesting and storage. Unsaturated clay-water systems are three-phase porous media comprised of plate-like clay particles, water, and air.  Among those three phases, the interfacial physical properties (i.e., the contact angle and water meniscus curvature) have a significant impact on the hydro-thermal-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils.  While past research has advanced the understanding of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated clays at the continuum scale, the interfacial physical properties at the atomistic scale and their potential impact on the thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior have not yet been thoroughly investigated. This project aims to study the interfacial physical properties of unsaturated clays and their temperature dependence via a full-scale molecular dynamics modeling.  The project will provide a fundamental understanding needed to build a physics-based multi-scale computational framework for modeling multi-physical processes in three-phase porous materials that have a broad spectrum of engineering applications in geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering, petroleum engineering, environmental engineering and science, geophysics, geologic sciences, chemical engineering, and the pharmaceutical industry.

The project sustains and enhances the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which enables scientist to orchestrate and run data- and compute-intensive computations on diverse distributed computational resources. Enhancements focus on the automation capabilities provided by Pegasus to support workflows handling large data sets, as well as usability of Pegasus that lowers the barrier of its adoption. This effort expands the reach of the advanced capabilities provided by Pegasus to researchers from a broader spectrum of disciplines that range from gravitational-wave physics to bioinformatics, and from earth science to material science.<br/><br/>For more than 15 years the Pegasus Workflow Management System has been designed, implemented and supported to provide abstractions that enable scientists to focus on structuring their computations without worrying about the details of the target CI. To support these workflow abstractions Pegasus provides automation capabilities that seamlessly map workflows onto target resources, sparing scientists the overhead of managing the data flow, job scheduling, fault recovery and adaptation of their applications. Automation enables the delivery of services that consider criteria such as time-to-solution, as well as takes into account efficient use of resources, managing the throughput of tasks, and data transfer requests. The power of these abstractions was demonstrated in 2015 when Pegasus was used by an international collaboration to harness a diverse set of resources and to manage compute- and data- intensive workflows that confirmed the existence of gravitational waves, as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. Experience from working with diverse scientific domains - astronomy, bioinformatics, climate modeling, earthquake science, gravitational and material science - uncover opportunities for further automation of scientific workflows. This project addresses these opportunities through innovation in the following areas: automation methods to include resource provisioning ahead of and during workflow execution, data-aware job scheduling algorithms, and data sharing mechanisms in high-throughput environments. To support a broader group of ""long-tail"" scientists, effort is devoted to usability improvements as well as outreach, education, and training activities. The proposed work includes the implementation and evaluation of advanced frameworks, algorithms, and methods that enhance the power of automation in support of data-intensive science. These enhancements are delivers as dependable software tools integrated with Pegasus so that they can be evaluated in the context of real-life applications and computing environments. The data-aware focus targets new classes of applications executing in high-throughput and high-performance environments. Pegasus has been adopted by researchers from a broad spectrum of disciplines that range from gravitational-wave physics to bioinformatics, and from earth science to material science. It provides and enhances access to national CI such as OSG and XSEDE, and as part of this work it will be deployed within Chameleon and Jetstream to provide broader access to NSF's CI investments. Through usability improvements, engagement with CI and community platform providers such as HubZero and Cyverse, combined with educational, training, and tutorial activities, this project broadens the set of researchers that leverage automation for their work. Collaboration with the Gateways Institute assures that Pegasus interfaces are suitable for vertical integration within science gateways and seamlessly supports new scientific communities."

First, a network of exactly dated chronologies will be produced from growth-increment widths of long-lived marine bivalve Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa), the growth of which is demonstrated to be highly sensitive to sea surface temperatures. Radiocarbon (14C) data in geoducks, once cross-dated and placed in the appropriate calendar years, will yield another perspective on North Pacific decadal variability with information regarding long-term changes in water mass age and coastal ocean circulation. Finally, existing tree-ring chronologies from the North Pacific rim will be integrated with the geoduck data to maximize reconstruction power and accuracy in a multi-proxy approach.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve support for an early career scientist, grad student, and post-doc, and will involve undergraduate students in the research activities. The research aims to provide useful insights into PDO variability, the reasons for divergence among regional tree ring records, the environmental settings of native cultures and fisheries in the past, and insights into marine reservoir effects. If achieved, these would be important scientific impacts. <br/><br/>The proposal has an element of risk but that risk is offset by the potential benefit in new scientific understanding."

As such, it is currently believed to be endangered by earthquake and tsunami hazards.  The Nankai subduction zone is similar in many ways to both the Cascadia and Aleutian subduction zones, but Nankai has a much more extensive data base than either of these U.S. examples.  This study will provide information that will help to understand how variations in sediment thickness and type of sediment along subduction zones influence the occurrence of destructive earthquakes and which earthquakes might generate tsunami.  The work also will help to understand the regional extent and potential timing of destructive earthquakes not only in Japan, but also along other subduction zones worldwide.  This study is in collaboration with the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).  The project supports the training of a U.S. graduate student. <br/><br/>This project is a collaborative effort between the University of Hawaii and the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). New JAMSTEC high-resolution seismic reflection data across the central and western Nankai Trough accretionary prism will be processed and interpreted. The Nankai Trough accretionary prism is arguably the best-studied sediment-dominated margin in the world, and thus serves as the type example.  As such, the Nankai region has been the focus of numerous studies, including the new effort by JAMSTEC to collect high-resolution seismic reflection lines across the deformation front along the entire system.  This study will integrate new interpretations with existing data from two 3D seismic and drilling transects along with all available JAMSTEC geophysical data along and between the transects, especially multichannel seismic reflection, Ocean Bottom Seismograph, multibeam bathymetry and Very Low Frequency seismicity data. The goal is to understand the inter-relations between regional variations of sediment thickness, oceanic crust topography, and deformational structures at the toe of the prism.  The work will test the hypothesis that subducting topography, even relatively small irregularities such as small seamounts, causes thickness variations in the subducting hemipelagic and overlying trench turbidite sedimentary sections.  This leads to variations in thickness and width within the proto-thrust zone (PTZ) and to discontinuities in ridges within the imbricate thrust zone (ITZ). Subduction of larger seamounts and fracture zones, with greater variations in sediment thickness, cause regional structural variations in the PTZ and ITZ. The project is also designed to determine whether or not these regional variations are correlated with variations in deeper features such as slow slip earthquakes."

Thus, nanotechnology courses are increasingly offered at community and technical colleges. It is important for these faculty members who teach nanotechnology to enhance, develop, and continually update their knowledge. Professional development programs are essential for these educators; however, face-to-face and ""physical"" hands-on workshops are expensive and pose time constraints which can make them inaccessible for many of these educators. To address the issue, the Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization at Pennsylvania State University will collaborate with community and technical colleges to form a Nanotechnology Professional Development Partnership (NPDP) and develop a live-streaming workshop program model in which course and laboratory training are delivered in a web-based format at very low cost. This workshop model will enable direct interactions, participation of faculty from their workplace locations, and attendance flexibility for mobile participants. Resources and best practices derived from this project will be shared nationwide. The project will increase access to professional development for nanotechnology educators at a variety of institutions, help to strengthen the educator workforce, and subsequently enhance the technical preparation of students and the nation's nanotechnology technician workforce.<br/><br/>The goal of the NPDP collaboration between Pennsylvania State University, Ivy Tech Community College (IN), Forsyth Tech Community College (NC), Erie Community College (NY), North Seattle College (WA), Atlanta Technical College (GA), and Northwest Vista College (TX) will be to develop a quality live-streaming and fully interactive professional development workshop model and resources, and apply it to the nanotechnology educator workforce. The workshops will be delivered via Adobe Connect and Zoom webcasts. The focus will be training and providing course materials for educators on nanofabrication processes and tools, nanotechnology applications, and safety and cleanroom protocols. The workshops will also include laboratory and cleanroom training featuring web-based remote access to nano-characterization tools, such as scanning probe microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, as well as simulated experiments and data analysis exercises. This workshop approach is optimum since it will offer the direct and instantaneous aspects of interaction with instructors and peers; the online aspects of session time and location flexibilities; and the ability to overcome challenges related to cost and resources. The workshop model will be applicable and adaptable to other STEM areas. The project will contribute new cost-effective methods to make professional development and continuing education more readily available to a wider audience of nanotechnology educators, including secondary school teachers."

Although body mass is one of the strongest influences on many physiological traits, effects of body size are not known for immune systems. Through an unprecedented comparative approach, the research tests whether body size explains why some species are more susceptible to parasites and more likely to act as parasite reservoirs, whereas other species are resistant. Specifically, the research will provide new information on how functional forms of innate immunity relate to body size among >150 zoo-housed terrestrial mammal species spanning a broad range of sizes. Results will provide a framework for understanding of mammalian immune variation has the potential to enhance models of disease spread by providing predictions about the level of immune defense expected in species never before studied. The project fosters career development for two young investigators, a postdoctoral researcher, and 8-10 undergraduate research students. Participants will develop outreach activities for zoos and for biology classes at local middle and high schools, to enhance the educational effectiveness of zoo exhibits and lesson plans. These activities will demonstrate how comparative research is relevant to understanding human and animal health.<br/><br/>This project investigates whether and how body mass is related to the architecture of antimicrobial immune defenses in terrestrial mammals, an unstudied aspect of size-scaling. Host size likely affects i) the chance of exposure to infectious organisms, ii) the ability of immune defenses to keep pace with pathogen replication, iii) the ability of host surveillance mechanisms to detect threats in a comparatively large risk space. The project will determine how functional forms of innate immunity relate to body size among >150 zoo-housed species of terrestrial mammals spanning 7 orders of magnitude in body mass. In addition, protein expression for innate immune defenses as a function of body mass among 10 primate species spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size will be quantified. Using zoo-housed animals, which experience similar developmental histories in common environments, minimizes effects of confounding variables inherent to the study of wild individuals. Measuring functional antimicrobial responses is preferable to less direct assays of host defense. The transcriptomic methods will show which innate immune genes, gene networks, and/or gene modules are most sensitive to body mass. This project addresses two Grand Challenges in Organismal Biology, and has the potential to transform how scientists think about host-parasite interactions. The transcriptomic data generated will contribute to other systems biology pursuits, including understanding how size may constrain the evolution of regulatory processes in vertebrate animals. The participants, including 8-10 undergraduates, will develop interpretive displays and exhibits for zoos, and lesson plans for middle- and high-school biology classes to engage and educate students and the public and to demonstrate the relevance of comparative research."

This element can be scarce. To alleviate this scarcity, a special class of bacteria and archaea, called nitrogen fixers, can derive the nitrogen needed for growth from nitrogen gas. This project would carefully examine one specific method for measuring nitrogen fixation that has been used recently to suggest the occurrence of small amounts of nitrogen fixation in subsurface ocean waters. If these reports are verified, then a revision of our understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle may be needed. The Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry program will be used as a platform to develop community consensus for best practices in nitrogen fixation measurements and detection of diversity, activity, and abundances of the organisms responsible. In addition, a session will be organized in a future national/international conference to communicate with the broader scientific community while developing these best practices.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to conduct a thorough examination of potential experimental and analytical errors inherent to the 15N2-tracer nitrogen fixation method, in tandem with comprehensive molecular measurements, in mesopelagic ocean waters. Samples will be collected and experimental work conducted on a cruise transect in the North Atlantic Ocean, followed by analytical work in the laboratory. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine the minimum quantifiable rates of 15N2 fixation based on incubations of mesopelagic waters via characterization of sources of experimental and analytical error, and (2) seek evidence of presence and expression of nitrogen fixation genes via comprehensive molecular approaches on corresponding samples. The range of detectable rates and diazotroph activity from the measurements made in this study will be informative for the understanding of the importance of nitrogen fixation in the oceanic nitrogen budget."

This meltwater percolates and refreezes within the underlying snow. Over time, this altered snow, which is referred to as firn, can reach to depths of 100 meters. These changes in firn structure consequently alter the heat flow within the ice, and between the ice sheet and the atmosphere. As yet however, the full structure of the firn layer is unclear as observations have been limited to shallow depths. To address this important lack of understanding, the investigators propose a field study focused on drilling a number of deep ice cores, with the goal of characterizing the thermal and physical properties of the deep firn ice. This information is essential to predicting ice sheet changes in volume and sea level rise. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students, an early career scientist, and includes public outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the deep firn in the low elevation regions of Greenland experience densification governed by water infiltration/refreezing and thermally enhanced compaction. The project will develop a novel hot water drilling system to quickly penetrate 100 meters through the technically challenging conditions of intermixed cold and wet firn. In situ data collection will include digital temperature strings, video and core logging, and an instrumented drill stem. This work will yield a full-depth characterization of firn thickness, density, permeability, and thermal status. Moreover, drilling conducted a decade earlier in the region will permit the investigators to assess changes in firn properties over time. Ultimately, understanding meltwater retention and refreezing processes across Greenland?s accumulation area is essential for advancing prediction of ice sheet volume change,flow dynamics, and sea level change. The project will provide field and laboratory research experiences impacting a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The project will support a newly funded young investigator, and will include outreach activities targeting the general public and middle school students in Greenland and Western Montana."

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This project assesses the impact of scaling-up the teaching of physics and engineering to women students in grade levels 11 and 12, particularly in reference to retention.  The problem of low participation of women in physics and engineering has been a topic of concern for decades. The persistent underrepresentation of women in physics and engineering is not just an equity issue but also reflects an unrealized talent pool that can help respond to current and future challenges faced by society. The aim is to mobilize high school physics teachers to ""attract and recruit"" female students into science (physics) and engineering careers. The fundamental issues that the project seeks is to affect  increases in the number of females in physics and engineering careers using research-informed and field-tested classroom practices that improve female students' physics identity. The project will advance science (physics) identity research by testing research-based approaches/interventions with larger groups of teachers and connecting research to practice in ways that are both widely deployable and practical for teachers to implement. The project will also affect female participation in engineering since developing a physics identity is strongly related to choosing engineering. The core area teachers will be trained in addressing student identity as a physicist or engineer.<br/><br/>In this project, two research universities (Florida International University, Texas A&M-Commerce) and the two largest national organizations in physics (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) will work together using approaches/interventions drawn from prior research results that will be tested with teachers in three states (24 teachers, 8 in each state) using an experimental design with control and treatment groups. The project proposes three phases: 1. Refine already established interventions for improving female physics identity for use on a massive national level which will be assessed through previously validated and reliable surveys and sound research design; 2. Launch a massive national campaign involving workshops, training modules, and mass communication approaches to reach and attempt to mobilize 16,000 of the 27,000 physics teachers nationwide to attract and recruit at least one female student to physics using the intervention approaches refines in phase 1 and other classroom approaches shown to improve female physics identity; and 3. Evaluate of the success of the campaign through surveys of high school physics teachers (subjective data) and data from the Higher Education Research Institute to monitor female student increases in freshmen declaring a physics major during the years following the campaign (objective data). The interventions will focus on developing female students' physics identity, a construct which has been found to be strongly related to career choice and persistence in physics. The project has the potential to reduce or eliminate the gender gap in the field of physics. In addition, the increase in female physics identity is likely to also increase female representation in engineering majors. Therefore, the work will lay the groundwork for adapting similar methods for increasing under-representation of females in other disciplines. The societies involved (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) are uniquely positioned within the discipline to ensure a successful campaign of information dissemination to physics teachers nationally and under-representation of females in other disciplines as well, engineering specifically."

Hence, they play a key role in influencing ocean biogeochemistry, the composition of microbial communities, and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. The aim of the project is to develop a novel saturation approach to quantify the rates of grazing on phytoplankton by phagotrophic protists in the ocean. As a proof-of-concept, this study will focus on determining grazing rates on picophytoplankton. This smallest size-class of phytoplankton often dominates oceanic primary production and can contribute up to 50% of annual primary production in coastal waters.  Understanding grazing is of critical importance to understanding how planktonic communities function and respond to environmental change has the important societal benefit of potentially more accurately predicting the future of global fisheries and interactions between ocean and atmosphere that influence our climate. The project incorporates experiential education of undergraduates in the research environment and biological oceanography and will be a feature of an Advanced Aquatic Flow Courses designed for graduate students, faculty members and commercial entities. Public engagement in the science will be through Cafe Scientifique presentations and the series of Open House events that occur at Bigelow Laboratory through the year.<br/><br/>The motivation behind this project is that challenges in performing and interpreting current experimental measurements of herbivory by protists in the ocean constrain our understanding of this key process. The basis of the present approach is saturation of the grazers with a surrogate prey, resulting in release of grazing pressure on the natural prey. Measurement of the resulting increased growth rate of the natural prey provides a value for the rate of grazing. The project involves laboratory experiments using cultures of model predator-prey combinations to select suitable surrogate prey and test the underlying theoretical assumptions of the approach. This information will then be used to inform the design of experiments on natural planktonic communities. The objectives of these experiments are to test the efficacy of the saturation approach and to compare results to traditional experimental approaches run in parallel. This research will introduce a new approach to biological oceanography that will have been thoroughly tested, with recommendations for optimum set-up procedures and an assessment of the factors that influence uncertainty in the results. The saturation approach has potential advantages over previous methods. It lends itself to analysis by flow cytometry allowing high throughput and accurate measurements, avoids manipulation of the natural seawater and microbial communities, and provides growth and grazing information on defined components of the phytoplankton community."

Metabolomics is the study of the chemical signatures of the small molecules, like sugars, that are the products of biological processes. Metabolite fingerprints reveal a great deal about the recent activities occurring in biological samples. Knowing how organisms respond to their surroundings gives important leads to understanding events in fields like plant biology and agriculture, environmental and water quality studies, and human health research into nutrition or diseases. The chemical fingerprints are generated using two different technologies, called nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The results can be very complex and difficult to merge. This means the challenges for data analysis are also high, and include requirements to develop new approaches, like multivariate statistical methods. This proposal aims to produce software tools that will extract the most possible information from the data, including data format conversion, preprocessing, validation, significance testing, visualization, and metabolite identification at defined levels of confidence. The MVAPACK toolkit will enable important, currently unavailable data processing functions in the form of freely available and open source software modules, with an impact on data quality, sharing, information content resulting in deeper biological insights from studies that include metabolite profiling.  <br/><br/><br/> <br/> During the award period, this research project will further enhance the MVAPACK metabolomics toolkit by including additional and urgently needed capabilities. Such improvements will include adding features to load and process liquid chromatography (LC)-MS, gas chromatography(GC)-MS and multidimensional datasets; to expand capabilities to integrate multiple datasets for chemometrics; and to automate metabolite identification, which is one of the more challenging and time-consuming aspects of metabolomics. This work will employ, among other approaches, graph theory, covariance NMR, back-scaled pseudospectral loadings, and a combined NMR and MS approach to facilitate the accurate and rapid assignment of metabolites from complex biological samples. Overall, these efforts will lead to an improved MVAPACK software package (http://bionmr.unl.edu/mvapack.php) for the metabolomics scientific community that will enhance the information content, utility, and ease of processing and combining various types of NMR and MS datasets."

The build-up of this need is often urgent because sleep is crucial to many essential physiological processes including learning, memory formation and tissue repair. The increased sleep need is generated in the brain, presumably by a collection of neurons inter-connected via complex electrical and biochemical signals. This system of connected neurons is collectively known as the sleep homeostat. But despite the homeostat's central role in controlling sleep, very little is known about its structure, composition, and principles of operation. This research will construct a functional architecture of the homeostat by taking advantage of the fruit fly that, like humans, exhibits sleep but, owing to its relative simplicity offers a tractable system in which to dissect the homeostat. The proposed studies will develop a new series of genetic tools that will allow precise and controllable manipulations of the neurons and the interconnecting pathways suspected of forming the sleep homeostat. The experiments will be guided by a novel computational model developed by the PI. Results from the studies will constitute the first computational-molecular model of the sleep homeostat and will likely give rise to new testable hypotheses about the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. The interplay of mathematical modeling and genetics in the project will offer unique opportunities in interdisciplinary research and coursework for undergraduate and graduate students, with particular emphasis on involving members traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.   <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>This work will establish a model of the sleep homeostat, a feedback system that adjusts future sleep need based on past sleep, which is both mathematically rigorous and molecularly tractable. The project will exploit the fruit fly to build upon a recently developed theoretical model that suggests that four core biochemical pathways constitute the homeostat of the insect. Parameters of the model predict that neuromodulators such as dopamine and short neuropeptide F describe these pathways. A combination of behavioral, genetic and computational approaches will be employed to link the theoretical parameters to the neuromodulators, thus establishing the first quantitative model of the sleep homeostat with well-defined molecular identities. Objective 1 will examine the sleep-wake dynamics over- or under-expressing candidate neuromodulators to rapidly generate a short-list of neuromodulator pathways. Objective 2 will then use the Gal4/UAS system to target the neuromodulator-producing neurons, biochemically perturbing them by altering the abundance of the short-listed substrates. Objective 3 will overexpress ion channels to electrically perturb specific neuromodulator-expressing neurons and serve as a third independent test in the identification of neuromodulators that underlie fly sleep homeostasis. Together, these studies will lead to a unified, computational-molecular model of the homeostat and, in so doing, substantially broaden our understanding of the neural mechanisms governing sleep. Additionally, the computational and molecular approaches taken in the research will be incorporated into laboratory experiences for students, thus training future scientists in how to integrate mathematical and molecular approaches in the study of nervous system functions."

This instruction set must be ""read out"" by each cell in a selective way, so that cells only generate the proteins they need according to what type of cell they are going to become, how early or late along the developmental timeline it is, and where in the embryo they are. These DNA instructions direct the formation of messenger RNA templates that are used to build the proteins. This project investigates how cells in the nervous system (neurons) interpret this genetic information in a more subtle way, to make unique, longer RNAs that are not found in other non-nervous system cells. A new gene-editing technology called CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) will be used to eliminate the genetic information that causes these longer RNAs to be constructed in fruit fly neurons, to see how this affects the wiring of the developing nervous system. Experiments will discover the mechanisms by which molecules expressed in neurons control the generation of these longer RNAs. Such knowledge is vital for understanding an entire class of mechanisms underlying brain cell development that is currently very poorly understood. This project has a broader impact of training undergraduate and graduate students in neuroscience and molecular biology in Nevada, a state with a historically low percentage of adults with bachelors or advanced degrees. An outreach program called, ""Editing the future"", will be implemented in AP biology classes at a local high school. Students will learn about the huge potential impact of CRISPR gene-editing technology, and receive hands-on experience performing experiments on fruit flies, including using a technique called polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and visualize DNA from CRISPR-mutated flies.<br/><br/>The 3 Untranslated Region (3 UTR) can regulate the stability, subcellular localization and translation of an mRNA. This post-transcriptional control is particularly important for neurons given their highly polarized morphology and capacity for localized translation in axons and dendrites. Most genes in higher organisms express at least two alternative 3 UTR isoforms generated by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). In Drosophila, hundreds of genes express extended 3 UTRs that are specific to neural tissues; however, the functional importance of this is unknown. Many genes involved in axon guidance generate extended 3 UTR isoforms in a manner dependent on the neural-expressed RNA binding protein ELAV. This project tests the hypothesis that extended 3' UTR isoforms generated by ELAV are required for correct axon guidance. A novel approach using CRISPR genome editing to functionally remove 3 UTR isoforms of axon guidance genes will be carried out. Characterization of neurodevelopment in these mutants will be performed. The impact of extended 3 UTRs on RNA localization and translation will be determined. In parallel, the precise mechanisms of 3 UTR extension of axon guidance genes by the RNA-binding protein ELAV will be elucidated. Extended 3 UTRs are found for nine genes involved in axon guidance, and this project will focus on three - comm, Dscam1 and fasI. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of APA by establishing it as an essential component of nervous system development."

By doing so, this project will bridge urgent gaps in our knowledge about how social forces influence SGM access to healthcare, as well as contribute a theoretical model to help future scholars understand how organizations impact healthcare use. Insight generated by this project will address the important social problems of discrimination and inequality within healthcare by helping to decrease barriers to care for minority populations at high risk of underutilization and poor health.<br/>	Compared to heterosexuals, SGMs are in poorer health as indicated by a wide variety of measures and at every stage of the lifecourse?yet SGMs are significantly less likely to access healthcare. Although one primary strategy for addressing SGMs' underutilization in the U.S. has been the creation of SGM healthcare organizations, how different organizational contexts influence SGM healthcare experiences and use has yet to be empirically examined. This project uses interviews with patients and providers as well as ethnographic observation at two healthcare organizations in New York City: one specialized for SGMs and one designed for the general population.  Questions driving the project include: why do diverse SGMs delay seeking healthcare? How do they make decisions about care? What do diverse SGMs understand to be their specific needs within different health settings? And (how) do organizational factors and contexts shape diverse SGM patients' experiences and healthcare decisions? Gathering and analyzing three data sources: patient perspectives, provider perspectives, and direct observation will allow for triangulation during analysis, which will help ensure robust findings about how individual and organizational factors come together to influence minority experiences of and decisions about care."

The project targets STEM majors in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, physics and science education. With support from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, CAREERS will provide scholarships and strategic student support to cohorts of Pell-eligible, academically talented students. <br/><br/>Evidence suggests that not only do underrepresented minority students have reduced access to role models and mentors but they also experience lower expectations from faculty and lack strong social support networks, all necessary elements for college success. This CAREERS project provides a spectrum of effective interventions such as learning communities, tutoring, mentoring, success programs, and a robust career development plan to enhance underrepresented students' success and retention in STEM fields. Specific activities include seminar-style courses, a career-focused science sampler trip, capstone experiences, directed exploration of science as applied to industry, interdisciplinary research opportunities, internships, and outreach presentations. These will provide critical ingredients for successful STEM career exploration and selection. The project will add to the research literature on ways in which targeted recruitment strategies integrated with curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular programming around STEM careers shape the career trajectories of LIMR students. CAREERS can potentially provide a model for STEM programs across the country, especially at liberal arts colleges that tend to enroll a high number of students underrepresented in STEM fields."

Understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the greatest challenges of modern physics and is of paramount importance in understanding the origin and structure of the universe. A theoretically well-motivated possibility is that the dark matter consists of ultralight fields, corresponding to particles of very low mass. The mass-energy associated with dark matter is then primarily stored in oscillations of the dark matter field or in localized defects. If the dark matter takes this form, then instead of being bathed in a uniform dark matter flux, terrestrial detectors will witness transient events when the Earth passes through a dark matter clump or a kind of domain wall such as is found in a magnetized material such as nickel. This award provides support to operate, expand, and significantly upgrade a network of geographically separated, time-synchronized atomic magnetometers to search for correlated transient signals heralding new physics.<br/><br/>Both institutions have a strong history of diversity, with CSU - East Bay being the most diverse university in the continental United States and Oberlin College being the first college to admit African American students and women in a co-educational setting on a regular basis.

To date, no such search for transient spin-dependent interactions has ever been carried out, making the proposed research a completely novel experimental window on new physics. In addition to carrying out a dedicated long-term search using the existing GNOME during the first year of the grant, the GNOME will be upgraded in order to dramatically improve its sensitivity."

They have huge economic value as fisheries, storm barriers and destinations for ecotourism.  Corals are made up of large numbers of interconnected animal hosts, called polyps that house microscopic algae inside their cells.  This partnership, or symbiosis, is the foundation of the entire coral reef ecosystem. The polyps receive photosynthetic nutrients from the algae, and the algae receive nutrients from the polyps.  While a great deal of attention has been focused on the environmental threats to corals, there remains only a partial understanding of the microscale cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that underpin the coral-algal symbiosis. Insight into regulation of this symbiosis will provide a stronger foundation for studies of coral health and coral stress, such as coral bleaching in which the host polyps lose their symbiotic algae.  This project will bring together a diverse team of coral biologists, cell biologists and geneticists to study a small sea anemone that serves as an excellent proxy for corals, which do not survive well in the lab, are slow growing, and difficult to collect because of their endangered status.  In contrast, the fast-growing, weedy sea anemone Aiptasia will enable the researchers to make rapid progress on the study of coral symbiosis.  This award is focused on technique development and swift dissemination of results through online communication platforms to both the scientific community and the public.  A variety of genetic techniques will be developed, including gene editing in both partners to be able to test hypotheses about the involvement of specific genes in coral health and stress.  To increase the effectiveness and efficiency of research efforts to understand the cellular, molecular and genetic foundations of this symbiosis, the researchers will develop and optimize approaches to rear the complete life cycle of Aiptasia in the laboratory.  This award will contribute to the training of scientists and expose school-aged children and the general public to coral reef and symbiosis science.<br/><br/>The ecological, economic, and aesthetic importance of coral reefs is widely recognized, as are the threats they face from environmental stress. Nonetheless, the underlying molecular and cell biology of corals and their resident endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) that are critical for host nutrition remain poorly understood. A major reason for this paucity of knowledge is the lack of methods for mutant isolation and analysis, gene knockdown, gene knockout, and gene tagging. Without these, even powerful genomic and transcriptomic analysis largely yield correlations whose implications for causal mechanisms remain uncertain. This project focuses on development of approaches to test gene function in a rapidly developing model system, the sea anemone Aiptasia and the Symbiodinium minutum (Clade B1) strain SSB01, which can form a stable endosymbiosis with Aiptasia, and can grow well in culture. Genetic manipulation in SSB01 and in small polyps will include morpholino and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to achieve gene knockdown, knockout and gene tagging.  The researchers will identify and test compounds from natural substrates and biofilms to achieve larval settlement, and will identify and test anemone neuropeptides as a means to achieve metamorphosis of Aiptasia routinely in the laboratory. Finally, a set of interwoven communications platforms and activities will be developed to rapidly disseminate information gained in the project to the broader scientific community."

Scientists know a great deal about how TTX normally blocks neural activity, but not much about how animals that possess TTX are able to resist its effects. The ability of newts to resist TTX is particularly puzzling because several of their genes must be mutated in concert - a mutation in only one affected gene would leave the newt vulnerable to TTX's affects, and likely dead. Strangely, newts are not simply resistant to TTX's effects, but are actually attracted to the smell of TTX. In the proposed work, scientists will use well-established methods to quantify the distribution of TTX inside newts' bodies, identify mutations that are likely involved in TTX resistance, examine the effects of TTX on their neurons, and discover how the neurons involved in smelling are activated by TTX. This basic research will help scientists understand how neurons work at a molecular level, as well as how animals adapt to the presence of toxins. Through teaching and training activities associated with this work, the proposed project will also contribute to the development of a science-literate American workforce.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>TTX is toxic because it blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. The proposed work will identify where the different forms of NaVs are expressed in neurons and muscles in newts, specific mutations in these channels that allow them to resist the toxic effects of TTX, and how these structural changes alter neuron function. Using analytical chemistry, histochemistry, and molecular biology, levels of TTX in different tissues as well as the location and structure of the six different NaVs will be examined in both highly toxic and non-toxic newts to quantify levels of TTX resistance and identify mutations that confer resistance. The electrophysiological properties of NaVs in a heterologous expression system and of neurons in the brain of newts will be characterized to determine whether and how TTX resistance alters channel and neuron function. In addition, the adaptations underlying TTX detection in the olfactory epithelium will be identified to understand how this unusual ability evolved. The proposed work will contribute to understanding a physiologically vital class of ion channels, as well as the ways in which evolution at the molecular level shapes nervous system function and animal behavior, both fundamental questions in neuroscience. In addition, the proposed work will immerse undergraduate students in the nature and practice of science, particularly through the involvement of Williamette University students in an REU program at Michigan State University."

The semi-sedentary groups may emphasize or mask aspects of their identities in such boundary situations to facilitate movement and interaction across the borders.  Dr. Patricia Crown and Miss Jacqueline Kocer of the University of New Mexico will conduct archaeological research to understand how semi-sedentary groups located on the periphery of more complex societies negotiated these social boundaries, particularly in a setting of ongoing violence. This research is relevant to understanding how ""alien"" groups manipulate symbols and either try to blend or resist assimilation into a more powerful society. The study also examines the level of cohesion among groups along the borders and how they might band together or factionalize. This broad perspective can inform on United States policies and strategies used to ameliorate violence along the borders today. The project provides educational opportunities including the co-PI, who is a female scientist of Hispanic and Native American ancestry and undergraduates of similar heritage from the University of New Mexico, who will assist in laboratory analyses. Results will be shared with the public through lectures, a museum exhibit, a blog available through the UNM anthropology website, and with the scientific community through publication. All data generated from this project will be made available to the public through digital repositories.<br/><br/>Do semi-sedentary groups living in dispersed settlements share practices and knowledge broadly?  Do these groups also emphasize a shared group identity?  When such groups live on the periphery of a more socially complex polity, do they share, borrow, or copy practices from their more complex neighbors?  The researchers will evaluate the extent of intergroup interaction (village, zone, or across the culture area) and group identity through models of communities of practice and communities of identity.  Groups participating in the same community of practice share a background of learning and their ""ways of doing"" are similar. Low visibility attributes are used to examine the scale of communities of practice based on shared knowledge and practice in the sequence of production for ceramics.  High visibility attributes will be used to examine the scale of communities of identity, wherein groups asserted their identity with shared symbols through ceramic design. The Gallina culture (A.D. 1050-1300) of northwestern New Mexico is an ideal case study to examine these issues as they constituted disaggregated, semi-sedentary groups bordering the more socially complex polities on all sides. They created artifacts distinct from their neighbors and are lived in an area with high levels of violence evidenced by burned structures and skeletal trauma. Analysis from six sites from the Gallina area will determine how proximity to group boundaries affects community cohesion. This project is of broad anthropological significance because understanding how patterns of interaction are related to shared knowledge and practice has implications for how peripheral semi-sedentary groups interact at multiple scales throughout the world."

While the judicial branch has been thought to be a check on the majoritarian power of the legislative and executive branches, state legislatures and executives have the ability to challenge the authority of state supreme (or high) courts through court-curbing legislation. Examples of court-curbing measures include shortening the terms of justices, allowing legislative review of judicial decisions, and eliminating the power of judicial review. This legislation is designed to limit the power of state courts, and to demonstrate the other branches' disapproval with judicial decisions. Consequently, this project will examine court-curbing legislation in the states, which will provide significant information on which branch controls policy outcomes in the American states, and on the extent of judicial independence.<br/><br/>This project will collect and make publicly available an original dataset on all court-curbing legislation and constitutional judicial decisions in the American states between 2005 and 2015. Analysis of the data will focus on how legislative and executive branches use court-curbing measures to constrain state high courts, and whether such legislation influences judicial decision making by limiting the power of judicial review. Institutional rules such as methods of judicial selection will be considered within the statistical analysis. Most prior research on judicial independence in the states primarily involves the selection and retention of judges. Instead, this project will focus on court-curbing legislation in order to examine judicial independence, interbranch conflict, and how states balance their legislative, executive and judicial powers."

It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides ""high throughput computing"": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC ""brand"" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.<br/><br/>Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's ""Account Manager"" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of ""keywords"" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination). Finally, Science United will provide web interfaces letting volunteers see their contribution status and history, and letting administrators add projects, control allocations, and view accounting data."

There will be group discussions of ethical issues and mentoring in science. Students will write a synopsis of their summer project, with feedback and editing, and will participate in a capstone symposium including poster presentations. Participants will be selected from a nation-wide pool based on academic record, recommendations, and potential for research in biology and should be current freshmen, sophomores or juniors at a college or university. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program which welcomes students from underrepresented groups in science. Training will take place in a supportive and interactive environment, and the participating faculty have a strong record of mentoring undergraduates in research and publishing with student co-authors. Students will have an opportunity to interact with scientists with diverse interests, at different stages in their careers, to learn how research is done. Many students will present their work at scientific conferences.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

Days with heat waves at a specific location can be counted by determining the temperature for which 95 percent of recorded temperatures are below it, referred to as the 95th percentile temperature.  Heat wave days can then be defined as exceedances of the 95th percentile temperature, and they occur by definition on the warmest five percent of days.  We can then ask how many additional days are warmer than that today's 95th percentile temperature when climate warms, with the expectation that the answer will be more than five percent of days.  Previous work by the PIs suggests that the increase in heat wave days for a given mean warming can be highly variable from region to region, for example their results suggest a greater increase in heat waves in western states and the northern midwest than in the southeast US. This project seeks to determine how applicable these result are for anticipating increases in heat wave frequency, and to understand the fundamental processes which produce regional differences in the increases.<br/><br/>Estimates of change in extreme temperature occurrence often assume a ""normal"", or Gaussian, temperature distribution, in which the average temperature is the same as the 50th percentile (or median) temperature, which is centered between the 95th and the 5th percentile temperatures.  If instead the median temperature is shifted toward the 95th percentile, so that cold exceedances are more extreme than warm exceedances, the distribution has a ""short tail"" on the warm side.  The PIs show that if warming amounts to an overall shift in the distribution, meaning that if the 5th, 50th, 95th and other percentile temperatures all increase by the same amount, there will be a greater increase in heat wave occurrence for a short tailed distribution than for a normal distribution.  Thus it is possible to gain insight into warming-induced increases in heat wave days by understanding the processes that give rise to short temperature tails in present-day climate.  The PIs hypothesize, on the basis of the large-scale spatial patterns of regions of short and long tails in present-day climate, that the spatial variations in exceedance change are primarily the result of meteorology and atmospheric circulation rather than local factors such as the dryness of the soil.  This hypothesis is tested using observations and climate model simulations, and differences between present-day and projected future climate in model simulations is used to assess the extent to which analysis of present-day tails can account for warming-induced exceedance change.<br/><br/>The behavior of temperature extremes is of practical as well as scientific interest given the hazards to human and natural systems posed by extreme heat.  Better guidance on changes in heat wave occurrence would be valuable for decision makers in areas including agriculture, forestry, health services, and urban infrastructure.  The work has educational broader impacts through its connection with a Research Experiences for Undergrauduates (REU) site at Oregon State University, and it also provides support and training for a graduate student."

These viruses are the most abundant and diverse members of most ecosystems on Earth, having been found in every environment that supports life. The majority of the DNA sequences of newly isolated bacteriophage samples bears little or no resemblance to any sequences contained within current databases. This means that identifying new samples by looking for similar sequences is not an effective strategy. It is therefore crucial to find different approaches to characterize these viruses, which will then help is understand the critical roles that they have as members of microbial communities. This research will develop a new network-based approach for classifying viruses, thereby opening new avenues for exploring virus ecology as well as providing genomic data for evolutionary studies. This new approach will redefine how the genetic diversity of viruses is represented, making possible direct analyses of complex viral communities at higher resolution than is currently possible. Furthermore, the project will unite students from the computational and biological sciences, creating interdisciplinary teams able to carry out this research, with this training taking both in the classroom and laboratory.<br/><br/>The project will develop a new graphical framework for the investigation of viral metagenomes, specifically aimed at putting novel viral sequences into a global context of viral genetic diversity. Because virus genomes are mosaics of genes acquired over time from multiple sources, a 'gene-centric' rather than a 'genome-centric' approach to classify the sequences in viromes is taken. In addition to capturing the combinatorial structure of virus genomes, this approach is robust to variation in genome and contig size that can arise from diverse datasets. Through the development of novel algorithms and metrics, evolutionary and ecological signals in the data will be integrated to inform the network's structure. The network will also be used to test hypotheses driven from the data, in particular the signals of viral host-range.

MPC has emerged as both a leading industrial technology for advanced control, as well as an academic discipline for graduate level research. On the industrial applications side, the scope of the technology has increased steadily during the last 30 years from its roots in process control to encompassing many industrial sectors including: aerospace, energy systems, automotive, robotic systems, etc. During the same time period, the scope of MPC research has also widened considerably and includes both theoretical and computational components.  <br/><br/>The purpose of the summer school is to bring researchers and practitioners together to provide state-of-the-art overviews and tutorials on the latest MPC research and applications. Because of its use in real time applications, the computational aspects of the many forms of MPC formulations have been the focus of intense research efforts resulting in improvements in both online and offline versions of MPC algorithms. The topics that will be covered in the summer school include classical MPC (regulation, estimation, and disturbance models), robust MPC, stochastic MPC, economic MPC, MPC for sampled-data systems, online optimization for MPC, and industrial applications of MPC. The summer school approach to graduate-level education in MPC offers several significant advantages. The one-week time investment is relatively modest, making the class available to a much larger numbers of US-based graduate students. By engaging leading experts in the different MPC topics, the graduate students will be exposed to more expertise than is available in a single semester university course offered by a single instructor. By illustrating the MPC concepts with state-of-the-art and freely available software, the attendees can take home with them the computational tools required for implementation of MPC on challenging applications. The ultimate objective is to raise the technology standard of American manufacturing and operations in a variety of industries."

Many of these new components interface to the grid through power electronic converters that are controlled by embedded digital signal processors. Such converters have a very different behavior than the electromechanical machines and passive devices that have been predominant in the traditional grid. Power electronic interfaced devices have greater overall controllability because of their fast regulating time and the flexible programming of digital signal processors. Depending on the program settings, they can operate under a variety of different dynamic modes. Moreover, a variety of new complex hybrid dynamics have arisen in the power grid whose mechanisms are poorly understood. This proposal seeks to analyze these new dynamics and provide engineering design guidelines that can provide system-wide performance guarantees.<br/><br/>Due to a rapid increase of power electronic converters interfaced renewable resources and loads interconnected with the more traditional devices in the power grid, new complex hybrid dynamics have arisen. In this project, a set-theoretic framework is introduced and a feature set concept is proposed to explain switching behavior, label discrete events and synthesize modes for modern power systems. Under this principle, a passivity-based barrier certificate framework is formulated as a mathematical program to compute the feature sets of corresponding modes such that the supervisory level synthesis can be established. Moreover by taking advantage of converter controllability, a control Lyapunov-barrier function is employed to design a supplementary control to reduce the conservatism of traditional feedback controllers, enlarge the feature sets and provide system-wide performance guarantees. The mode synthesis and control objective is to ensure states operate within a safe range, i.e., within operational constraints. The main research tasks include: (a) establishing the proper mathematical foundation to estimate safe regions with desired properties, namely, estimate the errors and algorithm convergence; (b) design property-preserving feedback controllers to meet system requirements; (c) integrate designed controllers and existing controllers with nonlinearities (primarily, deadband and saturation) to form a comprehensive hybrid closed-loop system design; (d) synthesize multiple modes among different sources under a centralized, decentralized or distributed structure for a connected network; and (e) address scalability issues through alternative program realization of positivity certificates required in the framework of finite and discrete approximations of infinite dimensional continuous space and model reductions."

Scientists know a great deal about how TTX normally blocks neural activity, but not much about how animals that possess TTX are able to resist its effects. The ability of newts to resist TTX is particularly puzzling because several of their genes must be mutated in concert, as a mutation in only one affected gene would leave the newt vulnerable to TTX's affects, and likely dead. Strangely, newts are not simply resistant to TTX's effects, but are actually attracted to the smell of TTX. In the proposed work, the team will use well-established methods to quantify the distribution of TTX inside newts' bodies, identify mutations that are likely involved in TTX resistance, examine the effects of TTX on their neurons, and discover how the neurons involved in smelling are activated by TTX. This basic research will help scientists understand how neurons work at a molecular level, which will increase or understanding of the ""nuts and bolts"" of healthy brain function, as well as how animals adapt to the presence of toxins.

The proposed work will identify where the different forms of NaVs are expressed in neurons and muscles in newts, identify specific mutations in these channels that allow them to resist the toxic effects of TTX, and determine how these structural changes alter neuron function. Using analytical chemistry, histochemistry, and molecular biology, levels of TTX in different tissues as well as the location and structure of the six different NaVs will be examined in both highly toxic and non-toxic newts to quantify levels of TTX resistance and identify mutations that confer resistance. The electrophysiological properties of NaVs in a heterologous expression system and of neurons in the brain of newts will be characterized to determine whether and how TTX resistance alters channel and neuron function. In addition, using a combination of techniques, the adaptations underlying TTX detection in the olfactory epithelium will be identified to understand how this unusual ability evolved. The proposed work will contribute to understanding a physiologically vital class of ion channels, as well as the ways in which evolution at the molecular level shapes nervous system function and animal behavior, thereby deepening our understanding of how neurons function and change over evolutionary time.

This will accelerate many research and discovery projects in academia and industry, where NGS technologies play an important role. Extensive educational resources for interdisciplinary training at the intersect of genome and computational biology will be provided. Training will be offered to scientists, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students. Members of underrepresented groups will participate in all aspects of this project while supporting diversity. Extensive online tutorials will be provided to maximize the educational outreach of the activities. <br/><br/>The specific aims of this project are: (AIM 1) Enhancements to systemPipeR?s user interface and the workflow design framework will greatly simplify the process of running workflows, generating automated reports and designing new workflows. It will also improve user-friendliness to make systemPipeR equally useful for R and non-R users, as well as biologists without any expert knowledge in bioinformatics. The execution plan of this aim includes the design of a central workflow control user interface and the adaptation of new community standards to further increase the reproducibility of analysis workflows. (AIM 2) Automated analysis workflows will be developed for a wide range of additional NGS applications. Most of these workflows will be designed in collaboration with experts of the corresponding NGS application areas. Suggestions from the community will be incorporated as well. Sample templates will be provided for the supported NGS applications to create workflow instances with a single command fully populated with all input data and environment settings.

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.<br/><br/>This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

The ability to maneuver (e.g., accelerate, turn quickly and tightly) generally decreases as mass increases, suggesting there is an upper size limit for maneuvering aquatic animals.  This study will evaluate the size dependence of maneuverability of the largest animals in the ocean, rorqual whales, performing natural behaviors in the wild. Custom-designed removable sensors placed on the bodies of free-ranging whales will record their movement while aerial drones with specialized cameras will measure the size and shape of the whales and their appendages (i.e., flippers, flukes) at the surface of the water. By combining these data with mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic forces, different sized whale species can be compared to determine mechanical constraints imposed by size as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world?s largest predators. This project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary research that integrates engineering and physics with biology.  Further, the results may provide insights into the biomimetic design of autonomous underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuvering performance. <br/><br/>Movement is a fundamental aspect of animal life. Quantifying the fine-scale movement of individuals has important consequences for understanding physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Maneuvering capacity is also critically important as it governs an animal's ability to capture prey, avoid predators and obstacles, inhabit complex environments, and compete for mates. Investigations into how animals maneuver in aquatic environments remains poorly understood, particularly for large animals at the extreme of animal body mass. This proposal develops a bio-logging and remote sensing approach, with computational modeling, to analyze the kinematics and maneuverability of free-ranging rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) ranging in body mass by an order of magnitude. Swimming performance (i.e., acceleration: change in swimming velocity; agility: rate of turning; maneuverability: turning radius) will decrease as body size increases across rorqual species and that these mechanical constraints imposed by morphology size will be evident as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world's largest predators. Custom engineered multi-sensor animal-borne tags and Fluid Lensing cameras attached to aerial drones will be used to analyze the kinematics and morphology of rorquals in the open ocean. This approach enables us to quantify the high-resolution kinematics of rorquals engaged in natural maneuvers while simultaneously quantifying the morphological dimensions of tagged animal, including control and propulsion surfaces.

This process has tremendous implications for the global carbon cycle, but its dynamics and efficiency are fully determined by poorly understood ecological processes that unfold at the scale of those microscopic hotspots. The research aims to identify and quantify those micro-scale ecological processes, in particular with respect to how interactions between species of marine bacteria on nutrient hotspots impact the dynamics and efficiency of carbon turnover in the ocean. To this end, this project will use novel techniques to cultivate marine bacteria that live on nutrient hotspots and to measure their interspecies interactions as well as their effect on ecosystem function. This project will directly train two undergraduate students and one PhD. student.  The findings of this project will be communicated to a broad audience via a series of podcasts focused on how the complex life of microbes at micro-scales impact biogeochemical cycles. These will be developed by undergraduate and graduate students at MIT.<br/><br/>The main hypothesis behind this research is that microbial interactions, frequently occurring on nutrient hotspots, have a significant impact on the rate of organic matter turnover, thereby affecting the global carbon cycle. To test this idea, model marine particles composed of biopolymers frequently found in marine environments will be used as scaffolds for natural microbial communities. This technique will allow the researchers to study community dynamics and function in a controlled and quantitative fashion. This work will identify the main ecological species active in the particle-attached communities as well as their functional roles during particle consumption. The research will also determine how interactions between bacteria in the community impact the degradation rate and the efficiency with which organic matter is turned into biomass, CO2 and other forms of dissolved carbon that diffuse into the water column."

This major mode of Earth's climate system has historically been characterized as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation for which signatures have been identified in biological and physical indicators across Asia, Australia, and South America and even in global-scale trends in sea level and surface temperature.  However, there remains considerable and long-standing uncertainly in its behavior prior to AD 1900 and the extent to which 20th century dynamics are atypical in a multi-centennial context. <br/><br/>In this study, three paleoclimate proxy data sources will be integrated to reconstruct North Pacific decadal variability. First, a network of exactly dated chronologies will be produced from growth-increment widths of long-lived marine bivalve Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa), the growth of which is demonstrated to be highly sensitive to sea surface temperatures. Radiocarbon (14C) data in geoducks, once cross-dated and placed in the appropriate calendar years, will yield another perspective on North Pacific decadal variability with information regarding long-term changes in water mass age and coastal ocean circulation. Finally, existing tree-ring chronologies from the North Pacific rim will be integrated with the geoduck data to maximize reconstruction power and accuracy in a multi-proxy approach.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve support for an early career scientist, grad student, and post-doc, and will involve undergraduate students in the research activities. The research aims to provide useful insights into PDO variability, the reasons for divergence among regional tree ring records, the environmental settings of native cultures and fisheries in the past, and insights into marine reservoir effects. If achieved, these would be important scientific impacts. <br/><br/>The proposal has an element of risk but that risk is offset by the potential benefit in new scientific understanding."

This subject lies at the crossroads of many disparate areas of mathematics, and it has a wide variety of applications ranging from cosmology (the shape of the universe) to biochemistry (the knotting of DNA molecules) to mathematical physics. Surprisingly, many problems in low dimensions are usually more difficult than their analogues in higher dimensions and require the use of invariants that go beyond traditional algebraic topology. The PI's particular area of expertise is in Heegaard Floer homology, a collection of invariants for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, which has been one of the most fruitful areas of research in low-dimensional topology since the early 2000s. These tools bring together several different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, differential geometry, and analysis, and the PI hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among researchers in these fields.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are (1) to make progress on a variety of concrete problems in 4-manifold topology, including knot concordance, exotic smooth structures, and embeddings of non-orientable surfaces; (2) to understand the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties such as the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-orderings on the fundamental group; (3) to establish relationships between the knot invariants arising from gauge theory and symplectic geometry and those coming from representation theory and quantum algebra."

Understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the greatest challenges of modern physics and is of paramount importance in understanding the origin and structure of the universe. A theoretically well-motivated possibility is that the dark matter consists of ultralight fields, corresponding to particles of very low mass. The mass-energy associated with dark matter is then primarily stored in oscillations of the dark matter field or in localized defects. If the dark matter takes this form, then instead of being bathed in a uniform dark matter flux, terrestrial detectors will witness transient events when the Earth passes through a dark matter clump or a kind of domain wall such as is found in a magnetized material such as nickel. This award provides support to operate, expand, and significantly upgrade a network of geographically separated, time-synchronized atomic magnetometers to search for correlated transient signals heralding new physics.<br/><br/>Both institutions have a strong history of diversity, with CSU - East Bay being the most diverse university in the continental United States and Oberlin College being the first college to admit African American students and women in a co-educational setting on a regular basis.

To date, no such search for transient spin-dependent interactions has ever been carried out, making the proposed research a completely novel experimental window on new physics. In addition to carrying out a dedicated long-term search using the existing GNOME during the first year of the grant, the GNOME will be upgraded in order to dramatically improve its sensitivity."

Despite the dramatic increase in popularity, we know very little about the cognitive processes involved in learning a signed language as a second language or how they relate to the processes involved in learning a spoken language. For example, prior research tells us that brain activation patterns during language processing tasks are quite similar for signers and speakers, but differences are observed in sensory and motor areas--how do these differences affect learning a signed language? Moreover, there is an extensive body of research on cognitive factors that predict spoken language learning success--do some of these factors also predict sign learning success? <br/><br/>In order to begin addressing the questions posed above, this project aims to 1) extend the existing research on cognitive predictors of second language word learning in spoken language to that of signed language and 2) investigate the relationship between second language signed and spoken word learning. In order to accomplish these aims, the researchers will conduct a multivariate modeling study assessing short-term memory, working memory, reasoning, vocabulary knowledge, and word learning in hearing non-signing adults and explore how these variables relate to their ability to learn novel signs in the laboratory setting. The results of this project will have theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, this project will provide insight into the cognitive components that are common to all languages and those that are unique to either signed or spoken languages. From a practical perspective, the results of this study will aid in the development of diagnostic and predictive language assessments that teachers, students, and organizations can use when considering second language courses."

Describing how neural circuits respond to painful experience is therefore important for better understanding a crucial aspect of brain function.  To accomplish this goal, this project will examine pain processing in the larval zebrafish, a common laboratory model organism whose brain shares many essential features with that of humans while being small enough to study and manipulate in uniquely powerful ways.  These features will enable this work to investigate how cells that produce the neurotransmitter oxytocin shape the neural representation of and behavioral response to pain, at the level of the entire brain.  Because oxytocin-producing cells are highly conserved and thought to be important in pain processing in all vertebrates, the insight provided by this work will help to create models for neural circuit function that generalize across species.  The work will therefore serve the national interest by advancing our understanding of the fundamental ways that nervous systems process pain, which will not only tell us more about how brains work, in general, but which could also lead to unexpected insights into pain management. Additionally, the use of a simple model organism will enable resources and expertise developed in this work to be easily applied to a variety of planned educational activities at the high school, college, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>While oxytocinergic neurons in the vertebrate hypothalamus are best known for their roles in reproduction, learning, and social behavior, an emerging body of evidence shows that OXT is also an important modulator of the pain response.  As with its other functions, OXT's role in pain is integrative, effecting diverse physiological and neuronal events in concert to influence behavior.  While previous work in mammals has emphasized the analgesic and fear-attenuating effects of OXT, the Douglass lab has recently discovered that, in the larval zebrafish, activation of OXT neurons by acute pain is a central event in promoting defensive ""flight"" behaviors.  The circuit mechanisms behind OXT's role in pain avoidance, the contribution of other neurotransmitters released by the OXT neurons, and the functional architecture of the underlying networks all remain unknown.  The current proposal will use genetic and optogenetic manipulations in combination with whole-brain anatomy, functional imaging, circuit labeling, and behavior, in order to identify the cellular targets of OXT neurons that mediate their effects on pain avoidance and characterize anatomical heterogeneity within the population of OXT neurons with respect to behavioral function.  In parallel, the project leverage its core expertise and resources to create a summer course for high school students in the use of zebrafish as a model organism for neuroscience, and an intensive graduate course in microscopy."

In addition, much of the biomass generated through photosynthetic processes was buried within the Earth's crust and converted into fossil fuels (oils), which today powers most of our engines, supports a multitude of human activities and provides materials needed for the manufacture of nearly all products used by humans. In an environment in which resources, including food and energy, are becoming limited, it is imperative that we understand photosynthesis so that we can increase crop yields, produce new and better biofuels, and develop a variety of valuable bioproducts. A deep understanding of photosynthesis will help establish both food and fuel security and accommodate the future needs of man.  The Photosynthesis Gordon Research Conference will include researchers with a range of expertise and promote the development of transformative ideas and novel projects. To increase the reach of this conference we are coupling it with a Gordon Research Seminar, which is comprised almost exclusively of students and postdoctoral fellows (about 80 students and postdoctoral fellows); these young researchers will serve as leaders in the field for future generations. Currently 16 out of the 42 confirmed speakers/discussion leaders/organizers are women and over 1/3 of the invited speakers are junior faculty (Assistant Professors, junior staff scientists, postdoctorals and equivalents) selected on the basis of their recent novel (often groundbreaking) results and their abilities to effectively communicate that information and build interactive networks.<br/><br/>Oxygenic photosynthesis emerged as a dominant process on the planet ~2.5 BYA, shaping the atmosphere through O2 production and CO2 sequestration. It captures the energy of sunlight to oxidize H2O and generate chemical bond energy and reducing equivalents that can be used to fix CO2 into sugars, starches and oils. Furthermore, it is one of the most dominant processes on our planet, providing food and fuel that supports nearly all living systems. There are still many mysteries concerning the structure of photosynthetic complexes, specific catalytic activities critical for photosynthetic function, the biogenesis of chloroplasts, and the many abiotic and biotic factors that impact photosynthetic efficiency. Photosynthesis is also broad in its conceptual foundations and draws upon knowledge from numerous disciplines ranging from quantum mechanics to ecosystem biology; it strongly benefits from integration among disciplines. Photosynthesis is also unique as it involves events that occur in the femtosecond to day/year time domains, and is continually tailored over evolutionary time to function in different environments ranging from near boiling hot spring waters to the frigid conditions of the arctic tundra. This Gordon Research Conference will explore the dynamic nature of photosynthesis, mechanisms by which it has accommodated markedly different environmental conditions, and potential ways in which it can be used to support man's activities. It will include researchers with a range of expertise, fostering discussions that stimulate the emergence of transformative ideas and novel projects that dissolve borders between disciplines to create informed and unique research on photosynthetic energy conversions."

This is accomplished through an eight-week summer research and mentoring program and a joint seminar series in the areas of physical and materials chemistry.  The students are actively involved in research and in planning the seminar series as a motivation to keep them interested and fully engaged in STEM areas.<br/><br/>This research program advances strategies for the synthesis and characterization of organic open-shell conjugated oligomeric and polymeric semiconductor materials based on polythiophene and quinoidal backbones, and including stable long-lived radicals as spin resources.

This is especially true in those sectors associated with transportation where safety is critical and the number of load/unload cycles a part might experience can be very high, resulting in internal damage. Excessive internal damage can lead to failure and is unacceptable. While a number of established methods for internal damage measurement do exist, a team of engineers and materials scientists will explore a new approach by which micro-scale damage sensors in the form of small particles are directly embedded into critical parts. These are expected to increase nondestructive evaluation accuracy, thereby increasing the safety of aircraft, vehicles, trains, and potentially other important transportation infrastructure.

A synergistic experimental and computational approach is taken, whereby shape memory alloy particles exhibiting multi-physical magneto-mechanical coupling are processed at low volume fractions into structural components, their magnetic responses characterized, and associated data employed in the formulation and calibration of particle-matrix continuum models. These models will consider the bulk response of the sensory particles, their interface with the surrounding matrix, and the design of optimized particle shape, size, orientation, and distribution for the effective location of damage. The scientific objectives of this work are to: i) demonstrate that sensory particles can be successfully embedded in a metallic matrix and provide magnetic signatures during in-situ experiments, ii) acquire sufficient data regarding particle configuration and emitted response so as to calibrate and validate computational models, iii) produce validated continuum modeling tools specifically tailored to the scale and response of the sensory magnetic particles, and iv) provide structural component-based information regarding how particles should be best distributed in the host component matrix.

In particular, magnesium with a density low enough to make it 35 percent lighter than aluminum and 78 percent lighter than steel is perhaps the most appealing of these lightweight materials. Replacing steel structural materials with magnesium-based materials in automotive applications would boost fuel efficiency by more than 50 percent. However, magnesium's use remains fairly limited because of a gap in the knowledge of a phenomenon called twin-twin interactions. Twins are specific features in hexagonal materials that can occur from the nanoscale to microscale and responsible for what is called deformation twinning, which is a major mode of plasticity in magnesium and responsible for its low strength and poor deformability. This research will focus on understanding the effect of twin-twin interactions on the mechanisms of deformation in magnesium by performing modeling at multiple scales supported by experimental observations. The outcome will be a predictive model that would allow engineers and scientists to optimize the processing routes of hexagonal metals for specific structural and environmental applications.

Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be hired as part of the research team, and K-12 students will be exposed to the research through outreach events.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research is to establish a research framework for quantitatively characterizing and predicting the twinning induced microstructures and mechanical properties of hexagonal materials. It will link the macroscopic plastic responses to the crystallographic mechanisms causing them, while also accounting for microstructure evolution. To do so, the research team will characterize microstructures of twin-twin boundaries at the atomic level through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopes; identify twin-twin boundaries dominated deformation mechanisms at the atomic-/micro-scales by using atomistic simulations and in situ nanomechanical testing in scanning electron microscopies; establish twin-twin interaction models at the meso-scale by combining in situ mechanical testing and finite element analysis, and implement the meso-scale models into macro-scale effective-medium polycrystal plasticity models. The numerical and experimental tools developed through this project will eventually enable design of manufacturing processes for specific structural and environmental applications."

Conjugation with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or PEGylation has been widely used to increase protein stability, but often accompanies an unwanted detrimental effect on protein bioactivity.

The objectives of this work are to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of biomaterials in protein bioactivity when these biomaterials are conjugated to proteins and to develop new conjugates with improved stability, but minimum bioactivity loss. The success of this work will provide a fundamental understanding of the interactions of biomaterials with biomolecules and macromolecules at the molecular level and guide the design of new protein-conjugates for practical applications.

The objectives of this work are to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of biomaterials in the bioactivity of polymer (or peptide)-protein conjugates and to develop new conjugates with improved stability, but minimum bioactivity loss. Through this work, it will be demonstrated that conjugation with zwitterionic polymers (or zwitterlation) or alternating-charge EK peptides (or EKylation) is better than PEGylation to retain protein bioactivity. In this work, several new biomaterials of different architectures, different types, and well-defined lengths will be used. Interferon (IFN)-alfa-2a will be used as a model protein for this fundamental study since the bioactivity of PEGylated (IFN)-alfa-2a is only 7% of its native form. This work employs state-of-the-art biomaterials and protein conjugation methods to solve one long-standing issue, i.e., significant bioactivity loss after PEGylation, particularly for large binding targets.

The ability to maneuver (e.g., accelerate, turn quickly and tightly) generally decreases as mass increases, suggesting there is an upper size limit for maneuvering aquatic animals.  This study will evaluate the size dependence of maneuverability of the largest animals in the ocean, rorqual whales, performing natural behaviors in the wild. Custom-designed removable sensors placed on the bodies of free-ranging whales will record their movement while aerial drones with specialized cameras will measure the size and shape of the whales and their appendages (i.e., flippers, flukes) at the surface of the water. By combining these data with mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic forces, different sized whale species can be compared to determine mechanical constraints imposed by size as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world?s largest predators. This project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary research that integrates engineering and physics with biology.  Further, the results may provide insights into the biomimetic design of autonomous underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuvering performance. <br/><br/>Movement is a fundamental aspect of animal life. Quantifying the fine-scale movement of individuals has important consequences for understanding physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Maneuvering capacity is also critically important as it governs an animal's ability to capture prey, avoid predators and obstacles, inhabit complex environments, and compete for mates. Investigations into how animals maneuver in aquatic environments remains poorly understood, particularly for large animals at the extreme of animal body mass. This proposal develops a bio-logging and remote sensing approach, with computational modeling, to analyze the kinematics and maneuverability of free-ranging rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) ranging in body mass by an order of magnitude. Swimming performance (i.e., acceleration: change in swimming velocity; agility: rate of turning; maneuverability: turning radius) will decrease as body size increases across rorqual species and that these mechanical constraints imposed by morphology size will be evident as a driving force in the ecology and evolution of the world's largest predators. Custom engineered multi-sensor animal-borne tags and Fluid Lensing cameras attached to aerial drones will be used to analyze the kinematics and morphology of rorquals in the open ocean. This approach enables us to quantify the high-resolution kinematics of rorquals engaged in natural maneuvers while simultaneously quantifying the morphological dimensions of tagged animal, including control and propulsion surfaces.

This project would carefully examine one specific method for measuring nitrogen fixation that has been used recently to suggest the occurrence of small amounts of nitrogen fixation in subsurface ocean waters. If these reports are verified, then a revision of our understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle may be needed. The Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry program will be used as a platform to develop community consensus for best practices in nitrogen fixation measurements and detection of diversity, activity, and abundances of the organisms responsible. In addition, a session will be organized in a future national/international conference to communicate with the broader scientific community while developing these best practices.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to conduct a thorough examination of potential experimental and analytical errors inherent to the 15N2-tracer nitrogen fixation method, in tandem with comprehensive molecular measurements, in mesopelagic ocean waters. Samples will be collected and experimental work conducted on a cruise transect in the North Atlantic Ocean, followed by analytical work in the laboratory. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine the minimum quantifiable rates of 15N2 fixation based on incubations of mesopelagic waters via characterization of sources of experimental and analytical error, and (2) seek evidence of presence and expression of nitrogen fixation genes via comprehensive molecular approaches on corresponding samples. The range of detectable rates and diazotroph activity from the measurements made in this study will be informative for the understanding of the importance of nitrogen fixation in the oceanic nitrogen budget."

These viruses are the most abundant and diverse members of most ecosystems on Earth, having been found in every environment that supports life. The majority of the DNA sequences of newly isolated bacteriophage samples bears little or no resemblance to any sequences contained within current databases. This means that identifying new samples by looking for similar sequences is not an effective strategy. It is therefore crucial to find different approaches to characterize these viruses, which will then help is understand the critical roles that they have as members of microbial communities. This research will develop a new network-based approach for classifying viruses, thereby opening new avenues for exploring virus ecology as well as providing genomic data for evolutionary studies. This new approach will redefine how the genetic diversity of viruses is represented, making possible direct analyses of complex viral communities at higher resolution than is currently possible. Furthermore, the project will unite students from the computational and biological sciences, creating interdisciplinary teams able to carry out this research, with this training taking both in the classroom and laboratory.<br/><br/>The project will develop a new graphical framework for the investigation of viral metagenomes, specifically aimed at putting novel viral sequences into a global context of viral genetic diversity. Because virus genomes are mosaics of genes acquired over time from multiple sources, a 'gene-centric' rather than a 'genome-centric' approach to classify the sequences in viromes is taken. In addition to capturing the combinatorial structure of virus genomes, this approach is robust to variation in genome and contig size that can arise from diverse datasets. Through the development of novel algorithms and metrics, evolutionary and ecological signals in the data will be integrated to inform the network's structure. The network will also be used to test hypotheses driven from the data, in particular the signals of viral host-range.

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.<br/><br/>This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

The striatum, a major part of a key motor system in the brain called basal ganglia, is known to exert a fundamental role in controlling the execution of habitual actions. What is not known is exactly how the striatum coordinates the activity of its neurons to ensure proper execution of habitual actions. Recent findings suggest that a particular neurotransmitter transporter, the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, might act as a key player in controlling the time course of excitatory transmission in multiple regions of the brain, including in the striatum. This research project will determine how EAAT3 controls glutamatergic signaling and synaptic integration onto two distinct types of striatal neurons. To accomplish this goal, the investigators use a comprehensive and multidisciplinary toolbox that includes electrophysiological, optical imaging, and computer modeling approaches, as well as mice genetically-engineered that express either D1- or D2-type dopamine neurons.. The project includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines while advancing and transforming our knowledge of striatal circuits. Inclusion of underrepresented minorities and public engagement activities are an integral part of the project, to broaden its impact with the general public.<br/><br/>Our ability to perform movements relies on the activity of a neuronal circuit known as the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway. Relay of information in the CSTC pathway relies on the coordinated activation of neurons in the striatum, a major node of the CSTC pathway. The striatum is largely composed of two types of long-projection neurons that express either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in the striatum but their role in controlling the coordinated activity of striatal neurons remains enigmatic. The first goal of this project is to determine how neuronal glutamate transporters regulate excitatory transmission in D1- and D2-expressing neurons. The second goal is to determine how these transporters shape the temporal accuracy with which these cells relay information from incoming excitatory inputs. The experimental strategies entail innovative multi-disciplinary approaches based on electrophysiology, optogenetics, imaging and computer modeling. The proposed research will generate new knowledge on the functional role of glutamate transporters in the activity patterns and dynamics of circuits implicated in habitual movement execution."

But extratropical weather systems can interact strongly with tropical weather and climate through a variety of pathways.  One consequential example  is atmospheric rivers (ARs), in which southerly winds in midlatitude systems produce narrow filaments of moisture extending from the tropics to the midlatitudes, where they produce heavy rain and flooding in regions such as coastal California.  Another example is the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a large pattern of tropical precipitation and atmospheric circulation that forms in the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward into the central tropical Pacific.  The MJO has a variety of effects on midlatitude weather, including an increase in ARs along the US west coast and meanders of the jet stream that cause heat waves and cold air outbreaks.  A key question for the MJO and for tropical-extratropical interactions on longer timescales is the role of air-sea coupling, as the importance of changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and subsurface ocean heat storage due to wind-driven evaporation is currently an open question.<br/><br/>This project attempts to isolate the fundamental dynamics which drive the MJO, ARs, and slower variations known as meridional modes in which variability in the midlatitudes causes SST anomalies which propagate into the tropics over a year or two. The PIs develop and use a hierarchy of numerical model configurations at varying levels of complexity, in which the most complex configuration is used to realistically simulate the phenomena of interest.  Progressively simpler model versions are used to reduce the complexity of the simulation so that the PIs can factor out non-essential details, allowing them to analyze the underlying dynamics in their simplest and most comprehensible form.  For example, preliminary work shows that ARs can be produced in an ""aquaplanet"" model, in which the continents are replaced by ocean surface and SSTs are approximated as a simple function of latitude (warm near the equator and gradually cooling towards the poles).  The simulation produces credible ARs despite the lack of continents, seasonality, and realistic SSTs, suggesting that the fundamental dynamics of ARs are best examined in simple models which lack these complexities.<br/><br/>Models in the hierarchy are versions of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), to which the PIs will add an aquaplanet version with ""superparameterized"" convection that is more appropriate for simulating the MJO, and two new representations of the ocean mixed layer.  One version adds a simplified cooling rate calculation and relaxation to a specified temperature profile, a configuration which is sufficient to reproduce cold wakes behind tropical cyclones.  The other is essentially the full physics mixed layer model from the Parallel Ocean Program, implemented in stand-alone columns at each ocean surface gridpoint.  Comparisons between simulations with simpler and more complex mixed layers are used to understand the dependence of the MJO and meridional mode on the physics determining heat and moisture exchange between the ocean and overlying atmosphere.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts through the development of the model hierarchy.  The model versions developed in this project will be made available to the research community as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which is hosted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  They are part of an ongoing effort to developer simpler models using the CESM code base (which includes CAM5), and will be supported with documentation and reference simulations.  More broadly, tropical-extratropical interactions are of societal as well as scientific interest due to their influence on US weather extremes."

The fundamental issues that the project seeks is to affect  increases in the number of females in physics and engineering careers using research-informed and field-tested classroom practices that improve female students' physics identity. The project will advance science (physics) identity research by testing research-based approaches/interventions with larger groups of teachers and connecting research to practice in ways that are both widely deployable and practical for teachers to implement. The project will also affect female participation in engineering since developing a physics identity is strongly related to choosing engineering. The core area teachers will be trained in addressing student identity as a physicist or engineer.<br/><br/>In this project, two research universities (Florida International University, Texas A&M-Commerce) and the two largest national organizations in physics (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) will work together using approaches/interventions drawn from prior research results that will be tested with teachers in three states (24 teachers, 8 in each state) using an experimental design with control and treatment groups. The project proposes three phases: 1. Refine already established interventions for improving female physics identity for use on a massive national level which will be assessed through previously validated and reliable surveys and sound research design; 2. Launch a massive national campaign involving workshops, training modules, and mass communication approaches to reach and attempt to mobilize 16,000 of the 27,000 physics teachers nationwide to attract and recruit at least one female student to physics using the intervention approaches refines in phase 1 and other classroom approaches shown to improve female physics identity; and 3. Evaluate of the success of the campaign through surveys of high school physics teachers (subjective data) and data from the Higher Education Research Institute to monitor female student increases in freshmen declaring a physics major during the years following the campaign (objective data). The interventions will focus on developing female students' physics identity, a construct which has been found to be strongly related to career choice and persistence in physics. The project has the potential to reduce or eliminate the gender gap in the field of physics. In addition, the increase in female physics identity is likely to also increase female representation in engineering majors. Therefore, the work will lay the groundwork for adapting similar methods for increasing under-representation of females in other disciplines. The societies involved (American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teachers) are uniquely positioned within the discipline to ensure a successful campaign of information dissemination to physics teachers nationally and under-representation of females in other disciplines as well, engineering specifically."

Market logics suggest that social ventures may act like for-profit businesses and compete in capital markets to earn profits. At the same time, social ventures may also follow community logics by adopting the key principles of nonprofit organizing. The data will also be used to understand how market logics and community logics influence social ventures' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and inter-organizational networks to create social innovations."

Direct solution of the SSD equations is a new approach to investigating the dynamics of turbulent flows that makes accessible to study mechanisms and phenomena in the dynamics that are inaccessible to analysis based on simulations of individual turbulent state realizations or on statistical mean quantities obtained by averaging ensembles of individual turbulent state realizations.  Illustrative of such a mechanism is the cooperative instability of turbulence/mean-flow interaction that results in small scale shear and buoyancy layering in the stratified turbulence of both the atmosphere and ocean. This layering instability arises as an analytic bifurcation in the SSD of stratified turbulence while having no analytic counterpart in the dynamics of realizations, although the same layering phenomenon is seen in both SSD and realizations. In this research, SSD will be extended to obtain a theory for the spontaneous emergence of layering in the shear and buoyancy fields of stratified turbulence. The goal is to use SSD to understand the mechanism by which coherent layered structures are formed, maintained and equilibrated by interaction between the incoherent turbulence and the coherent layered structures.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The SSD method constitutes a conceptual as well as methodological advance in understanding turbulence in planetary atmospheres. By directly solving the statistical equations for the turbulent state dynamics the underlying coherent structures together with their associated incoherent eddy fields are obtained explicitly allowing e.g. analytic prediction of shear and buoyancy layer formation and of the sensitivity of the layer structure and its associated turbulent fluxes to changes in system parameters. Direct solution of the SSD equations reveals that shear/buoyancy layering and the associated turbulence is supported as a novel dynamical state in which coherent layered structures interact in a synergistic manner with small-scale turbulence to produce emergent layering instabilities leading to finite amplitude coherent equilibria in the shear/buoyancy/turbulence fields. The SSD approach allows exploration of these new cooperative dynamical regimes by providing analytic and numerical methods for obtaining turbulent statistical equilibria directly from the SSD of the turbulence.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>SSD allows analytical exploration of mechanisms by which coherent components of turbulence interact with incoherent components synergistically to produce emergent dynamical phenomena.  The concepts and methods being developed are widely applicable to deepening understanding of turbulence in a wide variety of physical systems including mechanisms underlying formation and maintenance of coherent structures and regulation of turbulent transport in the atmosphere at all scales from the planetary to the boundary layer. SSD is broadly applicable to the study of a new class of emergent instabilities which are essentially related to mean flow/turbulence interaction but unrelated to laminar flow instability. Among other applications, this instability concept provides an explanation for the phenomenon of abrupt reorganization of atmospheric turbulence as a function of parameter change. Using SSD insight can be gained into the role of eddy fluxes in determining the climate response to boundary forcing (such as SST variation during ENSO events). This capability is important because the direct response to e.g. boundary condition changes can be small compared to the indirect effect brought about by subsequent changes induced in eddy statistics. SSD constitutes a general theory of turbulence in shear flow and among the broader impacts of this work are its application to turbulent phenomena in other physical contexts including plasma turbulence, the turbulence of wall-bounded shear flows and MHD turbulence. The broader impacts of this work also include support of a graduate student in atmospheric dynamics."

Data collected by the US network of weather radars and new analysis methods let us track these migrations. The Dark Ecology Project will develop new resources allowing us to estimate the densities of migrating birds as they have changed in the last 20 years. One outcome will be our better ability to monitor bird populations and their migration systems, and the impacts of various environmental factors. The US network of weather radars has recorded a comprehensive 25-year archive of images of the atmosphere, which provides the baseline information about bird movements. Extracting biological information from the images is not automated currently, making it very slow and inefficient. A team of ecologists and computer scientists will conduct novel research combining methods in computer vision and machine learning to unlock detailed information about bird migration from the entire US archive of weather radar data. The resulting dataset will be freely available, providing an information resource for researchers to estimate the number of birds migrating on any given night, measure the patterns and trends of bird populations, and do hypothesis driven science. The research will advance big data analysis and visualization techniques for large-scale science questions, and will engage scientists, conservation planners, students, and the general public with data, visualizations, and educational material about bird migration.<br/><br/>Dark Ecology will leverage large-scale cloud computing and develop novel computer vision, machine learning, and radar analysis methods to measure the densities and velocities of migrating birds across the US. Deep convolutional networks will be trained to discriminate migrating birds from precipitation and other clutter in the radar data. New techniques for domain transfer and weakly supervised training will enable the training of convolutional networks with only modest-sized training sets. Gaussian process (GP) models will be developed to create smooth national maps of migration density and velocity. Novel GP methods and cloud-computing workflows will allow us to scale to massive radar data sets and analyze the more then 200 million archived radar scans. The resulting data and tools will be curated with open access policies, and used by the research team to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of continent-scale migration.

Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to eradicate cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue as much as possible. However, if unaccounted for, internal organ motion during radiation delivery may lead to underdosing of cancer cells or overdosing of normal tissue. Organ motion is of particular concern in the treatment of lung and abdominal cancers, where breathing induces large tumor displacement and organ deformation. A recent technological innovation is a new generation of radiotherapy systems equipped with on-board magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners providing a real-time high-contrast movie of the patient's anatomy during radiation delivery. This research will develop the methods to enable use of real-time imaging to control the progress of radiation delivery in order to correct for any dose discrepancy, thus allowing treatment plans to actively adjust to anatomical changes.  If successful, the research will provide clinicians with real-time organ-motion management tools that have the potential to improve the delivery efficiency and radiation dose conformity for MRI-guided radiotherapy, leading to higher rates of disease control and fewer side effects for cancer patients, thus improving their quality of life after treatment.  The project will provide support for a graduate student who will benefit from the multi-disciplinary research environment.<br/><br/>This research employs medical-image processing techniques to infer the time-dependent state of the patient's anatomy from the stream of MRI sequences and to estimate the cumulative delivered dose in real-time. Using the inferred anatomical information, a stochastic model will be developed to project the immediate future trajectory of the anatomical motion. The cumulative dose estimation and the projected anatomical trajectory will be integrated as feedback and feed-forward control signals, respectively, into a stochastic control problem, which will be solved dynamically to (re)optimize the radiotherapy plan over the remainder of the treatment session. The control approach will be tested on clinical cancer patients previously treated with MRI-guided radiotherapy at a collaborating cancer center to quantify the anticipated improvement in plan quality and delivery efficiency. The project also provides a foundation from which to quantify the value of real-time MRI information."

The project will address theoretical debates about whether retaining autonomous control over earnings facilitates women?s ability to convert money into power within their relationships. Investigating how couples allocate money will help resolve the theoretical puzzle of why women's increased labor force participation has not been a sufficient condition to reducing gender inequality in the home. This research will add conceptual clarity to the ways gender and economic circumstances combine to structure family relations. Securing the welfare of all individuals within households is a matter of public concern and this study is expected to expand knowledge about women's economic position in society. How families share money influences relationship quality and the distribution of resources when relationships end, an event that often disproportionately disadvantages women economically. The research will contribute to our understanding of the stability of adult intimate relationships, a topic important to policy makers.<br/>Economic changes in society altered the dynamic of financial resources brought into relationships and family structures are increasingly diverse. Modern couples confront tensions between ideals of mutual family interests and values of individualism, a departure from fitting themselves into culturally expected family arrangements of the past. Interpretations of why individuals increasingly withhold money from a common family pot are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, and has generated competing claims about what the trend symbolizes: a rise in the instability of families, a shift towards individualist interests within marriages, or evidence of movement towards an ethos of gender equality. Class disparities in the risk of financial hardship may also influence the goals and resources available to families. This project uses semi-structured interviews with couples to understand how couples' allocation of money mitigates or exacerbates gender equality within families and whether the strategies used to achieve couples' goals are conditional on class position. The interviews will focus on life transitions associated with changes in financial allocations approaches and addresses the paradoxes between the stated reasoning behind couples? allocation systems and the actual consequences of their organizational approaches."

They focus on either the significance of contemporary neoliberal ideas or on policy histories. Over the last decade, Japanese and Malaysian government agencies have enacted new policing, shelter, and housing initiatives to achieve zero homelessness. This project will investigate contemporary homelessness regulation in two capital cities in the Asian region;namely, Tokyo, Japan, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It will examine how homelessness regulations are rooted in the historical development of each nation's welfare and penal systems, thereby giving attention to post/metropolitan and post/colonial contexts. The project will use a global historical lens to inform interdisciplinary literature on neoliberal governance, homelessness regulation, and legacies of imperial and colonial politico-legal cultures. <br/>By analyzing key shifts in homelessness regulation across two distinct developmental contexts in Asia, this investigation will advance understanding of the influences of particular state forms and their respective penal and welfare infrastructures with regard to homelessness management. In addition, the project will identify the influences of cross-border networks in the adoption, transformation, and exchange of globally-mobile ideas and practices relating to homelessness regulation in the Asian region. Such investigation is critical for understanding the distinct local forms of contemporary policy regimes, as well as broader cross-border innovations and inter-relations, particularly in light of shared global histories of vagrancy laws and related policy networks.<br/><br/>This project will illustrate how current trends in homelessness policy tap into historically-established institutional arrangements and their ideational underpinnings, thereby driving unique policy variations and individual street-level experiences. This project includes the use of comparative historical and ethnographic methods to examine shifts in homelessness regulation in two sites from the late-nineteenth century to the present. The investigator will identify key historical shifts in ideas and institutions underpinning contemporary organization through archival research and interviews, and trace street-level impacts of policy through archival ethnography and ethnographic fieldwork. This project, by its focus on Asian cities of varied developmental statuses, seeks to answer questions regarding historical continuities and breaks in global and local trajectories of homelessness regulation."

This major mode of Earth's climate system has historically been characterized as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation for which signatures have been identified in biological and physical indicators across Asia, Australia, and South America and even in global-scale trends in sea level and surface temperature.  However, there remains considerable and long-standing uncertainly in its behavior prior to AD 1900 and the extent to which 20th century dynamics are atypical in a multi-centennial context. <br/><br/>In this study, three paleoclimate proxy data sources will be integrated to reconstruct North Pacific decadal variability. First, a network of exactly dated chronologies will be produced from growth-increment widths of long-lived marine bivalve Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa), the growth of which is demonstrated to be highly sensitive to sea surface temperatures. Radiocarbon (14C) data in geoducks, once cross-dated and placed in the appropriate calendar years, will yield another perspective on North Pacific decadal variability with information regarding long-term changes in water mass age and coastal ocean circulation. Finally, existing tree-ring chronologies from the North Pacific rim will be integrated with the geoduck data to maximize reconstruction power and accuracy in a multi-proxy approach.<br/><br/>The broader impacts involve support for an early career scientist, grad student, and post-doc, and will involve undergraduate students in the research activities.

Exploratory behavior, however, is not optimal in all settings. For example, a hungry animal may avoid exploring a novel item when navigating toward a food source or being pursued by a predator. The perirhinal cortex, part of the medial temporal lobe memory system, is known to be important for identifying novelty. However, how do we know when it is appropriate or safe to explore a novel item or situation? Substantial evidence indicates that such cognitive control relies on the prefrontal cortex. Cells in the prefrontal as well as the perirhinal cortex respond to novelty by changing their activity levels.  The mechanisms by which these two, distant brain regions interact in novelty-guided exploration are unknown. Recent work suggests that brain regions communicate by large, low-frequency oscillations, and results from the investigator's laboratory suggest that the particular frequency of oscillation in the perirhinal cortex transmits specific abstract information about the novelty and familiarity of individual items. The present research program addresses the overarching hypothesis that this signaling mechanism between brain regions is used in perirhinal-prefrontal interactions during novelty-guided behavior in rats. The work will impact memory research, neuroscience, and the community at large in several ways. First, the studies promise to delineate the neural mechanisms and brain circuitry underlying recognition memory and novelty-guided behavior. Second, the studies advance our understanding of the role of the prefrontal cortex and of prefrontal-perirhinal interactions in novelty-guided exploration. Finally, the studies hold the promise of revealing a new category of temporal coding in which the frequency of the oscillation enhances the transmission of specific abstract information across brain regions.  In addition, the project provides opportunity for students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to engage in intensive summer research training, and for local middle and high school students to learn about neuroscience research.<br/><br/>This research project includes a series of experiments that combine electrophysiology, optogenetics, transgenic animals, and behavior to elucidate the mechanisms and circuits by which synchronous neuronal activity guides appropriate exploration of novelty and familiarity. The experiments test the hypothesis that perirhinal-prefrontal interactions are necessary for novelty-guided exploration and modulated by synchronous neuronal activity in specific frequency bands. In vivo experiments employ multiple measures of rhythmic, synchronous activity to understand the temporal codes relaying information within and between the brain regions as a function of behavior, e.g., changes in local field potential (LFP) power in a given region at particular frequencies, changes in LFP coherence between any given pair of regions at particular frequencies, and phase-locking of cells in one region to the LFP in the same region or in other regions. Complimentary in vitro experiments employ state-of the-art optogenetic tools to interrogate the cellular mechanisms that underlie synchronous activity, focusing in particular on the differential roles of interneurons and pyramidal cells. The results from this work advances our understanding of the underlying circuitry of novelty-guided behavior and cognition, as well as of how brain oscillations modulate cognitive processes."

Understanding grammatical structure is a central part of understanding human language, and linguistic knowledge is increasingly seen as part of the core knowledge students should acquire as part of their education at the primary, secondary, and higher education levels. The workshop will educate junior scientists and teachers, improving grammar pedagogy, and increasing dialogue about connections between linguistic research and teaching. Furthering linguistic knowledge on the part of the public is additionally important for addressing linguistic prejudice that exists in society; the workshop will include discussion of how dialect variation can be incorporated into grammar courses, as a way of improving understanding about language as one dimension of social diversity. By facilitating collaborative dialogue about the links between linguistic research on grammar and grammar pedagogy, the workshop will simultaneously contribute to linguistics research and teaching concerns. Ultimately, the event will develop an agenda for making grammar pedagogy a more systematic concern, as part of a larger project of increasing attention to the scholarship of teaching and learning in linguistics. <br/><br/>Five invited speakers, all respected scholars and experienced teachers of grammar and related subjects, will address themes related to the teaching and learning of grammar: Attitudes, Goals, Frameworks, or First- Versus Second-Language Study.

Amidst a litany of crises confronting the American medical profession at the turn of the 21st century (from patient satisfaction to widespread health and health care disparities to complex health care systems), the leaders of the medical profession made the education objective of 'understanding people' a national priority for medical education. Such a move entails an integration of humanistic and social scientific knowledge into what traditionally is a biomedical learning and work environment. <br/>This project will enhance the basic theoretical and practical understanding of how humanistic and social scientific knowledge is produced, evaluated, and applied, identifying the institutional features of universities that encourage productive relationships between the liberal and practical arts. This project will be both a platform for increasing each university's institutional capacity for diversity and inclusion, as well as a springboard for university-based educational programs to evaluate various initiatives pitched to improve patient care. In addition, this project will contribute to the improvement of STEM education and educator development, by revealing how medical educators collaborate across epistemological and methodological divides toward achieving their goals. Finally, by better understanding the challenges that beset interdisciplinary collaboration between the liberal and practical arts, universities will be able to establish more empirically-informed programming that traditional and interdisciplinary programs can implement. <br/><br/>The idea that scientific knowledge should be used to improve society has long underwritten the organization of academic knowledge production and evaluation. The cultural value of applying scientific knowledge to solve social problems has recently been supplemented by the promise of interdisciplinary collaboration. With diverse disciplinary perspectives concentrated on a single social problem, the logic goes, the better the solution. Despite the prevalence of humanistic and social scientific knowledge becoming increasingly called upon to contribute in applied and interdisciplinary ways, there is a remarkable lack of understanding about how scholars successfully apply these forms of knowledge in interdisciplinary contexts. This project takes up that task by examining how humanistic and social scientific knowledge is successfully integrated with biomedical knowledge into medical education, paying close attention to how scholars with different epistemological and methodological commitments construct how humanistic and social scientific knowledge is 'relevant' for medical practice and how scholars negotiate these differences while engaging in interdisciplinary collaboration. To answer these questions, this project uses in-depth, semi-structured interviews with humanities scholars, social science scholars, medical educators, and medical students; historical data from professional and legislative decisions, curricular materials, and publications; and non-participant observation at scientific meetings."

Problems where the timing of activities plays a critical role are pervasive. Such problems arise in diverse applications, such as scheduling surgical facilities, electric power generation, design and operation of military air- and sea-lift networks for national defense, and in same-day and next-hour delivery of online orders.  This project addresses fundamental research leading to computational methods to solve challenging optimization problems that underly these operations.  Improved design and operation of these systems is expected to result in significant socioeconomic benefits.   The research findings will be incorporated into existing undergraduate and graduate courses in optimization, logistics, and supply chain management.<br/><br/>This project will advance the fundamental understanding of time dependent integer programming (IP) problems.  By developing dynamic discretization methods that can discover exactly which times are needed to obtain an optimal solution, in an efficient way, the resulting IPs become computationally tractable.  The research will involve a priori partial discretization approaches, which divide the planning horizon into time intervals, and base model variables for placement of activities in these intervals.  The methods will embed three key components: (i) extended, discrete time, IP models, based on a partial discretization of time, i.e., using only a subset of the possible time points, whose solution yields a dual bound on the value of the original problem; (ii) a ""repair"" mechanism for the solution to the dual bound IP, or a different extended IP model based on the partial discretization, to obtain feasible solutions to the original problem; and (iii) a refinement technique, that identifies time points to add to the partial discretization, so as to improve the dual bound.  Theoretical bounds and quantifiable approximation errors in terms of discretization granularity will be studied."

In many frontier regions, violent land conflicts often pit indigenous people against non-indigenous farmers who are newly arrived at the frontier. These migrants are often landless and have been displaced from other settings. They are also commonly blamed for land conflicts, and accused of invading indigenous lands and destroying forests. Most efforts to solve land conflicts recommend the expulsion of migrants, especially when they are settling on indigenous land. This research focuses on migrant expulsion and other policies of spatial exclusion to explore the degree to which, in their conceptualization and practice, they ""blame the victim"". The research posits that such strategies obscure the ability to address the broader political-economic processes that contributed to displacement and migration of non-indigenous people to indigenous territories in the first place. The researchers will test the idea that such policies are likely to do more harm than good by not addressing these broader issues. Such research is vital, because migrant expulsion policies, while still relatively new, are being considered by multiple countries as a means of adjudicating land disputes in land- and resource-rich frontiers. This research thus aims to make a direct contribution to the high-stakes debate on the feasibility of such policies.  At the local level, the researchers cooperate closely with local universities to contribute to institution-building and academic training. Moreover, collaboration with indigenous and non-indigenous communities at all stages of the research process ensures that their data and research needs are incorporated into the research design. The project provides support to a PhD student to complete dissertation research.<br/><br/>The research is novel in highlighting the viewpoints of non-indigenous migrants. The work is grounded in literatures in political ecology and cultural politics and draws on critical race theory in new ways. Migrant expulsion is conceptualized as an instance of difference-making, resulting from the dominance of neoliberal modes of governance and market-based approaches to environmental conservation. It ignores the often shared experiences of marginalization and dispossession and the multiple identities within the non-indigenous group. The researchers suggest that challenging these facile categorizations requires attention to how local people articulate and negotiate their identities in relation to land. Toward this end, building on prior interviews with policy makers and ongoing analysis of census data, the co-PI will analyze territorial conflicts and their possible solutions through oral histories, group interviews, and a household survey with non-indigenous and indigenous Mayangna communities on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast. The multiple methods are designed to answer the core questions: 1) What conditions and motivations propel non-indigenous migration to indigenous territories? 2) How are rights to land understood, and how are they constructed through specific forms of ethnic ascription? 3) How are migrant expulsion and other exclusionary policies perceived on the ground?"

But too often methods that work on standardized collections for expert users don't translate to real-world data analysis. In order to be useful, text mining methodologies need to balance theoretical power with practical application. Real data sets are noisy and complicated. More importantly, vast amounts of data cannot be shared directly due to copyright, including all published books after 1923. This project will develop tools that can be applied to limited, privatized views of documents. Algorithms will focus on reliability and efficiency, so that powerful techniques can be used by non-expert users on easily accessible hardware, such as the 10 million K-12 students using low-powered browser-based Chromebooks thereby increasing the societal impact of the work.<br/><br/>Unsupervised text mining methods such as topic models and word embeddings have become popular outside of machine learning because they operate on simple, widely-available representations and identify latent variables that represent recognizable themes, events, or concepts. But standard algorithms do not scale well, require full access to potentially sensitive text collections, and cannot take advantage of non-textual data such as images. Although recent work in spectral inference has produced improvements in speed, current methods are plagued by sensitivity to noisy observations. This work will develop a unified approach to unsupervised text mining based on matrix and tensor factorization. The project will focus on data rectification methods for input matrices, enabling simple algorithms to work dramatically better, even in the presence of sparse and noisy observations, while also reducing model uncertainty. The project will develop new methods for learning from private and sensitive documents by creating public views of non-public data. These will include both noisy representations of individual documents as well as corpus-level summary matrices, and support both strong non-identifiability and weaker non-expressivity criteria. Finally, the project will develop new tools for modeling images and text optimized for the way images actually accompany text in real corpora, rather than short, artificial captions. By jointly modeling large volumes of text and semantically related images, the project will enable users to search for contextually related images, not just visually similar images, and identify topics that are grounded in the visual world, not just in text.

The Southern Ocean is also unique because it encircles the globe, providing pathways for deep, inter-basin exchange. Previous studies have shown that particulate organic carbon (POC; fixed organic matter) seasonally builds up around the productive Antarctic seas before moving off-shore.  The project will serve as a step toward better quantifying the export of POC from around the Antarctic Peninsula and better understanding the larger Southern Ocean carbon cycle. The project will promote education by supporting graduate and  undergraduate students. New data sets on offshore transport pathways and POC variability will be generated in a consistent and systematic manner, and will be available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This proposal will examine the offshore export of particulate organic carbon (POC) off the Antarctic Peninsula, from areas of high accumulation near the coast to areas offshore.  We hypothesize that both wind-driven surface Ekman transport and transport by nonlinear mesoscale eddies can make significant contributions to the offshore export of POC. Specifically, the project will (1) identify areas of enhanced accumulation of POC off the Antarctic Peninsula; (2) quantify spatial and temporal variability in offshore transport by nonlinear mesoscale eddies and by winds in a surface Ekman layer; and (3) compare the estimates of offshore transport to the POC distribution away from the coast to identify preferred transport pathways or hotspots for offshore export of coastal water and POC off the Peninsula. This study will utilize decade-long satellite observations of POC based on algorithms validated against in situ data, ocean vector winds, eddy kinematic and propagation characteristics based on altimeter data, and results from a high resolution eddy resolving ocean model coupled to a sea ice model. The study will focus on the Antarctic Peninsula during summer, when reduced cloud/sea ice cover when satellite data availability is high."

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.<br/><br/>This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

Previous archaeological research indicates that hunter-gatherers often broaden their diets to include previously ignored animal resources due to changes in environmental conditions, increases in human population densities or both. In some cases, these activities lead to increased human-animal interaction and eventually domestication, while in others they facilitate the continued long-term exploitation of wild animals by hunter-gatherer groups. Given the documented changes to human societies that follow domestication, research on the archaeological record of hunter-gatherers who lived through the transition to agriculture provides a means to examine how and why these shifts occurred, as well as providing information on how hunter-gatherer populations impacted the adoption of domesticated animals and plants in a region where they continue to forage alongside agriculturalists today. In a globalized world with complex indigenous rights issues as well as a loss of traditional knowledge and subsistence practices, this project will examine how long-term archaeological record of hunting and animal exploitation articulates with modern hunter-gatherer lifeways and wild animal conservation issues.   <br/><br/>In this project, Conrad will test the ""Broad Spectrum Revolution"" hypothesis at a suite of sites from northern Thailand, a region in which this hypothesis has never been formally tested. Northern Thailand was 1) the first region in Thailand where these domesticates were introduced and 2) a region where the extant wild progenitors of these domesticated animals originally lived and were (and continue to be) exploited by hunter-gatherers. Using both analysis of animal bone from these sites and biochemical testing of animal teeth and mollusk shell, Conrad will explore how hunter-gatherers altered (or not) their exploitation of wild animals in response to changes in environmental conditions and to the introduction of domesticated plants and animals. This multi-faceted approach will provide fine-grained data on wild animal hunting before, during, and after the period when domestic plants and animals were first introduced. The data produced by this project will be an important proxy for understanding how future environmental changes in the Southeast Asian tropics may impact traditional subsistence strategies and domesticated animal husbandry. In addition, this project will support professional collaborations between American and Thai scholars and will result in the creation of a bilingual museum exhibit presenting project results at the Natural History Museum of the National Science Museum, Thailand."

Two common environmental stressors of plants are flooding and drought. Successful completion of the proposed objectives will validate the function of novel genes and associated pathways that that allow the plant to live through periods of prolonged flooding, and paradoxically, also allow plants to survive drought conditions. The researchers and their colleagues have discovered that, while most types of rice die after three days of complete submergence during flooding, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) gene can tolerate this stress, and live through severe flooding events.  This project will explore how the SUB1 gene, and the genes that it interacts with, are able to promote tolerance to flooding and to drought.  The proposed experiments are also expected to lead to important new insights into plant biology with applications to agricultural productivity in one of the world's most important crops. The lead researcher, Ronald, serves as the faculty director of the UC Davis World Food Center's Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy, where she will continue her work to engage the public on issues related to plant genetics and the science and technology of food production. Students at levels from high school interns to postdoctoral fellows, will be involved in carrying out the work and in outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Whereas most rice plants die after three days of complete submergence, those carrying the Submergence tolerance 1 (SUB1) locus are tolerant. The Ronald laboratory and collaborators demonstrated that the rice SUB1 locus encodes three Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators, SUB1A, SUB1B, and SUB1C and that overexpression of the SUB1A is sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant rice varieties. The SUB1 locus has also been shown to promote plant survival during drought. The Ronald lab further demonstrated that an uncharacterized member of the OsGTgamma-2 family of GT factors, a novel SANT domain-containing protein called SAB18, (SUB1A BINDING PROTEIN 18), binds SUB1A in yeast. SAB18 overexpression confers SUB1A-dependent enhanced submergence tolerance and remarkably robust drought tolerance. Furthermore SUB1/SAB18ox plants display a reduction of leaf water loss and lipid peroxidation indicating that SAB18 enhances oxidative stress tolerance. The Ronald lab also isolated three fast neutron (FN)-irradiated mutants that serve as SUPPRESSORS OF STRESS TOLERANCE MEDIATED BY SUB1 (sst). The researchers hypothesize that SAB18 positively regulates SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance by forming a protein complex with SUB1A, which binds and activates the promoters of SUB1A, SAB18 and/or genes conferring stress tolerance. It is further hypothesized that the genes encoded by the sst locus are required for these activities. To test these models the researchers propose to: 1) Identify genes and pathways regulated by SAB18. 2) Determine the mechanism of action of SAB18/SUB1A-mediated stress tolerance. 3) Characterize three sst mutants and identify the genes corresponding to the mutations using a whole genome resequencing approach."

In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings.  Additionally we plan to video and live stream the invited talks. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.<br/> <br/>This year the conference will focus on five research themes in the topology plus model: topology + algebra and analysis, topology + asymmetric structures, topology + dynamics and continuum theory, topology + foundations, and topology + geometry.  There will be a workshop on monotone covering properties, and one on entropy in topological groups.  These fields were chosen to be representative of the broad range of research being actively pursued today.  The conference structure will promote  interaction between these diverse fields by having one plenary talk in each field, providing workshops where interested parties can learn about new fields, and by providing dedicated collaboration space and social space where researchers can discuss problems informally.  The conference will invite one plenary speaker from each of these fields along with the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner.  For more information see https://go.udayton.edu/sumtopo2017."

These organizations provide critical resources to seek social change, help construct political identities, and spur civic engagement. The attention of the mass news media is critical to these organizations.  News coverage shows that these organizations are being treated as legitimate spokespersons and helps them influence public opinion and policy agendas.  This project augments a previous collection of approximately one million articles published in the twentieth century in four national newspapers--the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times. This project will capture data in all 18 newspapers available through ProQuest Historical Newspapers, including a wealth of regional and African-American newspapers, and will extend these data through the first 15 years of this century. The project will also gather more extensive information about the articles, coverage data on major interest groups, and organizational data on the advocacy and movement organizations in the sample. These data will be supplemented with television news and social media data. In addition to creating this valuable data set, the key merits of the project include the addressing of several research questions regarding the causes of the amount and quality of coverage of movements and their organizations. The project will also result in the training of graduate students and produce several scholarly articles that identify and explain movement coverage and its consequences, and a scholarly monograph. <br/><br/>The project addresses several key empirical and ""why"" questions about these organizations? news coverage: Which organizations and allied movements have received the greatest newspaper and TV coverage?  Which organizations have received the greatest attention in their movements? How has the coverage changed over time and across movements?  Are coverage patterns similar across national, regional, and African-American newspapers? Do movements usually gain substantive coverage in articles in which they are mentioned?  What accounts for extensive newspaper coverage of a movement and its activities?  What accounts for extensive newspaper coverage for individual organizations within a movement?  Are the patterns of coverage consistent with the main theories of social movements?resource mobilization, new social movement, grievance, and political process and political reform theories?   How has the connection between newspaper coverage and movement activity changed with the decline of newspapers and the rise of the Internet and social media? Under which conditions do movement actors receive substantive news coverage?  The project will address these questions by synthesizing negative binomial regression analyses on counts data and qualitative methods, notably fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analyses and comparative historical analyses.  The analyses combine big-data gathering with qualitative coding of newspapers.  Unlike most large-N work, the project can return to the original data, the newspaper articles, to refine hypotheses and build theory."

Certain types of bacteria are able to capture N from the atmosphere and make it available for plants through the process of N-fixation. Other bacterial groups use their metabolism to return N to the atmosphere.  Plant roots and fungi in soil can influence bacteria, but the effect of these interactions on N cycling is unclear. The aims of this project are to (1) characterize relationships between N-cycle reactions and different groups of bacteria, and (2) to explore how these relationships are influenced by plant roots and fungi. Understanding how factors in soil control N-availability for plants is important for agriculture and forestry. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant project will enhance the graduate student's dissertation research, provide opportunities for undergraduate students to develop field and laboratory techniques in biogeochemistry, and will be integrated in outreach activities organized through the Boston University Biogeoscience program.<br/> <br/>Plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi can influence the form and availability of inorganic N in soil, potentially impacting the composition and activity of N-cycling bacterial functional groups. This research will test three hypotheses: (1) enhanced competition for N between plants and soil microbes in forest stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi relative to stands dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi will select for N-fixers and select against nitrifiers and denitrifiers; (2) high plant demand for inorganic N in rhizosphere soils relative to bulk soils will select for diazotrophs and select against nitrifiers and denitrifiers; and (3) the magnitude of the rhizosphere effect will increase as ECM abundance increases. To test these hypotheses, the abundance of gene copies (DNA) and gene transcripts (RNA) associated with N-fixers, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers will be quantified in rhizosphere soil samples across a mycorrhizal gradient established at the Harvard Forest LTER site in Petersham, MA. Stable isotope approaches will be used to measure rates of N-fixation, nitrification and denitrification. These paired analyses will elucidate relationships between microbial community composition and function and identify how these relationships vary based on biotic interactions between N-cycling bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots."

Communicative competence---knowing what to say, when to say it and how to say it--- is one of the primary challenges that foreign language students struggle to achieve. Second language research reveals that foreign language students are less likely to communicate verbally in the classroom setting when they lack confidence in their ability to carry a conversation with native speakers. This project develops language learning technology that provides scaffolded opportunities for second language students to acquire vocabulary words and conversational phrases while simultaneously developing listening comprehension skills and speaking capabilities in the targeted language.

Speech-based interactions with game characters will enable second language students to increase their vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension skills and speaking capabilities in the targeted language, Spanish. Results of this research will inform the design of more sophisticated language learning technology that facilitates communicative competence in any foreign language.<br/><br/>This research program seeks to iteratively design computer generated conversational game characters known as Non Player Characters (NPCs) that engage foreign language students in social interactions that facilitate second language acquisition in Spanish.  Research questions include: How do we strategically design conversational NPCs to scaffold novices' proficiency in the targeted language? How do novices' proficiency change over time as a result of social interactions with conversational NPCs during gameplay? What do these in-game social interactions suggest about creating meaningful gameplay experiences that improve novices' proficiency in the targeted language? The results of this exploratory research will inform a new genre of language learning technology specifically designed to increase foreign language students' proficiency in the targeted language as a supplement to traditional classroom instruction. The project will involve developing and evaluating the efficacy of the Game-based Social Interaction Model (GSIM), a conceptual framework that links in-game social interactions between native and non-native speakers to successful vocabulary acquisition in the targeted language. The GSIM will motivate the NPCs' verbal behaviors during gameplay, enabling the NPCs to emulate human-like interactions that facilitate novices' proficiency in the targeted language. In the context of a mobile game, the project will iteratively design conversational NPCs to provide scaffolded opportunities for second language students to increase their vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension and speaking capabilities in the targeted language.

Despite a more than two-hundred-year Black presence in Appalachia, the perceived racial homogeneity of the region and the scholarly discourse that downplay racial difference create a story of Appalachia focused on poor (White) problems that ignore race. Through a qualitative case study of Knoxville, this dissertation seeks to disrupt popular and scholarly conceptions of Appalachia by considering how scholars might research, recognize and think about race in the region not simply through the experiences of Whites, but through an examination of the lives of the sizable but almost invisible population of Blacks. US Black identity research has overwhelmingly focused on Great Migration destinations such as Philadelphia and, recently, Southern cities like Atlanta. This research adds sociological nuance and expands the understanding of Black regional identity by focusing on a region where Black identity is shaped by neglect. The researcher will integrate and expand upon Black identity research theoretically attached to regionalization and inter-sectionality in Appalachia and that class, gender and generation compound these distinctions. This research not only gives voice to a Black Appalachian community but it also raises awareness of the issues that may affect Black communities throughout Appalachia. <br/><br/>There has long been a substantial number of Blacks particularly in urban areas in Southern Appalachia, such as Knoxville, Tennessee. Knoxville presents an ideal city to conduct a case study of African American experiences and identity in Appalachia given the number of African Americans who call Knoxville home and the historical significance of the city for African Americans in the region. Three primary questions drive this research. The first research question (what are the dimensions of Black identity in Appalachia) is interested in everyday Black life and experiences in Knoxville. The researcher will examine how Black identities are constructed, maintained, and contested in particular spaces in Knoxville. The second research question asks how other identities, such as class, gender, and generation shape Blackness. This question is concerned with the intersections of identity categories and how a person's experiences might differ depending on the intersections of their identity. The third question asks what are the historical, structural, racial and cultural practices that result in Black invisibility? This question seeks to understand the structuring factors that have organized Black lives in Knoxville historically, and how race and racism have impacted blacks in the region generally. To answer these question this research will employ qualitative and archival research methods. The researcher will conduct approximately 50 semi-structured interviews with a diverse cross-section of African Americans in Knoxville including men and women of different socio-economic backgrounds, neighborhoods of residence and age ranges. The researcher will use purposeful and snowball sampling to recruit participants of the three geographic spaces that have historically been associated with African Americans in Knoxville, East Knoxville, Mechanicsville and Lonsdale, as well as from other areas. The researcher will also review newspaper articles, major studies of Appalachia communities, and government documents to examine how cultural, geographical, and social narratives of Appalachia and Blacks in the region have been constructed historically."

Progress on electronic device miniaturization has culminated in the ability of modern technology to confine electrons at the nanoscale. Such confinement results in drastically changed material properties. A striking example is the fractional quantum Hall effect, where electrons behave as if they were split into several smaller particles, called anyons. The properties of anyons are unlike those of any other particles in nature, and can be used for potential applications in topological quantum computing, which is uniquely free of errors that are inherent in all other approaches to quantum computing. As a consequence, a topological quantum computer could accomplish the same tasks as a much larger non-topological quantum computer but with fewer qubits. <br/><br/>The project aims at understanding the properties of anyons, which is a critical open problem. The PI will collaborate closely with experimental groups, and incorporate research insights from the field of topological insulators. Topological insulators are new materials that do not conduct electricity in the bulk like their conventional relatives rubber and plastic. However, in contrast to rubber and plastic, their surface forms a conductor. The PI will investigate the flow of electric current on the surfaces of topological insulators in the presence of material disorder.<br/> <br/>In addition to research, the award supports several educational and outreach activities. Most of the budget will be directed towards supporting graduate students. Other activities will involve advising undergraduate students, performing outreach at different school grade levels, and organizing a scientific conference. Graduate and undergraduate research on novel materials will contribute to the scientific education of the US workforce.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research and education on the theory of topological quantum materials. The properties of topological materials are dramatically different from others, particularly in the presence of strong interactions, or quenched disorder. For example, Coulomb interaction leads to the formation of fractional quantum Hall states, where electrons fractionalize into anyons, a theoretical prediction that opens up possibilities of great importance for basic research and applications, and that has stimulated much experimental work. <br/><br/>The first thrust of this project is motivated in part by recent experiments and focuses on the nature of the fractional quantum Hall states in the second Landau level in GaAs systems. The other motivation of the first thrust comes from the recent breakthrough work that connected theoretical ideas about surface states of topological insulators with 2D electron gases at half-filling. The project explores related physics in the absence of particle-hole symmetry at filling factor 5/2, and uses it to explain experimental data. The research addresses the effect of strong interactions on the existing experimental tools, and in collaboration with experimentalists' aims at developing new approaches to probing anyons.<br/><br/>Topological properties are robust with respect to weak quenched disorder, but strong disorder may lead to striking effects, such as the formation of a metallic phase in 3D topological insulators. The second thrust of the project investigates the physics of that unusual metal. The project explores the crossover between bulk and surface disorder by considering insulators with fractal surfaces, as well as transport in low-dimensional structures based on topological insulators.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the award supports several educational and outreach activities. Most of the budget will be directed towards supporting graduate students. Other activities will involve advising undergraduate students, performing outreach at different school grade levels, and organizing a scientific conference. Graduate and undergraduate research on novel materials will contribute to the scientific education of the US workforce."

The most persistent manifestation of this history is the racial achievement gap. This project will address the racial achievement gap from the vantage point of black students in racially segregated, high-poverty schools. More specifically, this study examines how trust shapes the quality of their relationships with teachers and their educational outcomes. This research is guided by the premise that trust can be a lever for improving the schooling experiences and academic performance of disadvantaged students. Prior studies demonstrate that trust is a salient component of effective and cohesive school communities. However, much of the existing research on this topic fails to consider trust from the perspective of students. Trust should be a topic of concern for researchers interested in racial inequality in education and youth inequality more broadly, since research suggests that pervasive feelings of distrust can cement disadvantage initiated by larger meso-and marco-level forces. Recognizing the power of trust in shaping one?s life chances, a study of black young people's propensity to trust their teachers (i.e., student?teacher trust) is warranted as a potentially significant determinant of their educational outcomes and future well-being.<br/><br/>The aims of this dissertation are threefold. First, this work sets out to investigate the academic consequences of trust both for individual students and schools. Second, this work will examine the causes of students' (dis)trust in their teachers and reveal the mechanisms linking trust to student achievement. Finally, by focusing on youth, this study will advance the social science literature on trust, which to date has been preoccupied with the adult experience. To address these aims, this mixed-method study will proceed in two phases. Phase one entails a quantitative analysis of survey and administrative data on New York City (NYC) public schools. This analysis will illuminate the relationship between student?teacher trust and achievement at the school-level and will identify comparative case study schools for phase two of the study. Phase two entails semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 48 students and 20 educators across four NYC public high schools. These interviews will permit an examination of trust on the interpersonal level. While this study is centered on the student-teacher relationship, it will provide insight into processes of youth trust and inequality that can be applied to other institutional settings (e.g., the justice system). Study findings will also highlight how educators and other authority figures can harness trust as a tool for better engaging youth on the social margins."

The principle investigator and team of undergraduate students will investigate the structure of light neutron-rich atomic nuclei that do not exist naturally in nature but must be produced at an accelerator facility.  Understanding these nuclei is important for advancing our understanding of how the protons and the neutrons bind together in nuclear systems that are very near the limits of existence.  As the research program advances to the study of heavier nuclei, results will provide important information for the understanding of explosive astrophysical environments such as supernovae and neutron star mergers.  Much of the research will be conducted at Westmont College, which includes student training in and the use of instrumentation and data analysis techniques, and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, where students participate in state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments.  Major instrumentation used in experiments include the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), both constructed and tested by undergraduate students from several institutions in the MoNA collaboration.  In addition to the science goals, an important goal of this program is to provide transformational research experiences for the participating undergraduate students that can have a positive influence on decisions they make for future study and careers in physics.  <br/><br/>The research supported by this award addresses directly some of the main questions driving the field of nuclear science today.

In pursuing this study, the following questions will be answered: What are the social and linguistic constraints on the use of 'ain't' within the speech community? What linguistic knowledge about 'ain't' do individual speakers at different points in the change have? How does the morphological form of verbs following 'ain't' interact with tense-aspect meaning for different speakers and at different times during the change?<br/><br/>Data for the project comes from two sources: (1) A corpus of casual conversations with more than 60 African American speakers collected in Philadelphia in the early 1980s by a community insider; and (2) Contemporary elicitation with native speakers of Philadelphia AAE to understand the interaction between tense-aspect meaning and verbal morphology. The results will demonstrate the social and linguistic profile of the change as well as provide a syntactic analysis of 'ain't' in AAE and an account of both variation with 'ain't' and variation in verbal morphology following 'ain't'. This research not only contributes to our understanding of morphosyntactic variation and how it interacts with speakers, mental representations of grammar, it also provides insight into the underlying structure of AAE, how it is similar to and different from other varieties of English, and how speakers of AAE navigate such differences."

This project, PATHWAYS, will address this need and provide undergraduate students from teacher preparation programs with a structured experience in which they teach small groups of children and explore the impact of their instruction on the children's mathematical learning. The undergraduate students will benefit from intensive, systematic reflection on their instructional practices, and the children involved will benefit from the opportunity to participate in lessons that transcend the boundaries of conventional mathematics instruction in the United States.  <br/><br/>Salisbury University will host eight undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summer to do mathematics education research regarding how students effectively learn mathematics in the K-12 setting. The overarching goals of PATHWAYS are to help undergraduate students develop formative assessment techniques vital to becoming accomplished teachers and to motivate graduate study in mathematics education. Undergraduate students will work in pairs, mentored by faculty, and each pair will pose mathematics tasks to groups of four children during weekly instructional sessions. The sessions will be video recorded and children's written work will be retained. Each undergraduate pair will collaboratively analyze data from each session. Each week's data analysis will determine the mathematical learning goals and instructional methods for the next week. Undergraduate students will submit weekly reports describing children's learning and cumulative case study reports describing the path of the children's learning under the instructional sequences they designed. PATHWAYS will provide a model of how undergraduate research can help develop the human resources needed to support the conduct of mathematics education research. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project is funded by NSF's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) and EHR Core Research (ECR) programs in recognition of its alignment with the teacher preparation goals of the Noyce program and the fundamental research goals of the ECR program."

These organizations provide critical resources to seek social change, help construct political identities, and spur civic engagement. The attention of the mass news media is critical to these organizations.  News coverage shows that these organizations are being treated as legitimate spokespersons and helps them influence public opinion and policy agendas.  This project augments a previous collection of approximately one million articles published in the twentieth century in four national newspapers--the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Los Angeles Times. This project will capture data in all 18 newspapers available through ProQuest Historical Newspapers, including a wealth of regional and African-American newspapers, and will extend these data through the first 15 years of this century. The project will also gather more extensive information about the articles, coverage data on major interest groups, and organizational data on the advocacy and movement organizations in the sample. These data will be supplemented with television news and social media data. In addition to creating this valuable data set, the key merits of the project include the addressing of several research questions regarding the causes of the amount and quality of coverage of movements and their organizations. The project will also result in the training of graduate students and produce several scholarly articles that identify and explain movement coverage and its consequences, and a scholarly monograph. <br/><br/>The project addresses several key empirical and ""why"" questions about these organizations? news coverage: Which organizations and allied movements have received the greatest newspaper and TV coverage?  Which organizations have received the greatest attention in their movements? How has the coverage changed over time and across movements?  Are coverage patterns similar across national, regional, and African-American newspapers? Do movements usually gain substantive coverage in articles in which they are mentioned?  What accounts for extensive newspaper coverage of a movement and its activities?  What accounts for extensive newspaper coverage for individual organizations within a movement?  Are the patterns of coverage consistent with the main theories of social movements?resource mobilization, new social movement, grievance, and political process and political reform theories?   How has the connection between newspaper coverage and movement activity changed with the decline of newspapers and the rise of the Internet and social media? Under which conditions do movement actors receive substantive news coverage?  The project will address these questions by synthesizing negative binomial regression analyses on counts data and qualitative methods, notably fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analyses and comparative historical analyses.  The analyses combine big-data gathering with qualitative coding of newspapers.  Unlike most large-N work, the project can return to the original data, the newspaper articles, to refine hypotheses and build theory."

As much as ten million cubic kilometers of basalt may have erupted in just a few hundred thousand years, and the magma may have triggered the rupture of the continent. Geologists define these areas of massive eruptions as Large Igneous Provinces.  The Ethiopian Plateau is an example of a younger volcanic province, while the Palisades on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Manhattan is part of a of a 200-million-year-old volcanic province that stretches from Newfoundland to Brazil.  In recent years, scientists have collected data that provide evidence of thick piles of lavas buried just offshore of most rifted continental margins, and as much lava may be offshore as what is estimated from mapping on land.  This project is focused on using numerical models to simulate and understand the way magma intrusion and extrusion influence the breakup of continents and the structure of the resulting continental edges. There is growing interest in how these types of magmatic processes affect the generation and preservation of hydrocarbons. The project supports the training of a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student.<br/><br/>The thick sequences of volcanic flows found offshore of most rifted margins, termed Seaward Dipping Reflectors (SDRs), are a defining feature of volcanic margins. However, the formation of these features and the potential contribution of mantle plumes as a source of the lavas that form SDRs remain a topic of controversy.  This project considers the large-scale question of whether plumes are consistent with volcanic rift propagation. Observations suggesting that rifts propagate from the distal end of rifts to the central, plume-affected areas has called into question the idea that plumes are needed to initiate volcanic rifts such as those that produced most of the Atlantic margins.  The primary hypothesis of this project is that a rapidly evolving pattern of volcanism along a rift can reconcile the plume concept and the observed rift propagation directions.  Testing this hypothesis requires consideration of how volcanism is fed along a several thousand kilometer-long volcanic rift. This study uses moderately low-resolution 3-D models of mantle flow and melting to consider how plume material might spread along an incipient rift.  The second, and main, component of the study focuses on 2-D cross-sectional models of magmatic rift development. The effect of magma intrusion and volcanism on rift formation and particularly on the development and the rapid subsidence of SDRs will be assessed. Preliminary models produce fast subsidence after SDR formation if the lower crust can flow into a region of stretching crust.  The new models will allow quantitative testing of previous conceptual models, particularly those involving lateral variability in the thermal and density structure of an evolving rift during SDR formation."

Developable mechanisms are envisioned as next-generation mechanical systems to meet these needs. A developable surface can be thought of as a shape that can be made from a thin sheet of material without breaking or stretching. The term ""developable mechanism"" is coined to describe a mechanism that conforms to or is created from a developable surface. Developable mechanisms can be used in applications as diverse as spacecraft, automobiles, ships, architecture, furniture, clothing construction, and medical devices. They can also conform to or emerge from developable surfaces such as aircraft fuselages and wings, submarine hulls, rocket cones, and minimally invasive surgery tools. They make possible new mechanisms in highly constrained spaces (such as medical implants, next generation electronics equipment, and deployable aerospace components), and applications with limited manufacturing processes available (such as high-volume production and cost-sensitive applications). Results from this research will enable engineers to meet future and presently-unfulfilled needs for hyper-compact mechanisms in several important application areas. This will be demonstrated on industry applications. Although their motion is mathematically complex, developable mechanism fabrication is increasingly possible and accessible using 3-D printers and computer-controlled tools common to maker spaces. This accessibility, combined with plans to distribute open-source design materials, will make the research results useful to a broad community. <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to advance understanding of developable mechanism fundamentals and use this knowledge to create methods for their analysis and design. This will include a thorough investigation of the properties, motion criteria and kinematics of developable mechanisms on fundamental developable surfaces, such as generalized cylinders, planes, cones, and tangent developable, and extensions to hybrid developable surfaces.

At over $1.3 trillion, rising total US student loan debt has sparked public concern, yet the experience of student borrowers is poorly understood. Research has shown that debt-based financial aid affects college access and college completion, but few studies have examined how college students understand their loan use in relation to the college experience, aspirational goals, and their plans for the future. The project will expand knowledge about how students make decisions as they navigate financial markets and financial risk in order to meet their social mobility and/or lifestyle goals. Knowledge generated by this project will be of value to US policymakers, stakeholders, and members of the public who seek, or support, efficient and fair means of providing access to higher education. <br/>	To achieve its research objectives, the project employs a mixed-method longitudinal design. Phase 1 surveys registered seniors (N=975) at a public flagship university and collects in-depth interviews with a strategic subsample of survey participants (N=111). The main objective of this phase is to assess: 1) student perceptions of the risk and social legitimacy of borrowing to pay for a college degree; 2) how pathways taken through college?including choice of major, lifestyle and consumption habits?are framed in relation to means of paying for it; and 3) the role a debt-financed college degree plays in how students imagine their futures unfolding. Phase 2 of the project will revisit the original interviewees for a second interview approximately 15-18 months after the students have graduated. The objective of Phase 2 is to address how orientations to debt affect life strategies after graduation, such as where to live, what jobs to take, and how to manage future financial risk. Phase 2 will also be used to compare how student views of their futures change after graduation.  Combined, the two phases of research will contribute to public and scholarly debate about the ethics and implications of financing higher education with student loans."

The Center is a large consortium of institutions with a national, and increasingly worldwide, distribution. Currently, over 1000 earthquake professionals are participating in SCEC projects. This research program is investigator-driven and supports core research and education in seismology, tectonic geodesy, earthquake geology, and computational science. The SCEC community advances earthquake system science by gathering information from seismic and geodetic sensors, geologic field observations, and laboratory experiments; synthesizing knowledge of earthquake phenomena through system-level, physics-based modeling; and communicating understanding of seismic hazards to reduce earthquake risk and promote community resilience. Southern California is data-rich and, with an urbanized population exceeding 20 million, comprises the lion's share of national earthquake risk. Recent research has posed crucial questions about the current earthquake hazard of the San Andre-as fault system. <br/>	The strategic framework for the SCEC5 Science Plan has been cast in the form of five basic questions of earthquake science: (1) How are faults loaded on different temporal and spatial scales? (2) What is the role of off-fault inelastic deformation on strain accumulation, dynamic rupture, and radiated seismic energy? (3) How do the evolving structure, composition and physical properties of fault zones and surrounding rock affect shear resistance to seismic and aseismic slip? (4) How do strong ground motions depend on the complexities and nonlinearities of dynamic earthquake systems? (5) In what ways can system-specific studies enhance the general understanding of earthquake predictability? These questions cover the key issues driving earthquake research in California, and they provide a basis for gauging the intellectual merit of proposed SCEC5 research activities.<br/>	SCEC's long-range science vision is to develop dynamical models of earthquake processes that are comprehensive, integrative, verified, predictive, and validated against observations. The science goal of the SCEC5 core program is to provide new concepts that can improve the predictability of the earth-quake system models, new data for testing the models, and a better understanding of model uncertain-ties. SCEC validation efforts tightly couple basic earthquake research to the practical needs of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, operational earthquake forecasting, earthquake early warning, and rapid earthquake response. Moreover, the risk-reduction problem?which requires actions motivated by useful information?strongly couples SCEC science to earthquake engineering. SCEC collaborations with engineering organizations are directed towards end-to-end, physics-based modeling capabilities that span system processes from ?ruptures-to-rafters.? SCEC connects to the social sciences through its mission to convey authoritative information to stakeholders in ways that result in lowered risk and enhanced resilience. SCEC's vision is to engage end-users and the public at large in on-going, community-centric conversations about how to manage particular risks by taking specific actions. The SCEC Communication, Education, and Outreach (CEO) program will promote this dialog on many levels and continue to build networks of organizational partners that can act in concert to prepare millions of people of all ages and socioeconomic levels for inevitable earthquake disasters."

These seismic social shifts have generated widespread debate around the implications of institutionalized care for child wellbeing. Yet, we know little about the ecological and organizational environments in which families arrange for their children's care. This project questions how and why local child care markets vary across communities and how this variation impacts families' child care choices and maternal employment opportunities. Beyond theoretical contributions, this project will sharpen the currently limited understanding of child care as an organizational field, responding to questions of equitable access, variations in quality and safety, and structural barriers to finding care. Results will be of interest to policymakers and social advocacy groups seeking to improve access to and the quality of child care, especially at a time of rising political interest in child care.  <br/><br/>This dissertation employs mixed-methods to examine the ecological patterning and effects of child care markets. The project is based upon a comparative and multiscalar research design, drawing data from four neighborhoods within two cities in two states. Phase one links state administrative records of child care providers and media archives with American Community Survey data within two of the largest American cities (Boston, MA and Houston, TX) which embody contrasting regulatory and social policy environments. Using spatial analysis and logistic regression, the project analyzes how the quality, safety and composition of local child care markets varies as a function of neighborhood disadvantage. Results from phase one provide the foundation for phase two, in which two neighborhoods within each city, each with similar socio demographic profiles but contrasting child care markets, are chosen for ethnographic study. Within each neighborhood, semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted among three groups of stakeholders: (1) mothers, (2) care providers, and (3) bureaucrats and nonprofit workers. Interviews will provide data on how markets are formed, why they vary, and the implications for families. The geocoded dataset from phase one, archive materials and non-confidential interview transcripts from phase two will be made available to the public. Summary reports will also be provided to nonprofit groups working within the communities of study."

The intestine also can remodel its structure and function to match meal size, to accommodate changes in diet, and to compensate for loss due to disease or surgery, but little is currently known about the precise mechanisms that underlie this remodeling. The ultimate goal of this collaborative research is to identify the signaling and structural mechanisms that enable the vertebrate intestine to modulate structure and function. Rather than relying on traditional laboratory research animals to achieve this goal, this program takes advantage of the extreme ability of some snakes (pythons, boas, and rattlesnakes) to remodel their small intestine with each meal. By comparing the cellular and molecular responses of the small intestine to feeding and fasting among snakes that feed regularly versus sporadically, and between snakes and other vertebrates, coupled with available genomic resources, this research program will provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie intestinal remodeling in vertebrates. An exciting novelty of this research is the incorporation of non-traditional model species (i.e., snakes) that have the potential to reveal previously unknown or overlooked mechanisms and that may be important for driving new discoveries for the therapeutic treatment of intestinal diseases. The project's outreach components include workshops on the generation and analyses of gene expression data, and public lectures and animal-based exhibitions to local schools, camps, and museums.<br/><br/>Vertebrates possess the physiological capacities to alter intestinal performance that are adaptively linked to their feeding habits. For example, species that naturally experience long episodes of fasting between large meals (e.g., sit-and-wait foraging snakes) experience rapid upregulation of intestinal form and function with feeding, and subsequent intestinal atrophy and downregulation following digestion. In contrast, frequently feeding species (e.g., active-foraging snakes) experience only modest change in intestinal form and function with each meal. Currently unknown are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural and functional flexibility of the intestine, and whether such mechanisms are shared across vertebrates that widely or narrowly regulate intestinal performance. By leveraging the extreme range in intestinal responses exhibited by snakes and other vertebrates, and recently available genomic resources, this research program will identify the underlying mechanisms of intestinal flexibility and. test whether these mechanisms are shared across lineages and regulatory phenotypes. This goal will be accomplished by pursuing three aims: (1) identify the cellular and structural mechanisms that underlie the modulation of intestinal form, and whether form dictates the regulation of intestinal function; (2) link transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to phenotypic changes in intestinal structure and function; and (3) test whether shared or unique sets of molecular mechanisms drive similar phenotypic responses among vertebrates. Ultimately, this research will identify the signaling and structural mechanisms by which vertebrates modulate intestinal form and function."

Topological orders are exotic phases of quantum systems, in which ordinary electrons behave as if they were divided into smaller particles that contain fractions of the original mass and charge. These emerging particles are called anyons, and due to their quantum properties they could be used in implementing quantum computation. One example of topological order is the so-called quantum spin liquid, a nonmagnetic phase of matter that can emerge in systems of interacting quantum magnets. While topological orders are highly desirable for their potential applications, there are two longstanding obstacles in achieving control of anyons: (i) anyons in topological orders are hard to detect; (ii) topological orders are quite rare in nature to begin with.<br/><br/>This project aims at filling those two gaps in the context of quantum spin liquids. The PI will exploit magnetic impurities that are ubiquitous in real materials to identify a ""smoking gun"" signature for the detection of anyons in a quantum spin liquid. The PI will also identify new guiding principles to search for realistic models of and materials hosting quantum spin liquids, by building a road map between rare quantum spin liquids and abundant magnetic orders in nature. These research efforts not only bring new ideas for the detection and realization of topological orders, but also shed new light on impurity physics in various quantum magnetic materials.<br/> <br/>This award also supports educational and outreach efforts that are integrated with the research.

Quantum spin liquids are exotic ground states of frustrated magnets, which evade all symmetry-breaking orders down to zero temperature. They can support topological orders featuring fractionalized excitations (anyons), which could become building blocks for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Though highly desirable, the experimental detection of anyons in quantum spin liquids has been a longstanding challenge. Moreover, the rarity of quantum spin liquids in nature calls for new design principles. <br/><br/>This project will address these two significant issues. The PI will address the detection issue by answering the following question: is there a ""smoking gun"" signature of anyons in quantum spin liquids? Magnetic impurities will be explored as a means to provide sharp signatures of anyons, which could subsequently be probed by thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in real materials. The effects of magnetic impurities in quantum spin liquids will be investigated by a synergy between analytical effort, numerical simulation, and exact solutions from idealized models. <br/><br/>The PI will also address the design issue by constructing new models that host quantum spin liquid ground states. This will be achieved by combining an algebraic classification of symmetry-breaking orders in proximity to quantum spin liquids with unbiased numerical simulations. New classes of quantum criticality between a quantum spin liquid and proximate symmetry-breaking phases will also be investigated. <br/><br/>This award also supports educational and outreach efforts that are integrated with the research. In addition to mentoring graduate students and developing modern courses synergistically with the research activities, the PI will also mentor master's degree students from underrepresented groups, involving them in cutting-edge research.

Regrettably, approximately 40% of students who begin their undergraduate studies intending to pursue a STEM major do not complete a STEM degree. However, recent developments in STEM education research have demonstrated convincingly that student success rates can be significantly improved by utilizing instructional methods that actively engage students in their courses. Due to evolving national demographics, the STEM education community must also strive to engage learners from diverse backgrounds and origins to further ensure a sufficient supply of STEM talent for the domestic workforce.  Considering that the population growth rate of Hispanic citizens and permanent residents outpaces all other racial and ethnic groups, this project will focus on STEM education issues in two-year Hispanic-serving institutions (2Y-HSIs) located in California's San Diego and Imperial Counties. Specifically, this research will investigate factors that influence the implementation of active learning strategies by STEM instructors in 2Y-HSIs and how the active learning impacts the students in their classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will conduct STEM education research on capacity-building professional development efforts for 20 STEM instructors from participating 2Y-HSIs. The research foci will be primarily two-fold, exploring factors that influence instructors to change their teaching methods, and examining how the newly-established active learning environments impact student success. This project will contribute to the knowledge base about instructional change strategies and active learning in 2Y-HSIs, which are institutions of increasing national importance. During each year of the two-year project, 10 STEM instructors from the 2Y-HSIs will participate in a three-day Course Design Studio offered by the Center for Engaged Teaching at UC San Diego. The participants will redesign their STEM courses and, with follow-up support from the project team of Principal Investigators and UC San Diego graduate students, implement the redesigned courses and conduct assessments of their impacts. The graduate students will have completed a set of courses in teaching and learning and graduate teaching apprenticeships in 3-4 undergraduate courses. Results from the research will be disseminated through local symposia that convene 2Y-HSI instructors and administrators with UC San Diego and UT Austin collaborators, along with broader-ranging meetings, conferences and targeted scholarly journals."

This is specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to access the best research in Asian countries. Broader impacts will include potential US collaborative efforts in HPC research. More importantly, it enables US researchers to keep abreast of developments in Asia and to incorporate the best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in the US to keep abreast of the priorities of funding agencies in HPC. <br/>The Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Asian researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components, system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high potential for research interests that overlap with their Asian counterparts and who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the international research community have agreed to support attendance by similar students from Asian countries who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work.

DNA is first copied into messenger RNA (mRNA) that provides the instructions that are translated to make proteins. For most mRNAs, the cellular machinery recognizes the cap located at the beginning of the message as well as other signals to decide where to start translation. However up to 10% of cellular mRNAs and many viruses, use different, poorly understood, signals called internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) to determine where to initiate protein synthesis. This project will provide new insights into the means by which cells carry out this process and how it is regulated. Earlier studies have shown that mRNAs for several genes that synthesize heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs; proteins with long attached sugar chains) contain IRES, and that translation of their mRNAs is regulated during development. The goal of this project is to identify the signals that mark IRES, as well as genes that control the translation of these IRES-containing mRNAs. This research will use the fruitfly Drosophila, because it allows application of powerful genetic and molecular approaches that cannot be easily employed in other animals. Importantly, IRES and proteoglycans are present in all multicellular animals, so results from this work will be useful in understanding their roles in many organisms ranging from worms to humans. In addition to PhD scientists, undergraduate students will participate in the proposed research, helping them develop a deeper understanding of scientific principles as well as planning, analytical and intellectual skills. Undergraduates who have trained in the lab will serve as peer tutors for a large genetics class. The effectiveness of 'research trained' and 'regular' peer tutors will be compared to test if this approach can be used to enhance student performance in large lecture classes more broadly. <br/><br/><br/>HSPGs are extracellular and cell surface macromolecules found in all multicellular animals. They play key roles in development by affecting the transport, stability and signaling activity of multiple growth factors. Earlier studies showed that HSPGs are absent from early Drosophila embryos due to inhibited translation of GAG synthetic enzyme mRNAs. Further, transcripts for the Drosophila GAG chain co-polymerase Tout velu (Ttv; EXT1 in vertebrates) and the N-deacetylase/sulfotransferase (NDST) Sulfateless (Sfl) were found to contain IRESs that are negatively regulated during the first three hours of development. Homologous transcripts in other species have complex 5?UTRs, and the 5? UTR from human EXT1 also mediates temporally regulated translation in the early fly embryo suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism. The project examines the mechanisms underlying this translational regulation by pursuing three Aims:<br/>(1) To determine whether translational regulation and/or the presence of IRES elements is a common property of other HSPG biosynthetic enzyme transcripts.<br/>(2) To identify cis elements essential for translational regulation of the HSPG synthetic enzymes, Ttv and Sfl.<br/>(3) To identify trans acting factors required for the regulation of GAG chain synthesis and IRES function through genetic and molecular screens."

The project will build upon Miami University's Urban Teaching Cohort program which employs the community-based and culturally responsive approach to teacher preparation. In this approach, teacher candidates are incrementally and intentionally immersed in community- and school-based experiences as they prepare to teach in partner schools serving high-need communities. Preparing future science and mathematics teachers as agents of social justice is a necessary shift if racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse students from high-need school districts and economically disadvantaged communities are to internalize the knowledge and critical consciousness that will prepare and empower them to seize opportunities for college and career, as well as to advocate for themselves, their families, and communities. Additionally, data collected from this project will measure the effectiveness of this approach on candidates' learning to teach by comparing it with traditional approaches to STEM teacher preparation which lack a multicultural focus.<br/><br/>This project is a partnership involving the university's College of Education, Health and Society, College of Arts and Science, and Urban Teaching Cohort program in collaboration with Cincinnati Public School and Middletown City School districts in Ohio. The project will offer two scholarship and stipend pathways and an internship option for 34 talented STEM undergraduates and STEM professionals to pursue secondary science or mathematics teacher certification in grades 7-12. Pathway 1 will prepare undergraduate STEM majors who commit to becoming Noyce scholars through the pursuit of a double major in a STEM content discipline and in integrated mathematics or a science education. Pathway 2 will provide one-year stipends to support outstanding STEM professionals and recent STEM graduates to pursue teacher certification through a master's degree in secondary science or mathematics education. The project will also provide a robust mentoring and professional development project for Noyce scholars that supports their transition into full-time teaching and assists them during the difficult early-induction period, where research cites the highest rate of teacher attrition occurs."

Their mission is to produce good citizens by promoting academics, leadership, discipline, and community service. This project will explore the role of junior police programs in schools and how they shape students' experiences with adults and peers within the educational institution. While much of the research on school-police partnerships focuses on punishment and exclusionary discipline practices such as detentions, suspensions, expulsions, and arrests, junior police programs are another avenue through which criminal justice and educational institutions collaborate. Thus, the intellectual merit of this study will expand knowledge on various forms of policing and how it shapes the experiences of young people. In terms of broader impacts, findings related to school practices, peer culture, and vocational programs will inform policies and practices to improve the well-being of youth, particularly those in marginalized communities.<br/><br/>To understand how membership in the junior police program shapes youth's experiences in school, this study will use qualitative methods to compare the experiences of junior police students with that of their non-member peers at an urban high school. Observations will be conducted in various spaces such as classrooms, school events, and junior police activities to examine themes related to educational resources, mentoring, disciplinary practices, and peer networks. Interviews will be conducted with actors across various positions in the institutional setting, such as teachers, administrators, junior police students, and other students not in the program. Questions for adults will address topics such as their experiences in their professional role, interactions with students, and perceptions of school activities. Questions for students will address topics such as their interactions with authorities, resources they receive, relationships with peers, and future aspirations. The goal of this research will be to capture the social dynamics in the school organization and to understand the discourses related to the junior police in the context of a community that regularly faces various forms of criminal justice intervention. This research will thus theorize new ways of understanding social control beyond existing punitive frameworks."

The study of the properties of such maps led to the development of the subject known as geometric function theory. A cornerstone of this discipline is the remarkable fact that every planar region without holes can be conformally transformed into the round disk in an essentially unique fashion. Such coordinate changes have proven over the years to be of great value in a wide variety of applications in physics and engineering. In many of these applications, one has to deal with coordinate changes that are conformal in a given planar region except possibly some ""exceptional set"" of points inside the region. The question whether the exceptional set is negligible and small enough to be ignored leads to the notion of conformal removability, central to this research project and closely related to fundamental questions in complex dynamics and in random surfaces. The project will also consider several other questions in geometric function theory, such as conformal welding (a correspondence between curves in the plane and functions on the circle, recently observed to have important applications in the field of numerical vision), shapes of Julia sets (fractal sets arising from the iteration of polynomials), and the subadditivity of analytic capacity. Each of these investigations has a numerical aspect, and successful completion of the research project will enhance computational structure and build interdisciplinary connections with applied sciences such as finance and pattern recognition.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project deals with the study of the geometric properties of conformally removable sets. More precisely, the investigator will further study various settings where removability appears naturally, including the rigidity of circle domains. This first component of the research project also includes problems related to conformal welding and fingerprints of lemniscates. The second part is devoted to the study of the possible shapes of Julia sets. More specifically, the investigator plans to explore various questions revolving around the constructive approximation of planar sets by polynomial Julia sets in the Hausdorff distance, such as sharp rates of approximation, dynamical properties of the approximating polynomials, and an efficient numerical implementation of the approximation scheme. Finally, the last part of the research project concerns the subadditivity problem for analytic capacity. The investigator will further explore a conjecture that, if true, would imply analytic capacity is indeed subadditive. This involves an improvement of a numerical method for the computation of the analytic capacity of finite unions of disks."

There are, however, processes that create organic molecules that do not require life or the activity of any living or previously living thing. These are called abiotic (i.e., not biological) processes. One of these is the Fischer-Tropsch process which converts inorganic carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons. It is suspected that this process is important in earth systems, like seafloor hydrothermal vents, where seawater circulating deep into the ocean crust gets heated by magmatic bodies and reacts at relatively high temperatures with surrounding rocks altering them and creating hydrocarbons without the influence of organisms or their organic products.  This Faculty Early Career Development Project establishes an integrated research and education program at the University of Houston that is dedicated to improving our understanding of abiotic organic synthesis processes in seafloor hydrothermal systems, which have been proposed as possible sites for prebiotic organic synthesis and the origin of life on Earth. The reaction mechanisms and controlling factors of the resulting organic formation process will be studied in the laboratory at conditions analogous to those present in natural seafloor hydrothermal environments.  Research will involve a combination of laboratory experiments, advanced analytical techniques for chemical and isotopic characterization, and a comparison of experimental results to samples from seafloor hydrothermal vents. Broader impacts of the work include tight integration of education and research activities designed to improve undergraduate and graduate education, with a focus of engaging students from minority groups, under-represented in the sciences, in the research program. It will also involve extensive interaction with the local Houston school district to reach out to middle and high school students to give them firsthand knowledge of how cutting edge geochemical research on the origin of life and generation of hydrocarbons is done. This will be accomplished via K-12 tours of the laboratory facilities and discussion with the researcher and his students on how these kinds of experiments are carried out and how the resulting data are analyzed and interpreted.  Goals of this outreach are to raise students' awareness of science and how it is done and to motivate them into building careers in geosciences. Additional impacts include building infrastructure for science through the development of new analytical techniques and reactor design. Other impacts of the work include support an early career faculty member and has the potential to cross fields to inform and find application in the chemical and petroleum engineering fields.<br/><br/>This research is fundamental to understanding the formation of abiotically generated organic molecules in seafloor hydrothermal systems. It will examine Fisher-Tropsch reactions associated with the abiotic generation of hydrocarbons. A laboratory experimental program that uses a novel reactor and state-of-the-art analytical methods will be carried out to study fluid-mineral-catalyzed organic synthesis at high temperatures and conditions similar to those in hydrothermal systems on mid-ocean ridges. Experimental charges will include natural minerals similar to those in seafloor environments; and experiments will focus on identifying reaction mechanisms that occur during organic synthesis. During the project, reaction mechanisms of abiotically generated organic compounds will be studied and systematic identification of molecular species in liquid, gas, and species adsorbed on mineral surfaces that are generated under a variety of physicochemical conditions in a state-of-the-art reactor system will be determined. Analytical work will include the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, pyrolysis gas chromatographic mass spectrometry, nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition, the carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures of newly generated organic compounds will be measured and the isotope signature of abiotically generated methane will be analyzed using the clumped isotope method to try to determine whether controlling factors affecting formation, other than temperature, are in play. In particular, compounds such as long chain hydrocarbons, homologous alkanes, alcohols, and carboxylic acids will be targeted because each is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Results of the laboratory experiments will be compared to the composition and physico-chemical conditions of formation of select vent fluid samples that were collected on oceanographic expeditions to mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vents."

Large-scale physics-based earthquake simulations are essential scientific tools that can be used to better understand these hazardous natural phenomena. This project will develop physics-based codes for simulating earthquakes on Blue Waters and apply these simulation capabilities to improve existing hazard analysis methods. The very large scale computing and data management capabilities of the  Blue Waters system will allow the project to develop and test earthquake models that capture physics in a more realistic manner, and to run simulations at finer resolutions and higher frequencies. The results will better quantify seismic hazards and their uncertainties. <br/><br/>This project will advance physics-based probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) methods using numerical experimentation and large-scale simulations to increase the scale range in current representations of source physics, anelasticity, and geologic heterogeneity.  Specifically, the research project will work towards seven computational objectives defined to improve our understanding of earthquake processes and advance physics-based PSHA: (1) Develop an empirically-calibrated physics-based earthquake forecast. (2) Develop a statistically sufficient, but reduced, rupture set representative of the new Unified California Earthquake Rupture Forecast. (3) Implement a new dynamic-rupture based kinematic source model to compute ground motions up to 8 cycles per second. (4) Evaluate the basin connectivity phenomenon observed in previous simulations to establish the importance of waveguide modeling at low seismic frequencies. (5) Investigate and characterize the influence of material and source models on the accuracy of ground motion simulations. (6) Validate and calibrate the rheological models used in simulations. (7) Test the physics-based hazard capabilities on a vulnerable embankment dam.

Conventionally, the direction of magnetization of a small magnet dictates these spin states and thus ferromagnetic materials are essential for spintronic devices. However, there are a few obstacles for further advancing the spin devices based on the ferromagnetic materials: the electric current density for switching the magnetization direction remains too large and the size reduction of memory elements is fundamentally difficult due to a strong magnetic interaction among nanometer-sized magnetic elements in close vicinity. The present proposal is to explore alternative magnetic materials known as antiferromagnets for spin-based devices. Antiferromagnetic materials are made of two or more sub-lattices in which the spins of each sub-lattice are oriented in one direction, but the total or net magnetization is zero. In spite of many intriguing and superior electric and magnetic properties, the antiferromagnetic materials have not been used as magnetically active elements for spin device applications. If one is able to manipulate spin states in antiferromagnetic materials, one would create a disruption spin-based technology which is faster, denser, and more energy efficient, compared to ferromagnetic based devices. The proposal calls for a comprehensive theoretical investigation on how devices made of the antiferromagnetic materials and their multilayers respond to the time-dependent external electric and magnetic fields. The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of antiferromagnetic based spin devices and to find optimal materials parameters in various structure. The educational components of the proposal include strong graduate student participations in research, training, and visiting industrial research laboratories, as well as for PI to develop a spintronics course related to this research project.<br/><br/>In today's spintronics, spins of conduction electrons play a pivotal role in carrying angular momentum information and manipulating the magnetization dynamics of magnetic nanostructures. Antiferromagnetic materials have no net spin or magnetization, but they have two distinct magnetic characteristics: a staggered magnetic moment and a quasi-particle excitation known as antiferromagnetic magnons. Both staggered moment and magnons could carry angular momentum and serve as spin information propagators. This proposal aims at a comprehensive study on the roles of these carriers. In metallic systems, a theory of coupled electron-magnon conduction, which is capable of predicting new magnetotransport properties, will be developed. In insulating materials, the mutual dependence of the direction of staggered moments and the non-equilibrium number of magnons is the main focus of research. The proposal further explores the following novel spin-dependent properties of antiferromagnetic-based multilayered structures: 1) Quantitatively determining spin current from the flow of the electron spins, the staggered magnetic moments, and magnons, as well as their conversion rates across interfaces in various multilayered systems. 2) Investigating the interplay between the staggered moments and magnons for magnetic control. 3) Exploring possible spintronics device concepts based on the antiferromagnetic materials. If successful, the present research could reveal knowledge for staggered magnetic momentum and magnons which may have superior capabilities for enhanced spin information propagation in spintronic applications."

When signals across a wide frequency band are of interest, a fundamental tradeoff between sampling rate, amplitude quantization precision, cost, and power consumption is encountered. The investigators study low resolution sampling techniques with general thresholds, which are affordable, technically feasible, easy to apply, energy-efficient, and consistent with technological trends. The enormous gains in capacity and spectral efficiency, for example, that could be provided by a successful millimeter wave (mm-wave) massive multiple-input multiple output implementation could have a revolutionary effect on the performance of wireless systems nearly everywhere we use them: at home, at work, at school, commuting via public transportation or by plane, shopping, at restaurants, recreational venues, sporting events, and so on. Besides consumer applications, there are many military- and security-related scenarios where our systems could be used.<br/><br/>This project involves advancing fundamental knowledge in developing dynamic energy-efficient and cost-effective sampling techniques and applies engineering principles to address the critical needs of several important and related applications. Specifically, this project involves  addressing significant open questions, including deterministic identifiability, performance bounds, and impact of thresholding pattern on spectrum sensing and array processing, radio frequency interference mitigation, and mm-wave communications to gain fundamental insights into the novel paradigm of low resolution sampling with general thresholds, devising novel signal processing algorithms, including effective and efficient sparse signal recovery techniques and parametric maximum likelihood methods for enhanced performance, and evaluating and demonstrating the performance using measured data.

This project develops representations of geometric commonsense as well as computing principles of commonsense reasoning for computer vision applications. The project systemically studies commonsense knowledge over geometric dimensions of scene entities, e.g., the length of a sedan is shorter than that of a bus; or that window edges on the same faade are parallel to each other and are orthogonal to the edges on the ground. These first-order and second-order knowledges, once extracted, are fairly stable across different types of scenes, and are informative enough for enhancing the understanding of images or videos in both 2D and 3D. The project integrates research with education by supporting graduate students, and outreaches to computer vision and AI research communities by organizing workshops in the relevant conferences.<br/><br/>This research studies geometric commonsense reasoning for 3D scene parsing in images or videos, and contributes a unified probabilistic approach that is capable of reconstructing a wide variety of scene categories (e.g., suburb, urban, campus) from a single input image or a monocular video sequence.  The project approaches the problem from two aspects. First, a new attributed grammar model is developed to represent both images and the associated geometric commonsense knowledge using a hierarchical graphical structure. With this grammar model, the segmentation of semantic regions, the reconstruction of scene entities, and the reasoning of geometric commonsense can be all solved through creating a valid parse graph from images or videos. Second, a new computing framework is introduced so that the inference of image parsing can be conducted in the joint space of discrete semantic labels and continuous geometric labels, and the learning of grammar models can be conducted over training images with weak supervision. The developed techniques enable a state-of-the-art computer vision system that can robustly estimate semantic and geometric scene structures from images or videos."

For example, such experimental evaluation of new design concepts and devices is intended to examine the performance of civil infrastructure, such as buildings and lifelines, when exposed to natural hazards, such as earthquakes and windstorms.  Thus, these experiments enable knowledge generation and innovations that will reduce fatalities, maintain business continuity, and minimize economic losses resulting from natural hazards. A growing interdisciplinary and international community of researchers is using hybrid simulation to address societal grand challenge problems related to multi-hazard engineering. However, existing technical barriers have limited advancements in hybrid simulation. This research coordination network will be established to accelerate progress in advanced hybrid simulation methodologies to address societal grand challenges, build capacity in a range of laboratories, and build partnerships among engineering disciplines.  <br/><br/>This research coordination network aims to facilitate the scientific advances needed to establish the theory of and expand the capacity for hybrid simulation as it applies to multi-hazard engineering. The specific objectives are to: (1) diversify, broaden, and expand the community of researchers in hybrid simulation, (2) foster peer-to-peer and institute-to-institute partnerships that will be able to tackle the scientific challenges that lie ahead, (3) develop the common research agenda for hybrid simulation, (4) share digital artifacts, such as open-source data, models, lectures, techniques, and tools, across laboratories and disciplinary boundaries, (5) build the capacity for hybrid simulation in a greater number of existing laboratories, and (6) cultivate international collaborations to share knowledge and enable access to resources. These objectives will be achieved through activities such as focused workshops, online networking, sharing of resources, peer-to-peer communications, international partnerships, research agenda development, and dissemination activities. Digital artifacts, such as computational models, experimental data, and learning materials, will be gathered and shared through the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Designsafe-ci.org web portal. A diverse, core group of junior faculty and graduate students will be engaged, while senior and mid-career faculty also will participate and share expertise. By breaking down the existing technical barriers that have limited the advancement of hybrid simulation methods, this broader community of researchers will be prepared to solve societal grand challenge problems related to natural hazard events."

Next, by a major scientific breakthrough in the utilization of small quantities of low quality sensor data and IR images to determine damage information at all levels: detection of a change in behavior, location, and magnitude; streamlining of reliability analysis to incorporate the new information of damage into the bridge's reliability index based on combined numerical and probabilistic approaches such as Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with the Hilbert Transform; and finally detection of nonlinearities in the signals in a Bayesian Updating framework. Moreover, an instrumented drive-by vehicle will complement damage detection on the bridge. A Bayesian updating framework will be used to update the probability distribution for bridge condition, given the measurements. Image processing of the infrared images to distinguish between the environmental effects and the true bridge deterioration (e.g. delamination in concrete) will be used to develop a better method of site-specific and environment-specific calibration."

A major part of any control system is its instrumentation, i.e., sensors and actuators. Due to information exchange between the controller and the instrumentation, the control system performance may be compromised by attacks on its sensors and actuators. Indeed, the sensors may project erroneous information to the controller and the actuators may receive undesirable commands, possibly leading to a catastrophe. In this research, the control system is referred to as resilient, if it identifies attacks on the sensors and actuators involved in the feedback loops and mitigates undesirable effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a theory for analysis and design of resilient control systems with respect to attacks on the instrumentation and to demonstrate its efficacy using the High Performance Building Testbed at the United Technologies Research Center. The broader impact of the project is in its effect on cyber-security of critical infrastructure systems, such as power, telecommunications, transportation, high performance buildings, gas, oil, and water.<br/><br/>    In this project, we consider control systems, in which the sensors and actuators may be under various types of instrumentation attacks through transfer function modification and/or external deception signal injection. This project include developing the following techniques: A method for system vulnerability evaluation with respect to various instrumentation attacks; a method for optimal controller design to minimize performance degradation under attacks, while meeting desired performance specifications under non-attacked condition; a method for actuator/sensor health assessment in control systems using the synchronous detection approach; a method for design of resilient feedback controllers, driven by the actuator and sensor health to detect, identify, and mitigate instrumentation attacks; a method for knowledge fusion for process variable estimation based on multiple sensors and control signal calculation based on the knowledge fusion results.

In human societies, periods of great social upheaval, whether due to war, economic change or natural disaster, tend to be accompanied by religious innovation. In such circumstances, people may feel compelled to change religious practices, institutions, or even create new religions. But while it is clear that social upheaval and religious innovation are causally related, much less is known about the nature of these linkages. For example, do social upheavals give rise to religious innovations, is the reverse more often true, or do the causal arrows fly in both directions? The global diversity of both the nature of the upheavals and the religions involved make such questions hard to answer systematically. Therefore, to better understand the relationship between social upheaval and religious change, this workshop has chosen a unique approach. It will focus on a single site where a recent social upheaval has been experienced by all but there are multiple innovating religions operating in the post-upheaval period.<br/><br/>The site is the South Asian country of Sri Lanka, a multi-ethnic, religiously plural state, where Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and many new religious movements co-exist. In 2009, Sri Lanka concluded a highly disruptive, twenty-six year long, inter-ethnic civil war, costing tens of thousands of lives. The social scientists participating in this workshop comprise specialists in the full gamut of Sri Lanka's traditional religions and new religious movements. The aims of this workshop are three:  empirical, theoretical, and practical. Empirically, the workshop will document and compare religious innovation across Sri Lanka in the post-war period, searching for common underlying patterns. The presence or absence of such patterns would set  distinct theoretical directions for further work. Practically, the workshop aims use these findings to create a set of common research questions to coordinate future, collaborative research, to leverage the research opportunity presented by having multiple religions present in a single post-war setting. The proceedings of the workshop will be taped for use by other scholars and students. Findings will be disseminated through scholarly publication and public presentations."

Situated in economic sociology and cultural sociology, this dissertation will contribute to the literature of entrepreneurship by directing attention to the under-studied role that culture plays.  It will also enhance understanding of the contemporary meaning of work as well as the globalization of capitalism. There are few issues that are more crucial than understanding the meaning of work, given that we spend most of our awake time pursuing one type of work or another.  Understanding the fundamental question of what work means to people will inform public discourses on job motivation, satisfaction, and work-life balance.  Furthermore, this study will have practical implications for public policies aiming to encourage innovation and economic development.   <br/><br/>Led by the enormous success of Silicon Valley, entrepreneurial fervor in the 1980's has spread across countries and cultures. Chief among them is the recent phenomenal rise of entrepreneurship in China.  In 2015 alone, venture capitalists poured a record $37 billion into Chinese startups, making China second in the global league (Ernst and Young 2016). Such rapidity of the rise of entrepreneurship is puzzling.  Unlike Protestant ethics, for more than a millennium, the Chinese traditional culture valued intellectual pursuits rather than market opportunistic behaviors.  Business people were perceived as low status, and capitalists were even punished under Mao.  It was only after Deng's open and reform policy in the late 70's that China gradually relaxed its constraint on private businesses, and it was not until 2000 that China emerged as a global hotbed for entrepreneurship.  Given this traditionally unfavorable if not outright hostile environment, how did entrepreneurship grow to today's vibrancy? Particularly, how did the cultural environment change, and how do entrepreneurs in China make sense of their identity and their role in the society?  How are these understandings different from or similar to those in the U.S.?  Using interviews and participant observations, this project seeks to uncover the current cultural meaning of entrepreneurship.  This dissertation will also take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning techniques and topic modeling to analyze large media text corpora in order to examine how the meaning of entrepreneurship has evolved over time."

Recent observational data suggest an acceleration of mass loss, and consequent global sea level rise, from Greenland.  There is, though, no consensus on what future trends may be.  Thus, there is urgency in defining priorities for addressing the Greenland Ice Sheet stability problem.  Funds are provided for a workshop on the stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet.  A community of experts will be assembled to assess the current state of knowledge of Greenland Ice Sheet history and sensitivity to climate forcing.  The group also will suggest key research priorities that would promote traction on the problem of Greenland Ice Sheet stability.  Improved understanding of Greenland Ice Sheet history, the associated processes, and its possible future will significantly impact our ability to predict and mitigate sea level rise. The workshop will guarantee gender and age diversity, thus ensuring the introduction of new members to the national and international community represented at the workshop. <br/> <br/>Understanding ice sheet stability is important for understanding and projecting sea level rise.  However, we do not currently have data or models that allow for a definitive consensus view of ice sheet variability during the past, much less the future.  Recent measurements of cosmogenic isotopes demand the absence of ice at the GISP2 summit drill site for significant portions of the Pleistocene. On the other hand, new and published data from other ice cores in central Greenland and from offshore sediment records have been interpreted to suggest persistence of the ice sheet through the Plio-Pleistocene.  While numerical ice sheet simulations reveal a smaller, but relatively intact Greenland Ice Sheet during the Last Interglaciation, new discoveries from the glacial dynamics community reveal processes that could lead to the collapse of continental ice in Greenland.  Thus, the workshop will focus on assessing and reconciling the state of knowledge and understanding of four important sub-disciplines - ice coring, stratigraphic records, ice sheet modeling, and ice sheet processes."

Some of the scale-dependent behavior arises from ""defects"" or ""mechanical discontinuities"" that exist in the rock. These discontinuities range from the atomic scale, where atom lattices may have irregularities; to the grain scale, where cracks are pervasive at the grain contacts, and up to the regional or continental scale where discontinuities such joints occur from the millimeter scale to faults that range over hundreds of kilometers, such as the North Anatolian fault or the San Andreas fault.  One of the most important limitations in research and engineering practice on rocks is our inability to detect accurately the presence of defects and discontinuities inside the rock and to determine the evolution of discontinuities with stress from external agents. Current knowledge of rock damage strongly relies on experiments in the laboratory where direct observations of the surfaces of the rock specimens are made to observe new crack formation. The objective of the research is to establish the relationship between mechanical and geophysical responses of rock under loading to provide a basis for seismic monitoring techniques of rock systems, and to enable the development of analysis tools to evaluate the condition of a rock mass during and after construction. The promise of using elastic wave propagation through fractured rock as an effective monitoring technique is rooted in previous findings by the two Co-PIs who discovered the presence of precursors prior to shear failure of frictional discontinuities, in the form of either distinct maxima or minima in transmitted and reflected waves, respectively. Advances in our ability to detect impending new damage in the form of new cracks or slip along pre-existing discontinuities will prevent failures during construction, ensure long term containment for waste storage, or avoid earthquakes induced by anthropogenic activities such as mining, underground fluid storage or deep wastewater injection.<br/><br/>A series of laboratory experiments will be performed to test the hypotheses that these precursors (1) result from a reduction in local fracture specific stiffness in the region monitored by the seismic transducers, and (2) are caused by slip and damage of the asperities, and the hypothesis that failure along the entire discontinuity is the result of progressive slip along the discontinuity. The experiments will consist of subjecting rock joints to biaxial compression loading, and more specifically to direct shear. Digital Image Correlation and geophysical methods will be used to monitor slip and slip failure of the joints, which include wave propagation measurements (both transmitted and reflected waves, as well as other converted modes). The tests will be conducted on granite, limestone or sandstone and shale, each rock having different grain size and anisotropy, and on joints that may be tight or filled with a soil deposit. Both dry and saturated rock specimens will be investigated to determine the geophysical signatures associated with changes in rock saturation, and to identify and quantify the modes that are best-suited for monitoring the potential shear failure of a discontinuity."

The dissertation project examines the ways in which these tensions are negotiated by investigating empirically a significant reconfiguration in the meaning and processing of asylum claims in the United States. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, the project will expand knowledge about the asylum adjudication process. Due to limitations of data, previous studies have yielded a somewhat misleading account of asylum adjudications as inherently inconsistent. In contrast, analyzing newly available data, this research project argues that there is considerable uniformity in how officers frame claims. Applicants are required by the state to align their narratives with the standardized ""knowledge"" of conflict formed about their country. Deviations from these standardized knowledge often meet resistance. This suggests that a key interpretative stage of asylum adjudications generates heretofore unexpected uniformity and consistency, with direct policy implications for asylum reform. Second, this project addresses theoretical debates concerning the gap between formal commitments to, and compliance with, humanitarianism. Previous studies have approached this question by focusing on the interrelations between humanitarianism and nationalism. This research goes beyond the nationalism-humanitarianism binary and reveals how humanitarianism functions are the organizing principle of an administrative adjudicatory regime. It suggests that the primary challenges of adhering to humanitarian principles in the context of asylum are not only national interests. Rather, it is the diversity of information inherent to the individuation of the adjudication process, which leads asylum officers to rely on default generalizations, obscuring the individual narratives they were supposed to prioritize. <br/><br/>The research project addresses current gaps in asylum literature concerning a core stage of the asylum decision-making process, and sets to determine the impact of sheer information overload and ambiguous law, on organizational decision-making, by providing the first mixed method based account of how adjudicators translate individual testimonies of harm into the standardized rubrics of persecution recognized under law. Specifically, it analyzes new and comprehensive data, obtained by filing a Freedom of Information request from the Department of Homeland Security. The data consist of over one million cases adjudicated by the US asylum office between fiscal years 1995 and 2015. This is the first dataset to include such comprehensive information on officers' decisions about applicants' bases of claims. Quantitative analysis of this data is supplemented with participant observations at immigration firms and interviews with asylum officers and immigration attorneys. The findings of this study will shed new light on the workings of the asylum office, one of the largest adjudication systems in the country, and contribute to general sociological understandings of processes of classification and categorization in a constantly changing information environment."

When signals across a wide frequency band are of interest, a fundamental tradeoff between sampling rate, amplitude quantization precision, cost, and power consumption is encountered. The investigators study low resolution sampling techniques with general thresholds, which are affordable, technically feasible, easy to apply, energy-efficient, and consistent with technological trends. The enormous gains in capacity and spectral efficiency, for example, that could be provided by a successful millimeter wave (mm-wave) massive multiple-input multiple output implementation could have a revolutionary effect on the performance of wireless systems nearly everywhere we use them: at home, at work, at school, commuting via public transportation or by plane, shopping, at restaurants, recreational venues, sporting events, and so on. Besides consumer applications, there are many military- and security-related scenarios where our systems could be used.<br/><br/>This project involves advancing fundamental knowledge in developing dynamic energy-efficient and cost-effective sampling techniques and applies engineering principles to address the critical needs of several important and related applications. Specifically, this project involves  addressing significant open questions, including deterministic identifiability, performance bounds, and impact of thresholding pattern on spectrum sensing and array processing, radio frequency interference mitigation, and mm-wave communications to gain fundamental insights into the novel paradigm of low resolution sampling with general thresholds, devising novel signal processing algorithms, including effective and efficient sparse signal recovery techniques and parametric maximum likelihood methods for enhanced performance, and evaluating and demonstrating the performance using measured data. This project also involves preparing students for engineering in the 21st century through the incorporation of practical design and problem-solving techniques into both the education curriculum."

Easy, reliable access to trustworthy, quality-controlled data on the Earth and its environment is critical for enabling the mining and analysis of multi-disciplinary datasets that make scientific breakthroughs happen and increase our knowledge of the Earth and the things that happen on and below its surface. The increasing number of large-volume, automatically-generated datasets; the need to convert important legacy data and datasets that are presently available only on paper in journals and other scientific publications; the need to educate students, faculty, and the public in proper data management and curation so they can access already-collected data or make their data useable by others; and the need to improve discovery of existing legacy data and combine information from disparate data types or that are in different formats is a major challenge not only for geoscience but for other fields of science as well.   As a result, geoscience data increasingly need to be professionally managed and curated to both make these data easily and publicly available and to maximize their potential for use for research which can provide benefits to society. This funding renews support for the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), one of the premiere, NSF-funded, solid-earth, data repositories.  IEDA provides discovery and public access to a large volume and variety of NSF-funded data as well as that from a number of other sources so these data can be used and reused by anyone. IEDA was established in 2009 from a series of independent data management/curation activities to provide a single clearinghouse with shared cyberinfrastructure and tools to help solid-earth, NSF-funded, researchers from the ocean, earth, and polar geosciences deposit their data for public access and to discover and reuse data collected by themselves and others to do new science.  IEDA develops and operates the necessary databases, software tools, and services that support investigators with data stewardship and access throughout the full data life cycle, with a special focus on disciplines that typically generate and use complex, heterogeneous, structured and unstructured datasets that are particularly challenging to manage and combine. IEDA hosts and serves data that includes marine seismic data and bathymetry; rock and seafloor sediment and hydrothermal vent fluid geochemistry; geochronology; Antarctic research; information about physical samples; and other marine and earth science data. It also has developed and deployed map-based data discovery tools and compiled data products that enable quick identification of data and/or datasets of interest. Researchers from across the US and around the world have used IEDA data and tools and combined them in novel ways to study a wide variety of topics, such as providing new insights on the evolution of mid-ocean ridges and processes happening on continental margins, seafloor and hotspot processes, mantle geodynamics, geohazards, sediment transport between the continents and oceans, global geochemical cycles, and Earth surface processes.  All of these would have been impossible or difficult to do in a timely manner without the use of IEDA data holdings and discovery tools. In addition to the broader impacts of promoting public access to important NSF-funded and other geoscience data, other broader impacts of the facility include development of a diverse and highly connected geoinformatics workforce, with a focus on promoting and training women in the field; student and postdoctoral training, within the facility, in data management and curation; education and training of students and faculty across the nation in the importance of data sharing, best practices in data collection and curation, metadata preparation, the processes for making data amenable for reuse and reanalysis by others, and in accessing IEDA and the data systems to which it is linked.<br/><br/>The Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) is a unique facility whose operations are based on a partnership of domain-specific data systems that are scientifically linked in their relevance for studies of the solid Earth. These systems share a common repository infrastructure and work together to offer integrated services for data submission and data discovery and access that support interdisciplinary research. IEDA shared services ensure broad discovery and persistent access of data submitted by both individual investigators and data acquisition facilities; and it maintains a close liaison with the science community to ensure that its services are aligned with the practices and requirements of its users. Key components of the IEDA system include repositories for file-based resources; a registry and metadata catalog of geoscience samples; web applications for data submission and sample registration; synthesis datasets for global seafloor topography and geochemistry; user interfaces for text-based and map-based data discovery and access; support for machine clients to submit and access data and metadata; and software for data visualization and exploration. IEDA also provides tools for data management planning and reporting to assist investigators with NSF data management policies. Global seafloor topography and solid-earth geochemical data are processed and synthesized for consistency and completeness, made accessible through web sites and web services, and are included as data layers in IEDA's data exploration software GeoMapApp. IEDA data curators review file-based data submissions for metadata quality to ensure that documentation is sufficient to support future reuse. Long-term archives for IEDA data consist of NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information or the Columbia University Long-Term Archive for data preservation. IEDA uses open-source, standards-based technologies to promote interoperable systems for exchanging data and information and foster next-generation geoscience research."

This award to the American Mathematical Society, with subcontract to CBMS, supports CBMS in its efforts to publicize conferences and administer the resulting publications, fostering greater dissemination of material related to cutting edge-topics and increasing the impact of the conferences in the community. Participation in the individual conferences is supported through separate NSF awards to host institutions.<br/><br/>The purpose of the NSF/CBMS conference series is to promote research in areas of the mathematical sciences that have recently seen significant new results and that hold promise for continued significant development. A conference achieves that purpose by having the principal lecturer, who is both a major researcher in the area of the conference and an excellent expositor, deliver ten lectures over a five-day period to the participants. The lectures typically cover the recent development of the field and chart possible new directions and open problems. Thus the format of the conferences is primarily educational, but at the research level. Approximately one-half of the participants at these conferences are graduate students and postdoctoral researchers; the conferences give them a good perspective on both the current research and interesting open problems in an important area of the mathematical sciences. The lecturer agrees to prepare a substantial expository monograph based upon his or her lectures. The resulting monograph reaches a broader audience and provides an introduction to readers who wish to begin research in the field. Moreover, the conferences provide host institutions an opportunity to enhance their local research activity."

Over 5 years, the project will produce 20 new teachers who have STEM baccalaureate degrees and are prepared to teach in high-need school districts.  The project will first recruit high-achieving sophomore or junior students who are majoring in STEM disciplines; these students will become Noyce interns.  All Interns will participate in a sponsored 10-week summer program involving original research under the guidance of a mentoring team consisting of research scientists, a master secondary science teacher with research experience, and a science educator from the Experiencing Science Practices through Research to Inspire Teaching (ESPRIT) team.  In addition, these Noyce interns will be engaged in course work in promoting equity and diversity in schools, rigorous science coursework, teacher community-building activities, and an on-going ""Noyce seminar"" focused on integrating these experiences. In their senior year and post-baccalaureate year, Noyce Scholars will experience extensive supervised field work in high-need school districts and graduate with a master's degree, an initial Oregon teaching license (through UOTeach) and an ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) endorsement. In the process, the project will add to the production of University of Oregon (UO) science teachers, nominally doubling the annual production and tripling UO homegrown science teachers. <br/><br/>Individuals who are recruited and prepared through the Noyce Program will be uniquely qualified to take leadership roles in high-need schools serving groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields, especially English language learners. With their background in scientific research, science teaching preparation, and ESOL training, Noyce alumni will have the skills and resources to realize the vision of the Next Generation Science Standards, including engaging their students in authentic practices of scientists augmented by an emphasis on social justice. Consequently, these Noyce Scholars will have the potential to assist in the recruitment of the next generation of scientists in Oregon. The project's PIs will systematically study the impact of program activities on the recruitment, retention and teaching effectiveness of the Noyce Scholars. A primary goal is to inform the research on preparing teachers to engage students in science inquiry in high-need schools. For example, the teacher research experience coupled with acquisition of ESOL pedagogical skills prepares the Noyce Scholars to model the practices of scientists in high-need schools in a potentially transformative program."

This dissertation research will address ongoing theoretical debates and public discussions regarding punishment and work by foregrounding the structure of inmate work programs and the on-the-job experiences and understandings of inmates and prison staff members alike. It will move beyond questions of who is sent to prison in the first place or how offenders fare post-release; instead, this project contributes to an understanding of how penal labor practices impact different segments of the inmate population in the time between initial incarceration and eventual release, as well as implications for individuals? outcomes and aspirations. This research will provide novel insights into prison labor that may be useful to prison administrators and policymakers tasked with addressing these issues.<br/>Two central questions guide this research: (1) How are prison work programs and employment systems structured (i.e., what types of positions are available, how must inmates compete for assignments, what skills or qualities are prioritized in the prison labor market)? (2) How does this structure help shape the experiences, outlooks, and outcomes of working offenders? To address these concerns, this research draws on 18 months of ethnographic observations in prison work programs within one anonymous state prison in the US Sunbelt region, as well as 82 in-depth interviews with inmate laborers and prison staff members. Online and archival data detailing the characteristics of prisons and prison work programs throughout the Sunbelt region help situate findings from this field site in broader contexts. Much research on penal labor and its outcomes relies on quantitative analyses of aggregate trends or post-release reports from ex-offenders. This study provides a rigorous assessment of prison labor from the inside, utilizing sociological theories of the labor process, punishment, and social reproduction to help explain how nuanced experiences of work in prison may impact those behind bars. Findings contribute to carceral sociology, the sociology of work, and to prison and labor policy."

When signals across a wide frequency band are of interest, a fundamental tradeoff between sampling rate, amplitude quantization precision, cost, and power consumption is encountered. The investigators study low resolution sampling techniques with general thresholds, which are affordable, technically feasible, easy to apply, energy-efficient, and consistent with technological trends. The enormous gains in capacity and spectral efficiency, for example, that could be provided by a successful millimeter wave (mm-wave) massive multiple-input multiple output implementation could have a revolutionary effect on the performance of wireless systems nearly everywhere we use them: at home, at work, at school, commuting via public transportation or by plane, shopping, at restaurants, recreational venues, sporting events, and so on. Besides consumer applications, there are many military- and security-related scenarios where our systems could be used.<br/><br/>This project involves advancing fundamental knowledge in developing dynamic energy-efficient and cost-effective sampling techniques and applies engineering principles to address the critical needs of several important and related applications. Specifically, this project involves  addressing significant open questions, including deterministic identifiability, performance bounds, and impact of thresholding pattern on spectrum sensing and array processing, radio frequency interference mitigation, and mm-wave communications to gain fundamental insights into the novel paradigm of low resolution sampling with general thresholds, devising novel signal processing algorithms, including effective and efficient sparse signal recovery techniques and parametric maximum likelihood methods for enhanced performance, and evaluating and demonstrating the performance using measured data. This project also involves preparing students for engineering in the 21st century through the incorporation of practical design and problem-solving techniques into both the education curriculum."

While current scholarship views this history as a struggle for rights, British colonial subjects were being excluded from holding these rights. The formation of civil, political and social rights within Britain took place at a time when British settlers built a slave-empire in the Caribbean, implemented forced labor regimes across four continents, and controlled immigration. The purpose is to understand the politics of racial exclusion.  The study seeks to find the historical roots of the nation state's hostility towards immigrants and refugees. Analyzing the legacies of empire involved in the construction of the British nation state aims to shine a light on the deep-seated racial politics linking Europe and its former colonial others.<br/><br/>Even though historical sociology has long studied the formation of the modern nation state, existing explanatory mechanisms are largely endogenous to Europe and a spatial break between ""the nation"" and ""the empire"" has seeped into sociological analytical frameworks. The project addresses this analytical shortcoming and examines the making of modern Britain in interaction with the colonial British West Indies. It asks:  How did the British nation state form amidst a context of colonial empire? Specifically, research focuses on three historical moments in metropolitan and colonial British politics: The formation of civil rights amidst settler rights claims and slavery abolition; the formation of working class political rights amidst indentured labor regimes in the empire; and the formation of social rights during a time of colonial immigration. The study draws on government archival documents, colonial office communications and newspapers, and it has two objectives: First, it seeks to explain how and why the British metropolitan body politic came to be defined against colonial populations and created a citizenry that was imagined as white, normalizing the color line. Second, following the consolidation of the nation state, it aims to show how immigrating colonial subjects challenged the nation-building project and how a struggle over difference came to threaten the isomorphism between people, race and nation."

The intestine also can remodel its structure and function to match meal size, to accommodate changes in diet, and to compensate for loss due to disease or surgery, but little is currently known about the precise mechanisms that underlie this remodeling. The ultimate goal of this collaborative research is to identify the signaling and structural mechanisms that enable the vertebrate intestine to modulate structure and function. Rather than relying on traditional laboratory research animals to achieve this goal, this program takes advantage of the extreme ability of some snakes (pythons, boas, and rattlesnakes) to remodel their small intestine with each meal. By comparing the cellular and molecular responses of the small intestine to feeding and fasting among snakes that feed regularly versus sporadically, and between snakes and other vertebrates, coupled with available genomic resources, this research program will provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie intestinal remodeling in vertebrates. An exciting novelty of this research is the incorporation of non-traditional model species (i.e., snakes) that have the potential to reveal previously unknown or overlooked mechanisms and that may be important for driving new discoveries for the therapeutic treatment of intestinal diseases. The project's outreach components include workshops on the generation and analyses of gene expression data, and public lectures and animal-based exhibitions to local schools, camps, and museums.<br/><br/>Vertebrates possess the physiological capacities to alter intestinal performance that are adaptively linked to their feeding habits. For example, species that naturally experience long episodes of fasting between large meals (e.g., sit-and-wait foraging snakes) experience rapid upregulation of intestinal form and function with feeding, and subsequent intestinal atrophy and downregulation following digestion. In contrast, frequently feeding species (e.g., active-foraging snakes) experience only modest change in intestinal form and function with each meal. Currently unknown are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural and functional flexibility of the intestine, and whether such mechanisms are shared across vertebrates that widely or narrowly regulate intestinal performance. By leveraging the extreme range in intestinal responses exhibited by snakes and other vertebrates, and recently available genomic resources, this research program will identify the underlying mechanisms of intestinal flexibility and. test whether these mechanisms are shared across lineages and regulatory phenotypes. This goal will be accomplished by pursuing three aims: (1) identify the cellular and structural mechanisms that underlie the modulation of intestinal form, and whether form dictates the regulation of intestinal function; (2) link transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to phenotypic changes in intestinal structure and function; and (3) test whether shared or unique sets of molecular mechanisms drive similar phenotypic responses among vertebrates. Ultimately, this research will identify the signaling and structural mechanisms by which vertebrates modulate intestinal form and function."

Nucleic acids provide exceptionally information-rich architectures, and this capability can be harnessed for a variety of applications in biotechnology.  However, the molecules typically used in these applications are not suitable for use in biological environments, as they are rapidly degraded by enzymes. This proposal will explore non-natural nucleic acids that are not degraded in biological environments.  Importantly, these nucleic acids can also be functionalized to impart a diverse range of chemical properties.  In the proposed research, the modulation of these properties will be explored to control formation and disruption of nanoscale assemblies, which is anticipated to enable controlled binding and release of small guest molecules such as therapeutics.  This research project will span the fields of materials science, chemistry, and molecular biology, providing undergraduate and graduate students with a highly interdisciplinary training experience involving the use of cutting edge techniques.  This project will also contribute to public scientific literacy through a blog project implemented in a course taught by the PI, as well as through the PI's participation as a judge and student mentor for the high school International Science Fair.<br/><br/>Technical: This research project will explore amphiphilic peptide nucleic acids (PNA) as a new class of programmable materials capable of stimuli-responsive assembly, disassembly, and guest release.  PNA is an artificial nucleic acid having unique physicochemical properties, which can largely be attributed to the fact that it has an achiral, peptide-like backbone in place of the sugar-phosphate backbone found in native nucleic acids.  Specifically, PNA is not degraded by nucleases or proteases, and exhibits increased binding affinity with DNA and RNA.  Additionally, PNA can be synthesized having a functionally diverse array of side chains located at sequence-defined positions along the backbone.  <br/><br/>Synthesis and exploration of amphiphilic PNA strands in which side chains are strategically located to enable phase-driven self-assembly into micellar architectures will be studied.  Specifically, the project will (1) establish design rules for the assembly and guest binding properties of amphiphilic PNA sequences; (2) evaluate disassembly and guest release from PNA micelles in response to small-molecule and nucleic acid targets; (3) explore stimuli-responsive assembly of PNA amphiphiles to promote small-molecule release.  The broader impacts of the proposed research include activities aimed at improving undergraduate education and public scientific literacy, and the potential to benefit public health through the future development of improved diagnostics and drug delivery platforms."

Understanding the biology of host-parasite interactions, particularly at the genetic and molecular levels of analysis, is an important area of basic research because we lack an understanding of the principles of these interactions. Parasites with insect hosts must overcome insect innate immune defenses to be able to complete their life cycles, including development in the host and transmission. The molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, and the genetic basis for variation in these interactions, are not fully understood. This project focuses on understanding host-parasite interactions in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum to gain improved understanding of fundamental host-parasite interactions. The investigator has linked some host genetic variation with variation in the number of parasite life stages in the host, indicating variable immunity among individual insect hosts and therefore potentially differential ability to transmit the parasite. This researcher has developed a novel, computational approach to identify additional host genes associated with parasite infection, which enables the investigation of such genetic variation in immunity to parasites in natural populations of An. Gambiae, which can be more informative than studies in laboratory populations. The investigator will employ modern genomic, biochemical and computational methods in this study. This project will improve our knowledge base about the genetic basis of, and the molecular mechanisms of insect innate immunity against parasites, and more generally host-parasite interactions. An important broader scientific and societal impact of this study is improved understanding of the specific mosquito-parasite system that causes the disease malaria, which causes suffering and death in millions of people each year.<br/><br/>Genetic analyses have demonstrated that genetic variation in Anopheles gambiae is associated with the number of Plasmodium oocysts in mosquitoes. Identifying the genes associated with variation in infection intensity and understanding how they function are important in decoding the genetic and molecular basis of insect-parasite interaction. Targeting these genes will lead to novel approaches in controlling parasite transmission. However, it is difficult to determine causative mutations from ~300 million base pairs and ~15,000 genes in the mosquito genome using traditional approaches. In a recent, significant finding, the Principal Investigator and co-workers used a novel computational approach and identified approximately 1% of the An. gambiae genome that is enriched with genes related to P. falciparum infection in mosquitoes. This research project is aimed at analysis of these newly identified genomic regions to elucidate molecular mechanisms of insect-parasite interaction using the well-characterized An. gambiae populations and P. falciparum parasites from western Kenya. Direct association studies will be systematically conducted to detect genetic variations associated with P. falciparum infection intensity in wild A. gambiae populations from Africa. Then the relative role of the candidate mosquito genes on parasite invasion will be determined under laboratory conditions and in the wild in Africa. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of candidate genes will be investigated. The combination of computational approaches, molecular functional analyses in the laboratory, and field entomology studies is a very powerful set of tools to address insect-parasite interactions. This CAREER project will integrate research and education from K-12 to graduate students, locally, nationally and internationally. K-12 students and teachers will have opportunities to learn and participate in genomics research with the investigators in this study. Seminars on insect-parasite interactions will be provided in local schools and universities. The educational seminars will also be given to the communities in Kenya where P. falciparum infection is endemic. While undergraduate and graduate students play important roles in the research, the research program also provides materials and resources for education in classrooms. Ultimately, an outstanding research program coupled with an excellent genomics curriculum will be established."

At an algorithmic level, new methods to address the biological problems of genome-scale orthology inference and regulatory motif search are being developed. At a computational abstraction level, the researchers are designing an extended finite automaton abstraction suitable to support diverse computations, and are mapping new and existing computational kernels onto it. At a hardware mapping level, automatic tuning techniques for the effective deployment of automata-based computations on FPGA and Micron?s AP are being developed. <br/><br/>	This interdisciplinary project will facilitate the adoption of FPGA and Micron?s Automata Processor by biologists by providing a new library of pattern matching routines and a high-level automata-based programming interface for these platforms.

The research objectives of this CAREER grant are to investigate the environmental sustainability of next generation lithium ion batteries (NG LIBs) and to create a sustainability analysis tool for sustainable design and manufacturing of NG LIBs for battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs), collaborating with General Motors, Johnson Controls, and PE International. More specifically, the research objectives of this career grant include: (1) Modeling and investigations of NG LIB manufacturing emissions; (2) Experimental investigations of nano-particle emissions from NG LIB manufacturing through in situ and ex situ techniques; (3) Thermodynamic energy modeling and validation of NG LIB manufacturing; (4) Closed loop sustainability management of NG LIB technologies through recycling and sustainability analysis tool development. The long-term educational goal is to establish a comprehensive educational program on environmental sustainability of BEVs. To fulfill this goal, the educational objectives of this CAREER grant are to provide cutting-edge research-based knowledge and educational resources for environmental sustainability of NG LIBs. The educational plans of this proposal include: (1) Students' education and training through curriculum development and research participation; (2) Industrial professionals? education and outreach through industrial seminars, short course and conference seminars;(3) General public education and awareness through online videos, public radio programs and website downloadable materials. Major innovations of the project include the development of process-based mathematical models and tools validated through experimentation for understanding and improving the environmental sustainability of NG LIB technology. The project aims to lead to the development and application of NG LIB technology in large-scale industrial production with reduced environmental impacts and economic costs. NG LIB is under development using nanotechnologies which have significant sustainability issues in real production. Moreover, nano-wastes and nano-particle emissions from NG LIB productions may pose severe risks of exposure for both occupational and public health. In addition, NG LIB production is very energy-intensive, which contributes not only to the environmental impacts, but also to the high costs of NG LIB products. This project aims to reduce NG LIB manufacturing wastes and emissions (including nano-particle emissions), improve the energy efficiency, and enhance the sustainable development of NG LIB technology for future large-scale applications on EVs. Environmental sustainability performance of NG LIB technologies is significant and must be fully investigated and improved before large-scale application in future EVs. The research results will be broadly disseminated through academic journals, conference proceedings, internet media, etc., and will improve people's understanding about the potential environmental impacts of NG LIB technology and assist in developing a sustainable infrastructure for NG LIB production for EVs. In practice, the research results will be applied by industrial partners (GM and JC). The educational impact includes involving high school students and teachers, developing a new course on sustainable design and manufacturing, integrating the research results into two current UWM courses (enrolling more than 120 students/year), teaching a short course in the UWM School of Continuing Education for local and national industrial professionals, offering the course materials through UWM's online MS program, holding seminars at leading industrial companies (GM and JC) and premiere conference workshops (ISSST), sharing the materials in such national high-impact databases and websites as NSDL and NCLT, and offering video and public radio programs for the general public. This project will train one postdoc, one Ph.D. student and two undergraduate students (with the support of NSF REU and UWM SURF programs). Underrepresented students will be recruited from UWM student professional societies. The educational materials will be shared with the PI's collaborators in both the U.S. and China."

Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation in nature is also useful for increasing crop yields and for the conservation of wild species. One such challenge faced by organisms at high latitudes is freezing temperatures. This research investigates the genetics of freezing tolerance in the mouse-eared cress, a relative of many crop species that has become a ""model"" organism for which many genetic tools have been developed. In earlier work, the researchers collected seeds of this species from Italy and Sweden and planted them in experimental gardens located in each country. They found that freezing tolerance is required to survive the long, cold winters in Sweden, whereas freezing tolerance reduces performance in Italy. This result exemplifies the concept of biological ""trade-offs""; adaptation to one environment often reduces performance elsewhere. This simple principle can explain why there are so many different species on earth, in that each species is adapted to a particular environment. The research investigates the genetic control of freezing tolerance and explores the mechanisms that contribute to the tradeoff in performance across environments. The genetic mechanisms identified in these studies may be useful tools for producing new crop varieties with increased yield in cold climates. In addition, the research team will perform outreach activities that advance scientific literacy and promote careers in science. Michigan State University scientists will contribute to a partnership between K-12 teachers and the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station to develop lesson plans that support Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for inquiry based learning.<br/><br/>The research employs cutting edge genetic technologies to address the mechanisms and adaptive value of freezing tolerance using three complementary approaches. First, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be further examined in the two original populations in Sweden and Italy using new lines manipulating freezing tolerance genes in otherwise homogeneous parental backgrounds. These lines will then be grown in controlled environment chambers and in the field to estimate the importance of freezing tolerance genes for genetic trade-offs in performance across environments. Second, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be investigated in <br/>four new populations from Scandinavia and Spain with dramatic differences in freezing tolerance. Third, this research will be expanded to an even broader scale, asking if the same genes for freezing tolerance found in these focal populations are found in other geographic regions. The techniques employed in part three are similar to those used to study the genetics of many human diseases. Taken together, these studies examine the genetic basis of freezing tolerance in a broad diversity of natural populations and assess the mechanisms of performance trade-offs for this important adaptive trait."

However, storing the distance between every pair of nodes of a graph is infeasible, especially for today's ""big data."" Small sketches of a graph have been developed so that a good estimate of any pairwise distance can be retrieved from the sketch. This project aims to advance the state-of-the art of such sketches. The main objects of study are spanners, distance oracles and their fault-tolerant variants. A spanner is a sparse subgraph that does not stretch any distance of the original graph by much. A distance oracle is a data structure that has small space usage and is capable of answering (approximate) distance queries efficiently. Both spanners and distance oracles compress the distance information. The main difference between them is that one can still run graph algorithms on a spanner, but not on a distance oracle, whereas one can obtain any distance from a distance oracle instantly, but in a spanner one would have to actually compute it.<br/><br/>In practice, networks are dynamic in nature. To address this, graph sketches would have to tolerate faults, i.e. edge and vertex deletions. There are fault-tolerant versions of spanners and distance oracles-- these structures estimate distances for any given (typically fixed size) subset of failed edges or nodes. This project will provide algorithms for constructing new low-space spanners and oracles with improved guarantees and will strive to develop new techniques for fault-tolerance and distance estimation in general. Spanners and distance oracles have many applications, e.g. in parallel and distributed algorithms for distance computation, network routing, and simulating synchronized protocols in unsynchronized networks. A better understanding of network routing along short paths could guide the design of next-generation Internet protocols. The research is also closely tied to the field of metric embedding, and thus extends beyond the strict boundaries of computer science. Material from this research will be integrated into core undergraduate and graduate courses, and will lead to the development of new courses on the topic. The lecture notes and project materials will be available on the course website for the general public."

Such organizations typically have educational mandates and special educational value because they connect students directly to cutting edge STEM research and innovations. However, these organizations often have limited reach because curriculum distribution is a secondary priority. The curricula and resources they produce are ""siloed"" on individual websites and may not reach a broad audience. The Planetary Laboratory is a cost effective way for organizations to produce and distribute content that is aligned with national education standards for formal instruction and amenable to out of school learning. This will help organizations satisfy their 'broader impacts' goals, improve their ability to secure funding, and expose more students to STEM education materials that may be more effective than traditional text book based lessons.<br/><br/>The Planetary Laboratory will operate an online learning management system (LMS) that curates and hosts educational content from multiple organizations. The LMS will present this content in a way that aligns with national education standards and makes it easy for teachers and students (K12 in particular) to use. Each learning challenge (a set of multimedia materials that will guide the student through content on a specific topic) will connect users with a network of organizations that produce relevant curriculum. By linking related curricula and projects across organizations, this team will build larger networks of students/teachers and learning materials, which improves the reach of each individual organization. Content can be organized to cover different types of standards (e.g., Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core) across topic areas and grades.  The Planetary Laboratory will use organizations' content to create better STEM education programs for students. It will connect STEM learning with other educational goals, particularly literacy and social and emotional learning. The barriers that schools put between different types of learning (e.g., math class teaches math; reading class teaches literacy) do not exist in the real world. The Planetary Laboratory will help teachers break down these barriers and give students a better sense of how improving their literacy, or knowing how to manage their peer relationships, is relevant to scientific enquiry and STEM careers. It will also help teach more science at earlier ages - science education is often not emphasized until middle school even though it is relevant and teachable far sooner."

Of the 7.9 million cancer-related fatalities reported every year worldwide, over 90 percent are believed to be the result of metastatic disease, in which a subset of cells from the original tumor spread throughout the body.  The physical mechanisms employed by metastatic cancer cells to invade remain poorly understood.  During metastasis, cells from the primary tumor acquire characteristics that enable them to escape and migrate through a mechanically and chemically heterogeneous stromal environment to establish secondary tumors.  As cells migrate, they remodel the matrix by both degrading it and by using mechanical force to physically move fibers from their path.  Data suggest that degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix by ""leader"" cells enables the escape of additional cells from the primary tumor, termed ""follower"" cells.   In this project, the PI and collaborators will use tailored materials, microfabricated structures and approaches from cell and molecular biology to re-create the leader-follower dynamics found in vivo and probe the underlying mechanisms guiding leader-follower migration.  The two major educational goals in this project are to bring tissue engineering to the elementary and middle school classroom, and to incorporate undergraduate students from primarily 4-year, undergraduate schools in research.  The work will integrate the major research themes in this project into an inquiry-based, hands-on module that builds off of the PI's previous work with the Ithaca Sciencenter, a local ""please-touch"" children's science museum.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this project are the creation of a novel, microfabricated platform to study cell invasion and the identification of the molecular mechanisms guiding the metastatic migration of cells.

Despite their widespread adoption, these devices are still considered relatively difficult to use, in that they require the programmer to be familiar both with parallel programming and with the operation of the hardware. In particular, the effective deployment of irregular applications on many-core devices is still far from understood. However, many established and emerging applications (from social and computer networking, electrical circuit modeling, discrete event simulation, compilers, and computational sciences) are irregular in nature, being based on data structures such as graphs and trees. <br/>This research proposes compiler and runtime techniques to support the deployment of graph and other irregular applications on many-core processors, while hiding from the programmer the complexity and heterogeneity of the underlying hardware and software stack. Since the degree of parallelism within irregular applications is heavily data dependent, the proposed compiler techniques aim to generate multiple platform-specific code variants starting from high-level platform-agnostic algorithmic descriptions. The runtime techniques focus on the selection of the most appropriate code variant and its tuning to the hardware and the input datasets. More specifically, this research covers three important issues related to irregular applications: (i) the effective handling of nested parallelism (in the form of parallelizable nested loops and recursive functions) within irregular applications; (ii) the design of a dynamic memory allocation library that can scale to the degree of multithreading offered by many-core devices, and of graph encoding schemes suitable for applications operating on dynamic datasets; and (iii) the effective handling of synchronization on many-core devices."

As a typical example of on-demand economy, ride-sourcing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are transforming the taxi industry and the way we travel in cities. The companies provide ride-hailing applications that intelligently source private car owners who drive their own vehicles to provide taxi services for profit to riders. These companies have been successful, but have created controversy. This controversy arises due to regulations in terms of price, entry and service quality that are imposed on the taxis while comparatively fewer regulatory requirements have been imposed on ride-sourcing companies. Unfair competition is argued particularly by cab drivers and their employers. The success of ride-sourcing services has thus created doubt about the efficacy of regulating the taxi industry; it challenges the very premise behind regulation in this industry. This grant will develop methodologies and tools for analyzing the structure and competition of taxi markets with ride-sourcing services and deriving insights on their regulation. The grant will provide timely support for the government agencies of many cities to better understand the impacts and implications of ride-sourcing companies and develop policies to guide their deployment. The research results can also shed light on the analysis and management of other types of on-demand economy and other emerging urban mobility services such as car sharing and ridesharing. This grant will involve students at all levels and traditionally underrepresented students, creating interactive, virtual environments for in-class use.  Additionally, materials related to an on-demand economy and innovative urban mobility services will be developed to enhance existing courses. <br/><br/>The research will be conducted in two main thrusts. The first aims to develop an analytical framework to investigate optimal regulation regimes of a taxi market with ride-sourcing companies under simplified aggregate or macroscopic settings. Representing the matchings between customers and drivers by an exogenous matching function, the equilibrium properties of an aggregate taxi market will be examined under different market structures to derive insights on whether it is necessary or how to regulate the market. The aggregate model will be extended to network and dynamic contexts to better capture the spatial and temporal variability of the supply and demand of taxi services. The second thrust develops an agent-based simulation and a simulated test bed to provide a better understanding of the working mechanisms of ride-sourcing platforms, validate the analytical results obtained from developed models, and test various regulations and policies for more complex cases that are  analytically intractable. If successful, this grant will advance the knowledge of and analysis capabilities for taxi markets. It will enrich the literature of transportation systems analysis, network modeling and agent-based simulation and modeling."

The comparative case-study design examines citizens' perceptions of risks and associated place-protective actions across energy technologies, integrating public acceptance surveys with case-specific data about the type of energy technology and citizen proximities. The sample frame comprises natural gas and oil pipelines, high voltage power lines, natural gas electricity generation, and wind generation projects in the western US. Seven to nine historical siting cases will be selected for which publicly-available citizen and stakeholder contact information is available. Participants will be asked to complete online surveys about risk attitudes along with behavioral, demographic, and spatial data. Infrastructure Siting (In-Site) software  will be used. This software integrates an agent-based model of stakeholder dynamics with a Geographical Information System model that structures the agents- interactions based on demographic, engineering, and spatial data. The In-Site model simulates the emergence of community-based oppositional organizations, which have been surprisingly effective in delaying or blocking energy facilities projects. Spatial statistics and econometrics will complement the agent-based modeling and allow a comparative analysis of the underlying drivers of opposition across energy sectors and siting issues."

Unfortunately, many of the best protocols for multi-agent coordination problems suffer from scalability issues, that is, while they perform well when the number of agents is small or moderate, their performance degrades sharply as the number of agents in the network grows. This project will develop new control laws for a range of multi-agent problems whose performance is maintained even as network size becomes very large. A number of tasks with broad practical importance will be considered, including optimal distribution of limited resources among agents, cooperative tracking and estimation, and adaptive positioning for optimal sensing. With these new protocols, large groups of autonomous agents(such as mobile robots or unpiloted aerial vehicles) will be able to quickly accomplish a number of useful and important tasks. These advances are needed to allow emerging technologies for autonomous vehicles and other networked autonomous systems to realize their potential economic and societal benefits.<br/><br/>The main technical contribution will be to speed up a widely-used class of nearest neighbor interactions. It is common to optimize a global objective in multi-agent control by means of local updates that interleave the maximization local objectives with consensus terms that effectively couple these objectives. This project will develop techniques to speed up such consensus-like updates. By a judicious combination of weight-selection and extrapolation by each agent, the convergence time of consensus updates will be improved by one or several orders of magnitude. These speedups further imply quick convergence times for a number of multi-agent problems relying on consensus-like updates. The techniques applied mix recent advances from algebraic graph theory, optimization, switched dynamical systems, and the joint spectral radius."

The project will be integrated into outreach programs for community college, high school and grade school students.<br/><br/>This research will probe the structure and mechanism of action of the hyperactive insect antifreeze protein ApAFP752. The research will provide a better understanding of how antifreeze proteins interact with ice and provide cryoprotection to organisms that live in cold environments. The approaches are comprehensive and combine biochemistry, NMR spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy for both in vitro and in vivo studies and will utilize the synergy of the expertise of the investigators in these areas. This research project will be undertaken to (1) structurally characterize the antifreeze protein by NMR spectroscopy, (2) explore its water binding properties and interactions (e.g. hydrogen bonding), and (3) investigate its cryoprotective mechanism in Xenopus live cells. The comprehensive approach will provide unique insights into the underlying molecular mechanism of cryopreservation.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Experimental Program for the Stimulation of Competitive Research (EPSCoR)."

These technologies are lowering the cost of DNA sequencing by orders of magnitude and thereby enabling a variety of new applications.  These new applications, combined with the varying characteristics of the DNA sequences produced by these technologies, are increasing demand for efficient algorithms to interpret the resulting large volumes of DNA sequence data. The PI will develop a new class of robust algorithms for genome assembly and discovery of DNA sequence variants.  Some of these algorithms will rely on the availability of a closely related reference genome sequence, while others will operate de novo directly from the individual DNA sequences (i.e. reads) produced by a DNA sequencing machine.  In the latter case, the PI will design algorithms   that exploit longer range DNA sequence information available in newer single-molecule and nanopore sequencing technologies.  These algorithms will retain high sensitivity and specificity while scaling to billions-trillions of nucleotides and thousands of genomes. Finally, the PI will introduce combinatorial algorithms for the study of genome rearrangements in heterogeneous mixtures of DNA sequences.  Such mixtures arise in metagenomics or cancer genomics, where the DNA that is sequenced is a mixture of genomes from different species, or from cells harboring different mutations, respectively.  The PI collaborates closely with biologists and technology developers to ensure relevance and applicability of the algorithms.  At the same time, some of algorithms and techniques from graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and probability that are developed in the proposal are applicable to problems outside of biology. <br/>Broader Impact<br/>The proposed research will be integrated with an educational component that includes the development of undergraduate seminar in personal genomics, a summer research experience in computational biology for high-school students, and the incorporation of a computational biology module into a summer computing camp for 9th grade girls. The PI will continue to actively mentor and recruit undergraduate and graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities. Finally, software implementing the algorithms will be freely distributed to the scientific community through a public webserver."

As the pool of potential donors remains limited to patients at end of life with its associated infirmities, access to and availability of off-the-shelf, low cost, readily accessible and procurable human tissue-derived donor materials that can accelerate and promote bone repair for craniofacial, dental, orthopaedic, and plastic/reconstructive surgical procedures will remain a challenge for clinicians. As an alternative subcutaneous adipose tissue provides a readily accessible source of human donor material as many healthy individuals electively seek out plastic and reconstructive surgery to remove unwanted tissue via liposuction or abdominoplasty. While subcutaneous adipose provides a large volume of human donor material, potentially suited to many applications in regenerative medicine, the application to bone repair is currently limited by its lack of suitable mechanical and biological properties.  To address this issue a process for adipose tissue decelluralization and chemical modification has been developed to provide a biologically active extra cellular matrix (ECM) with tunable mechanical properties.  This project will explore the suitability of this material to support bone tissue growth and repair, both ex-vivo and in a mouse model as a function of the material crosslinking and mechanical stiffness.<br/><br/>Acellular ECM from adipose tissue has been demonstrated to accelerate the regeneration of soft tissues but a lack of predictable mechanical properties and integrity in vivo limit the application of these types of material for orthopaedic reconstruction. This project will address the need for a high volume, clinically available allogenic material for use in musculoskeletal reconstruction. As a primary objective the project will demonstrate that hybrid synthetic-acellular adipose ECM (adECM) biodegradable scaffolds have the potential to provide control over mechanical and biological properties modulating progenitor and stem cell fate. A secondary objective is establishing lipoaspirates from living donors as a potential allograft resource for repair of bone and related tissues. This research will provide critical insight into: (1) the role of substrate mechanics in stromal/stem cell differentiation and function; (2) mechanical characteristics, structural integrity and biodegradability of hybrid scaffolds with respect to ECM content; (3) pre-clinical utility of adECM and synthetic hybrids in bone regeneration using a murine spinal fusion model. In the proposed system, a well-described base catalyzed thiol-acrylate Michael addition will provide the basis for the hybrid synthetic/adECM hydrogel.  This system provides for scaffolds with a wide range of mechanical properties but nearly identical chemical composition. The detailed research tasks of the project are: (1) determine the mechanical properties and integrity of hybrid synthetic/adECM scaffolds with respect to adECM content. (2) Correlate hybrid adECM scaffold composition and mechanical properties with the fate and behavior of adipose derived stromal/stem cells (ASC), bone marrow derived MSC (BMSC) or stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in vitro. (3) Determine the osteogenic properties of hybrid adECM to repair a murine spinal fusion model in vivo either alone or in combination with ASC, BMSC or SVF."

This includes the development of algorithms that can be used to train co-robots from skilled human operators to efficiently perform complex tasks in the face of real-world uncertainty, and to guide novice operators in performing such tasks. The primary targeted application is the construction and farming equipment industry that includes complex co-robots such as excavators, wheel loaders, tractors, forage harvesters where there is a significant need to understand and improve human-robot collaborative learning.<br/><br/>There are significant scientific challenges in developing efficient algorithms for co-robots that can actively learn from skilled human operators by observing and posing appropriate queries to close the feedback loop between the co-robot and the human operator. This project addresses these challenges by systematically formulating and investigating focused problems to create efficient algorithms that can enhance collaborative human-robot learning. To achieve the goal, algorithms are designed to collaboratively learn latent subgoal structures from ill-defined complex tasks, real-time path planning and control algorithms are developed for co-robots to achieve the learned subgoals, and techniques are developed to provide operator skill specific task decomposition and motion execution guidance. In addition, the developed algorithms are corroborated by simulators, hardware experimentation on laboratory and field co-robots, and theoretical analysis.<br/>"

The focus of this work is to improve analysis of polymers and small molecules, for example, with applications in consumer goods quality control and pharmaceutical drug development. The inherent versatility, quantitative nature, and dynamic range of this analytical platform make it applicable to a wide range of chromatographic detection challenges. In conjunction with the scientific goals of the project, the award will also support the training and development of young scientists, particularly those students from traditionally underrepresented minorities. Furthermore, the group will continue participation in outreach activities within the local community, including an innovative Spanish language science outreach program developed in collaboration with the campus chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).<br/><br/>Modified sensor arrays for multiparametric separations can be applied to polymer characterization using tunable organic sensor surfaces, to pharmaceutical biologics validation using immune-affinity characterization, and to integrated on-chip separations with electrophoresis for a lab-on-a-chip devices. The current methods for the analysis of polymer and small molecules suffer from slow product validation and often require multiple analytical methods for complete characterization. This project seeks to simplify the validation process by incorporating rapid and chemically informative separations into a single device, representing a new capability for the separations field. Such a device will prove particularly important in the separation and analysis of the next generation of pharmaceuticals, including antibody-based therapeutics. Unlike more conventional small molecule drugs these biological therapeutics demand unique analytical characterization tools."

Micro- electrocorticography (ECoG) is the practice of using microelectrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. Recent advances in ECoG provide unique opportunities to observe large regions of the neural cortex at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, uncovering the structure of complex neural circuits is challenging. This interdisciplinary project develops methods for learning high-dimensional nonlinear systems with a particular focus on these systems as they arise in cortical networks and validates these techniques on state-of-the-art ECoG systems.<br/><br/>Three thrusts are considered: The first considers the general problem of state estimation in high-dimensional dynamical systems using decomposition methods including distributed Kalman and particle filtering and graphical models. The main goal is to provide computationally scalable and flexible approaches with provable guarantees. The second combines these state estimation methods with Bayesian parameter estimation and compressed sensing techniques to identify connectivity and nonlinear dynamics in the networks. The third validates these methods on identification of neural models from ECoG arrays. Applications to neural mapping, auditory and visual stimuli decoding are explored. In particular, the project seeks to demonstrate the method on using recordings from rat primary auditory cortex and cat visual cortex using a novel, flexible, high-resolution electrode array."

The project tracks and compares 1,800 low-income students (900 students randomly selected to receive additional financial support with 900 students with similar economic backgrounds who do not receive additional support).  The randomized control study tests three hypotheses associated with the assumption that financial aid assists in student degree completion.  Hypothesis One:  Additional financial aid will reduce the number of hours spent working and the number of students working more than 20 hours per week will decline.  Hypothesis Two:  An increase in financial aid will stimulate an improvement of the quality of study time and that this will lead recipients to attempt more credits in STEM and achieve higher grades.  Hypothesis Three: Additional funding will permit recipients to increase their participation in STEM enrichment activities."
