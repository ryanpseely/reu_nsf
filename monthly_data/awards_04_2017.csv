This region is unique in Central America because of its lack of active volcanism, its extreme (and geologically recent) high elevations, and its history of unusually distributed large earthquakes. <br/><br/>The project will use resources of the University of Costa Rica: The School of Geology and the civil engineering research center (Laboratorio Nacional de Materiales y Modelos Estructurales, LanammeUCR,), and also the research facilities of the national power company of Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE).<br/><br/>Over the course of three years, 18 undergraduate students will participate in the project. They will collect new data on seismic wave propagation, gravity field strength, and the shape of the Earth's surface. They will  merge new observations with existing data into a unified knowledge base to increase understanding of the region. They will analyze combined data sets to answer specific questions about this region, such as ""Why are Cordillera Talamanca so high?"", ""Where are zones of present internal deformation?"", and ""What factors control slope stability?"", and use newly gained knowledge to assess landslide hazards along the Pan-American highway in the CT. <br/><br/>Integration of the GREAT project into the university-wide Aresty Research Assistant program will raise the visibility of Earth Sciences at Rutgers, making participation of historically underrepresented groups more likely. Assessment of the program's outcomes will be helpful in devising future efforts aimed at expanding participation of US diverse student population in natural science research. <br/><br/>The international collaborations forged during the project will establish institutional links between a large US public university (Rutgers) and the premier research and educational institution in Central America (University of Costa Rica).  <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>The Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca (GREAT) research and education project will pursue three distinct research avenues.<br/><br/>1.	We will study the interior structure of the Cordillera Talamanca region through a combination of gravity and seismic methods. Improved constraints on the distribution of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes. We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.  <br/><br/>2.	We will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c) using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  <br/><br/>3.	We will investigate the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.<br/><br/>During each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in the country. Students will collect new data and perform basic data processing and analysis tasks while in Costa Rica, and will develop individualized research projects over the course of subsequent academic year, when they will be enrolled in a university-wide Aresty Research Assistantship program."

His goal was to understand the scaling properties of the eigenvalues of random matrices to get insight about the spectrum of certain operators arising from the study of heavy nuclei. In the last half century, random matrices found applications in a wide range of areas both within mathematics (e.g., combinatorics, number theory, and the study of interacting stochastic systems) and various other fields as well (e.g., information theory, financial mathematics, and RNA-folding). In the recent years, a new characterization has been established for limit laws of random matrices via the spectra of certain random self-adjoint differential operators. This provides a new connection between random matrices and self-adjoint operators more than half a century after Wigner's original idea. This research project explores this new area.<br/><br/>This project builds on recent results of the investigator and collaborators on random operator representations of scaling limits of random matrices. The aim is to study the resultant random operators in order to learn more about the limit point processes.  Questions under study include the application of the classical theory of differential operators to random matrices, the study of operator level convergence results for random matrix models with quantitative error bounds, and the investigation of the connection between random matrix limits and diffusions in the hyperbolic plane. The project also includes investigations related to the study of the large-scale behavior of interacting stochastic systems. It is conjectured that a wide family of one-dimensional interacting stochastic systems share an unusual scaling behavior with limit distributions related to random matrix theory; this is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.  The investigator intends to explore various models belonging (or conjectured to belong) to the KPZ universality class, with a special focus on directed polymers, a model describing random paths in a space-time environment that is also random."

As our REU site will include participation of students from underrepresented groups or diverse backgrounds (i.e., rural, first-generation, ethnic or cultural minority, women), we have an opportunity to potentially assist the career trajectories of these students, including enriching their graduate school prospects, career paths, and career options.  <br/><br/>There are 4 aims for undergraduate students who participate in this REU: (1) gain experience conducting an independent project in the realm of treatment-related research for youth with SEB; (2) have educational experiences alongside research experiences that will allow them to become better data scientists; (3) be mentored in the requisite skills to apply to and get into top-notch graduate schools in research-related fields; and (4) gain unique experience transferring clinical research findings from science to practice and from practice to science. Two types of activities, research and educational, will allow these aims to be met. The research conducted by students with their mentors will advance understanding of treatments and treatment-related issues for children with SEB. With regular and frequent contact with mentors, students learn all aspects of the research process, including hypothesis formulation, integration and analysis of scientific literature, research design, data collection, data analysis, and the presentation of research findings. Students also attend seminars focused on statistics, research methods, and preparing for the graduate school application process. To maximize exposure to multiple areas of research, they attend seminars in which faculty mentors present data from recent research. Students receive considerable training in the presentation of research findings and have opportunities and financial support to present their findings at regional and national conferences focused on school mental health, treatments, and treatment-related concerns for youth with SEB. Students and mentors work together to submit research reports for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals."

In recent years, there has been a recognition that such effects can be employed in cooling, for example, in air-conditioning or refrigeration, and that these magnetic cooling technologies can potentially even replace more conventional ways of cooling involving compression/expansion cycles. This fundamental study of the structure of known and new materials as they are exposed to changes in the temperature and the strength of the magnetic field is carried out with funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program. The goal of this project is to identify how known materials can be expected to perform in useful devices, as well as inform the search for new and improved materials that could lead to further improvements in efficient cooling. Estimates are that cooling technologies consume as much as a fifth of the total energy used. Better materials and a better understanding of processes for cooling, both of which are target goals of this project, are therefore of national interest in terms of the US staying at the forefront of this important emerging technology. <br/><br/>Part 2: Technical<br/><br/>Changes in the temperature of magnetic materials due to applied magnetic fields were noted as long ago as 1881, the huge interest in the utility of this effect in employing magnetocaloric materials for cooling near room temperature is however more recent. While paramagnetic materials can be employed for cooling at very low temperatures, for applications near room temperatures and for applications of modest magnetic fields, the strongest effects are observed in materials close to their ferromagnetic Curie temperatures. The systems of interest in this project are 3d transition-metal based ferromagnets with Curie temperatures near room temperature. The main focus of the proposed work is on materials with structure types derived from the aluminum diboride structural aristotype, and are characterized by their ability to host two magnetic atoms. Typically, one of the two magnetic atoms is manganese. In many magnetocalorics, the magnetic transition appears to be associated with a structural change. To investigate this further, this research is guided by answering the following two questions: (i) How do the crystal structures change as ferromagnetic transitions are traversed with magnetic field or by cooling through the transition temperature, and what are the implications for magnetocaloric cooling? and (ii) Can metamagnetic transitions (i.e. spin-state transitions) be designed into materials in such a way that the entropy change associated with turning on a magnetic field is enhanced? The experimental aspect of the research focuses on known magnetocaloric materials as well as the discovery of new ones. Density functional theory-based methods are employed to co-design material compositions."

Currently, however, no research-based models are available to guide the development, characterization, and assessment of young children's algebraic thinking, particularly at the start of formal schooling. This study will design a curricular framework for developing children's algebraic thinking across Grades K-2, with a particular focus on understanding how to support the teaching and learning of algebra with students in at-risk settings. Study outcomes will include a prototype Grades K-2 instructional sequence, related assessments, and characterizations of progressions in students' thinking as they advance through the instructional sequence. The impact of this work would be to provide a critical roadmap for teaching and learning algebra in Grades K-2 that can clarify and deepen the role of algebra in the elementary grades, strengthen current college and career readiness standards and practices, and provide curricular support for elementary teachers in systematically developing children's algebraic thinking.<br/><br/>The study will use design research to develop and empirically test a K-2 Early Algebra Learning Progression prototype for diverse learners. The context for this study is a North Carolina elementary school, which consists of a student population that is 64% non-white, with 63% categorized as low SES and 27% as English Language Learners. The sample consists of approximately 60 Grades K-2 students. To empirically test the prototype's framework, learning goals, and instructional sequence, classroom teaching experiments (CTEs) will be conducted in conjunction with individual student interviews. These interviews will be conducted at three time points (pre, mid, and post) during the CTEs. Qualitative methods of analysis will be used to identify themes regarding children's understanding of core algebraic thinking practices and concepts in CTE and interview data. Quantitative methods will also be used to identify patterns of growth in students' algebraic thinking from interview data. Results will be used to refine the framework, goals, and sequence, as well as to identify levels of sophistication in children's thinking as they advance through the sequence. Interview assessments conducted during the CTEs will be analyzed for psychometric soundness to ensure they are valid and reliable. In particular, inter-rater reliability measures will be used to ensure that coding of interview data is consistent, internal consistency estimates of reliability will be calculated and used to remove or modify items, and stability of the assessment items will be examined through within-subject correlations of common items and used to remove or modify items. For validity, observed item difficulty will be correlated with predicted item difficulty by the project's expert advisory board to identify items that need modification or deletion.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

When that right is violated, anonymity-preserving technologies can provide a safety net. Anonymity-preserving systems are specifically designed to prevent adversaries from linking users to their actions within the system; most online services today are not designed to protect anonymity.<br/><br/>This project studies the anonymity properties of networked systems in which users broadcast sensitive information over a network. It considers two representative applications: anonymous microblogging and cryptocurrencies. Anonymous microblogging refers to social networks where users broadcast messages over a social graph; examples include Yik Yak and Whisper. Cryptocurrencies are distributed, digital currencies that allow a community to collectively, cryptographically verify the legitimacy of transactions; Bitcoin is the most successful example. Both anonymous microblogging platforms and cryptocurrencies broadcast sensitive messages over a network and are generally perceived as systems that protect user anonymity. This project aims to understand, from first principles, the vulnerabilities of existing broadcasting protocols against statistical deanonymization attacks, and whether such attacks can be prevented by carefully designing new protocols. Additionally, the project will develop open-source implementations to demonstrate the key theory including a distributed anonymous messaging application and a lightweight upgrade to Bitcoin's networking stack. The project also includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in this important research area.<br/><br/>The project is conducted in three steps. The first step is model-building which extracts simple, canonical mathematical models that capture the essence of these complex systems. The second step is source detection, where an adversary performing statistical inference to deanonymize the source of a broadcast is considered, and the mathematical models from step 1 are used to analyze the vulnerability of current protocols. The final step focuses on source hiding where the aim is to design novel broadcasting and network-management protocols that give provably-optimal anonymity guarantees while maintaining high utility for the target applications."

Nowadays persistent phosphors emitting in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges are being used in daily life, e.g., security signs, emergency route signs, traffic signage, dials and displays, and medical research. However, the widespread use of persistent phosphors is greatly hindered because of the need of high-energy excitation light, mostly ultraviolet light, to charge the materials. Therefore, solutions to achieving effective excitation with low-energy light, particularly the visible light, are in demand. This project investigates a new charging process that enables low-energy visible-light sources (e.g. laser diodes) to be as effective as the commonly used high-energy ultraviolet light sources (e.g. ultraviolet lamps) in charging persistent phosphors. The outcomes of this research have a potential to open new strategies for studying and utilizing persistent phosphors. The project provides an interdisciplinary training experience to graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students in luminescent materials research and applications. The undergraduate and K-12 education is implemented through the existing programs at University of Georgia, such as the NSF-sponsored Peach State-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, NSF-sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates sites, and Young Dawgs program (for K-12 education).<br/><br/>Technical Description: It is a general knowledge in persistent luminescence that high-energy ultraviolet light is usually necessary in order to effectively charge a persistent phosphor. However, the need of high-energy excitation compromises some applications where the ultraviolet light is unavailable or unsuitable. This project aims to tackle this limitation by investigating a new, two-photon up-conversion charging (UCC) process where low-energy visible-light sources (e.g. laser diodes) are as effective as the commonly used high-energy ultraviolet light sources (e.g. ultraviolet lamps) in charging persistent phosphors. In the UCC concept, two visible photons from a visible-light laser diode are successively absorbed by a UCC enabling ion (e.g. trivalent chromium ion) so that the high-energy delocalization state of the ion is reached and the electron traps in the phosphor are filled. The UCC enabling ions include trivalent chromium, divalent manganese, quadrivalent manganese, trivalent praseodymium, and trivalent neodymium. Several power-tunable visible-light laser diodes with wavelengths in the range of 400-700 nm are used as the excitation sources. New optical measurement techniques for UCC, such as UCC excitation spectroscopy, are under development in order to acquire spectral data that are essential for understanding the energy absorption, electron transfer, electron trapping and de-trapping processes involved in the UCC."

Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate. These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis. The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants. Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea. Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea. The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals. In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate interest in science and forge new international collaborations.<br/>"

Some of the most widely used polymers are associative polymers, including those used to make golf balls, the absorbing gels in diapers, flow modifiers for shampoos or conditioners, and new materials being developed for biomedical uses and enhanced oil recovery.  The use of these existing materials and the development of new systems relies on understanding how the molecules move:  how they are processed into the shape of a final object and how they deform under mechanical force.  Ultimately, these properties are governed by the way that the molecules move on microscopic scales.  Recently researchers have discovered that molecular motion in associative polymers shows unexpected relationships between how fast a molecule moves and the distance that it moves, prompting a reconsideration of some of the scientific understanding behind the design of the polymer properties.  This project will use specialized X-ray and laser light techniques to study associative polymer motion at the micro and nanoscale, allowing us to further understand the mechanisms by which they move.  Theory and simulation of these systems will be applied to relate molecular properties to the chemical design of new polymers, providing fundamental insight that allows faster discovery of improved polymeric materials.  A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate researchers will apprentice through this project, developing scientific expertise that will contribute to the U.S. economy.  The discoveries in this project will be shared with the public through YouTube and scientific publications and presentations and will also be developed in collaboration with high-school teachers into new materials to inspire the creativity and inventiveness of young students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  <br/><br/>The study of associative polymers has led to a solid theoretical understanding based on transient network theory for telechelic polymers, which models the dynamics of the networks based upon kinetic equations that model bond association and dissociation during deformation.  These concepts have also led to the development of sticky Rouse and sticky reptation theories, grounded in the same conceptual framework but applicable to polymers with associating groups spaced along the backbone.  Rheological measurements on a huge variety of associative polymer systems have established the validity of these approaches, at minimum in a qualitative sense.  However, these theories have not been similarly tested using experimental measurements of diffusion dynamics.  Recent diffusion measurements performed using forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS) show something that is not anticipated by any of the theories:  an apparent super-diffusive regime on length scales 10-1000 times greater than Rg, even though the gels show no signs of structure at this scale.  Similar behavior has now been observed in four separate systems, suggesting it is common across many polymers.  It is hypothesized that this super-diffusive regime is due to molecular ""jumping"" or ""hopping"" as the dominant diffusion mechanism at long length scales, something that is not anticipated in existing theories.  Preliminary Brownian dynamics simulations performed on a simplified associative polymer model for center-of-mass diffusion show that this hypothesis produces diffusion results that qualitatively match the FRS measurements.  Throughout the proposal, effects of molecular design will be systematically explored using FRS and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), both in experiments and using simplified coarse-grained models.  Because of the ubiquitous nature of associative polymers in applications and the key importance of dynamics in these materials for their end use, the potential for fundamental scientific insight provided by the proposed work will be large across many different industries and technology areas, ranging from oil recovery to lubricants to medicine to food.  To share with the broader community excitement about the interesting physics of these everyday materials, a series of educational videos will be made for YouTube that explain different aspects of the experiments and theory as they develop.  In the final year of the project, a collaboration will start with a high-school teacher to develop an educational model that combines the videos with simple lab rheology experiments to introduce students to the concepts of associative polymers."

A related theme is to develop foundational tools to study new families of L-functions, including a Petersson formula for newforms of arbitrary level.  Such tools are necessary to advance the analytic method for studying the representation problem for ternary quadratic forms. In addition, the investigator will study different aspects of the equidistribution of automorphic forms, such as restricted quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) as well as QUE in higher rank settings.

Lending devices is risky, however, because of the amount of personal information they store and the lack of good tools for managing access to that information.  This leads lenders to closely monitor borrowers' use, or to not lend the devices at all, both of which limit the usefulness of device lending and can lead to awkward interactions.  This project will develop mechanisms to provide lenders with better control over the functions and data that borrowers can use, exploring two main ideas.  The first is to use smartwatches, which are increasingly common, to support unobtrusive remote control of loaned smartphones.  The second is to use modular designs, in which the data is stored on a base unit and features are provided through detachable modules.  When separated, the modules enter a 'guest mode' where they can communicate with the base to access needed functions such as location or cellular network services, but are unable to access the owner's personal data.  This work will extend knowledge of how to develop miniature and modular technologies designed to be used by multiple people while protecting privacy.  The project will also provide PhD and undergraduate students opportunities to gain interdisciplinary research experiences, and open-source software and hardware prototypes that can be taken up by other researchers, designers, and makers.  <br/><br/>The work will proceed in three main stages.  The first stage will explore the privacy needs and interaction techniques around using a smart watch as the base unit for a smart phone.  Through deploying prototypes with varying levels of guest access, the researchers will determine the common kinds of privacy requirements associated with common lending tasks.  They will then design and evaluate the usability of unobtrusive interaction techniques, such as which hand a device is loaned with or the orientation of the device, for specifying privacy settings when the device is lent.  The second stage will focus on designing modular smartphone systems such that the phone's functions are naturally divided among modules to balance usability and privacy concerns.  For this stage, the researchers will start with focus groups using mock-ups to do requirements analysis aimed at determining how features can best be allocated to modules to support lending while still providing lenders with useful functionality.  They will then develop physical prototypes that realize these requirements and, as with the first stage, design and evaluate the usability of unobtrusive mode-switching interactions, such as the direction or order in which modules are detached.  Finally, inspired by prior work on dual-face smartwatches and the goal of continued miniaturization of computing devices, the researchers will marry the first two thrusts, designing modular smartwatch prototypes and the appropriate interaction techniques for managing access to them."

Partial differential equations provide a rigorous mathematical description of many important physical, ecological, and economical theories (e.g., Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Black-Scholes model of option pricing in finance). They are studied both analytically and numerically in order to determine the long-term behavior of solutions and their dependence on initial data. In many cases, physically meaningful concepts, such as energy, mass, and momentum, play important roles, since having good control of these quantities may enable one to prove that solutions exist globally in time and to study their behavior. However, it is of great interest to study equations (called energy-supercritical) for which such quantities are insufficient to govern the solution. This class of highly nonlinear equations includes many famous and important ones that arise from modeling physical phenomena (e.g., Einstein's equations, the Navier-Stokes equation, the Yang-Mills equations, and Euler's equations).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to understand, as far as possible, the behavior of ""large"" solutions to wave equations of supercrticial type, about which little is currently known. The principal investigator's potential contribution to the subject is based on two methods: (1) splitting solutions into incoming and outgoing parts and (2) a comparison principle for the wave equation. His preliminary results apply only to some (canonical) model cases, but seem promising. It will be interesting to generalize them to the nonradial case, to all dimensions, and to other types of nonlinearities and equations. One objective of the project is to take techniques (comparison principles, sub- and supersolutions) specific to the study of elliptic and parabolic equations and apply them in a meaningful way to the supercritical wave equation. The author's approach is different from those of Kenig and Merle and of others (Tao, Krieger and Schlag, Li, Wang and Yu). It leads to unconditional results and to sharp scattering criteria in several cases. Another avenue of investigation is that of linear and nonlinear evolution equations driven by time-dependent potentials. The potential can be deterministic or random (e.g., Brownian motion). This has clear applications to the study of soliton stability and some physical problems. The methods that the principal investigator has introduced, such as a structure formula for wave operators and the use of an abstract Wiener theorem to prove dispersive estimates, provide an improved way of looking at such equations, by allowing a more general time dependence of the potential, and permit stronger conclusions to be reached."

Such systems are comprised of a large number of particles in random motion and are best described by the Boltzmann and related kinetic equations. In practical applications, there are many sources of uncertainties that can arise in kinetic systems: imprecise measurements for initial and boundary conditions, incomplete knowledge of the fundamental interaction mechanism between particles, and so on. Understanding the impact of these uncertainties is critical to the simulations of the complex kinetic systems, and will allow scientists and engineers to obtain more reliable predictions and perform better risk assessment. Due to the unique challenges arising in kinetic equations, such as multiple scales, high dimensionality, and positivity, very few existing generic uncertainty quantification (UQ) algorithms can be applied directly. To bridge this gap, the research objective of this project is to develop highly efficient stochastic and multiscale numerical methods for Boltzmann-like kinetic equations. A parallel educational objective is to create innovative opportunities for students at all levels to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and promote career interest in these disciplines, especially among female students. <br/><br/>Specifically, we will pursue four research and educational aims: 1) develop stochastic asymptotic-preserving methods for multiscale kinetic equations; 2) construct high performance stochastic algorithms for the Boltzmann collision operator; 3) design physics-preserving UQ algorithms for kinetic systems; and 4) create education and outreach activities for students through undergraduate STEM classroom innovation; graduate curriculum development in kinetic theory; graduate and undergraduate mentoring; and organizing an after-school math research program for high school girls and family math/science nights at middle and elementary schools."

Many of these molecules are chiral, which means that they exist as non-superimposable mirror images.  These mirror image structures often behave differently in biological systems. For example, chiral pharmaceuticals typically show different efficacy depending on which mirror-image structure is administered.  Given their importance in biological and biomedical applications, it is therefore crucial to prepare these molecules as a single chiral structure, also known as an enantiomer. However, methods to prepare the desired enantiomer of many molecules are limited, and this curbs the discovery of potential medicines and biological probes. In this project, Dr. Mary Watson is developing a strategy using catalysts for the synthesis of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds that will allow the efficient synthesis of molecules that are currently difficult to prepare as single enantiomers. The catalysts are themselves single enantiomers, and she is also studying the fundamental interactions between the catalyst and the organic substrates to enable broad understanding of the mechanism of these reactions, and especially how the chirality of the catalyst is ultimately conveyed to that of the chiral product. Dr. Watson is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon her research to provide opportunities for students of all levels to engage in science.

The individual projects cover organic, metalorganic and physical chemistry aspects of catalysis are designed to interface the research interests of faculty members at the two participating universities. They incorporate a large number of new concepts such as a) new privileged ligand scaffolds that allow the precise positioning of directing groups, e.g. for nitrogen transfer reactions, b) new types of gold-catalyzed reactions such as photoredox catalysis without a secondary metal, c) novel ligands for the stabilization of biomimetic high-valent metals in catalysis and (d) the study of elementary reaction steps of important catalytic reactions such as metathesis or epoxidation reactions at the single molecule level. Their unifying principle is a rigorous structure- and mechanism-based approach whereby a range of advanced experimental and computational tools are used to generate a hypothesis, which is then tested experimentally in an iterative and accelerated fashion."

The original data from which the tree was derived may be composed of a combination of imaging data cubes (3D volumes), 2D images, and quantitative (tabular) data.  A useful technique for the visual exploration of such related data sets is linked views in which equivalent data is visually highlighted in each individual visualization.

The contributions of this proposal are applicable to many domains including and beyond healthcare.  The new tools and taxonomies developed as part of this research, along with tutorials and syllabi, will be made freely available and shared through conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>The research presented in this proposal will advance the state of the art in visualization through the creation of new techniques, methodologies, and taxonomies for tree diagrams. The results of the research will enable the effective design of interactive tree diagrams in a multidimensional context based on the required analytic tasks in a novel and systematic approach. The full project from taxonomy abstractions to visualization and editing techniques and methodologies to an implemented system with an evaluation case study and user testing provides a model approach to visualization research.  The following research questions will be addressed as part of the proposed work: (1) How does one pick the optimal tree diagram type based on data type and analytic task? and (2) What are the best methods for interacting with tree diagrams including how to select data?  To answer these questions a new taxonomy for tree diagrams will be created in order to take into account the concepts of data type, data dimensionality, quantitative data encoding options, and task.   In order to enable the ability to develop linked views with tree diagrams, a new task taxonomy for tree diagrams will be created including data selection methods for tree diagrams.  The taxonomies and related methodologies for tree diagrams will be implemented into an interactive publicly available tool enabling a user to select or invent the most appropriate tree diagram for their data and set of tasks, and then interact with it in a linked-view data visualization and exploration environment for visualizing and analyzing multidimensional datasets.  In order to evaluate the new taxonomies and methodologies as well as the usability of the new tool incorporating these concepts, a real world case study and usability evaluation will be conducted in the healthcare field of brain imaging with the goal of investigating and developing a novel tree diagram representation of brain blood vessels."

This is particularly pressing for amphibians, many of which are threatened by temperature-dependent emerging diseases. One challenge in predicting temperature effects on parasitism is that both host and parasite have independent responses to temperature, and these responses are difficult to disentangle with infection experiments. To help solve this problem, this project will test a new Metabolic Theory (MT) based approach to modeling parasite-host interactions in variable-temperature environments. MT postulates that metabolic rates govern all biological rates, leading to the prediction that all physiological processes within a given organism should respond to temperature in similar ways. This means it should be possible to estimate key model parameters for the temperature-dependence of parasite infectivity or host resistance to infection, by measuring the temperature-dependence of metabolic proxies like parasite growth in culture or host respiration. This approach could be especially valuable for predicting temperature effects on multi-host pathogens like the amphibian chytrid fungus, because it is impossible to conduct infection experiments for every species threatened by this disease. These funds will also help to support: (1) a new thermal-physiology classroom lab activity for use in Introductory Biology and Project Upward Bound's summer academy, (2) an annual summer workshop to train graduate teaching assistants and early-career faculty in modern teaching methods, and (3) at least four graduate students and over a dozen undergraduate student researchers.<br/><br/>This project will test assumptions and predictions of a new Metabolic Theory (MT) based approach to modeling parasite-host interactions in variable-temperature environments, using chytrid fungus in amphibians as a model host-parasite system. Thermal performance curves for parasite infectivity and host resistance will be described using modified Sharpe-Schoolfield equations, and key model parameters (e.g., activation energies for parasite infectivity and host resistance) will be estimated by measuring the temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolic proxies. These separate thermal performance curves will then be combined into a predictive model for parasite growth rates on hosts, and maximum-likelihood statistics will be used to estimate remaining model parameters. To model thermal acclimation effects, key parameters will be allowed to vary as functions of host or parasite acclimation temperatures. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to test the core assumption that different organisms and physiological processes have similar values and thermal acclimation responses for key MT model parameters, (2) test the ability of MT based models to predict parasite transmission in variable-temperature environments, and (3) delve into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying thermal acclimation effects on host-parasite interactions. To achieve the third goal, we will measure effects of temperature and thermal acclimation on (5) cellular immune activity and (6) gene expression responses to chytridiomycosis infection. We will replicate experiments using arrays of custom-built experimental incubators and temperature-controlled outdoor mesocosms."

They have applications ranging from industrial waste-heat recovery, to remote sensing, to space exploration. High efficiency thermoelectric materials need to simultaneously exhibit high electrical conductivity, a large Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. This combination of properties is exceptionally difficult to achieve. Materials with highly anisotropic crystal structures offer a potential strategy to increase the thermoelectric efficiency, because their physical properties display different values when measured along different crystallographic directions. The goal of the research funded by this award from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program is to develop a powerful and adaptable method for single crystal growth of compounds with complex, anisotropic crystal structures. Characterizing these large crystals advances our understanding of the fundamental connection between the atomic structure of materials and the anisotropic thermal and electronic behavior, providing routes to enhanced thermoelectric efficiency. This interdisciplinary and collaborative project utilizes facilities at the NSF-supported PARADIM Materials Innovation Platform. With this Solid State and Materials Chemistry funded award graduate and undergraduate students are trained in solid state synthesis and physics of materials; the principal investigator also leverages results from this grant for outreach activities such as the 'Introduce a Girl to Engineering' day, the 'Lady Spartans Engineering Summer Camp' and in-class activities at local high schools. <br/><br/><br/>Part 2:   Technical Summary<br/><br/>The research for this award is based on the understanding that one of the most fundamental conflicts in the design of thermoelectric materials - the need for simultaneous high electronic mobility and a high density of states near the Fermi level - can be circumvented by exploiting anisotropic electronic transport. Zintl intermetallic phases, with their vast structural variety and excellent high-temperature thermoelectric performance, stand out as an intriguing subject area for the study of thermal and electronic transport anisotropy. Although theoretical studies predict significant thermoelectric efficiency gains along the covalently-bonded, high-conductivity directions in some Zintl phases, experimental confirmation is lacking due to the difficulty of growing single crystals suitable for transport measurements. With this grant from the Solid State Materials Chemistry program the principal investigator aims to bridge this gap between theory and experiment by adapting the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) crystal growth technique to the growth of large Zintl single crystals. The TSFZ technique is a crucible-less method that combines flux growth and directional solidification and is particularly well-suited for refractory compounds with incongruent melting transitions. It is a natural extension of flux growth - a historically successful method for the growth of Zintl crystals - but it allows for the growth of larger crystals suitable for transport measurements. Zintl antimonides, which exhibit high thermoelectric efficiency even in polycrystalline form, are the focus of this work. Characterization of the grown crystals combined with first principles investigations are used to explore the link between polyanion dimensionality and transport, with an emphasis on the anisotropy of electron and phonon velocities and scattering rates. This project applies a closed-loop approach to material design and selection by directly validating theoretical predictions, thus leading to a more complete picture of anisotropic transport behavior in complex semiconductors used in a broad range of applications. At the same time results from this research are leveraged for outreach activities such as the 'Introduce a Girl to Engineering' day, the 'Lady Spartans Engineering Summer Camp' and in-class activities at local high schools."

These devices are constructed using compounds that exhibit a liquid crystal phase. Molecules in this phase can be reoriented in the presence of an electric field, which changes their optical properties. With support from this grant by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program compounds are prepared and studied that exhibit a unique type of liquid crystal phase in which the molecules can potentially undergo faster reorientation. This could lead to faster liquid crystal displays, which would improve the optical quality of the devices, and lower the amount of energy consumed by the devices. Undergraduate students at the University of Puget Sound are directly involved in all aspects of the NSF-funded research. Participation in research offers an excellent opportunity for students to enhance their critical thinking skills. These experiences provide students with strong technical training that will serve them well as they enter the workforce in a scientific field or pursue graduate studies in Chemistry or a related area. At the University of Puget Sound, 57% of the students are women, and 25% of the students identify as students of color.  This support from NSF helps the PI to provide research opportunities to students from groups who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>There has been intense interest in the biaxial nematic phase (Nb) since it was reported in high melting bent-core compounds; liquid crystal displays fabricated using this phase have the potential to undergo faster electro-optic switching. However, there is controversy as to whether this phase is truly a biaxial nematic phase; recent evidence suggests the phase consists of layered (smectic) domains (cybotactic clusters) that show nematic order only across larger length scales. This grant from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program supports the synthesis of a variety of oxadiazole-based compounds, and analysis of their liquid crystalline behavior. These studies provide critical insight into how various structural factors affect the stability and nature of the nematic phase in bent-core compounds. The preparation of series of compounds with 1) various lateral groups, 2) highly polar substituents, and 3) amide linkages allow the PI and his students to generate structure-property relationships, with the intention to learn what structural features yield a nematic phase with a low onset temperature. Synthesis of the target compounds and initial analysis of phase behavior (using polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry) are carried out at the University of Puget Sound. Collaborators of the PI study the compounds by X-ray diffraction, which provides detailed information about the molecular organization within the nematic phase. They also carry out electro-optic experiments on the derivatives with highly polar groups as these are candidates for ferroelectric switching.  Having derivatives with low temperature nematic phases would facilitate both fundamental study by physicists and investigation of possible applications.

This project will study the particular framing of the problem of hunger by policy makers and state officials. It will explain how views and strategies of hunger impacted the effort toward modernization of agriculture in colonial and postcolonial India by Americans. Focusing on statist measures, expertise, and the experience of elites and subalterns this project will highlight efforts that tailored scientific knowledge specifically to the ends of production and neglected questions of distribution. The project will illustrate how the debate between production versus distribution strategies shaped the appropriation of American technologies. It will address scientific modernization from the domain of the political, the social, and the ecological. It will also provide an occasion to explore the convergences and disjunctures of differing stakeholders visions? of progress and the impact on technology use and practice. <br/><br/>Historians of modern India have continued to explore the hows and whys of the arrested course of agricultural development in the twentieth-century. The existing scholarship characteristically relies on two core assumptions. On the one hand is the central belief of modernization theory that removal of concrete obstacles and impediments would lead to a self-perpetuating course of modernization becoming evident in the well-being of the masses. On the other hand, postcolonial scholarship in South Asian historiography continues to draw attention to the intransigence of subaltern life and consciousness that is arguably incommensurable with the logic of capitalist development. Scholars have highlighted the role of expert regime in agriculture to question the boundless power of experts and the state. In that regard this project explores the impact of the colonial moment and the American moment in the building of an expert grid in agriculture. The book argues that the agenda of technocratic modernization was engaged by groups with diverse political aims and social agenda, and connects that process of engagement with questions of rural inequality.  It illustrates this interaction while exploring two sets of records in the United States and India. On the one hand, it focusses on the work by American Presbyterian missionaries, Point Four technical and social scientific experts, and the agriculture faculty from American public land grant universities in India. On the other hand, it explores the efforts launched by nationalists and the national state in India for reviving agriculture and rural community."

The other component will be an automated management plane that will raise the level of abstraction of specifying a management operation (MOp) on the network, thereby allowing automated software to  synthesize and manage the sequence of steps necessary to achieve a complex network MOp such as upgrading software on a large network.<br/><br/>Global Internet services are an integral part of modern life and increasing their availability will benefit society. The project plans include developing software prototypes and working closely with large Internet services to increase the likelihood of technology transfer.

Many reinforced concrete buildings in the United States and around the world were built before the implementation of modern seismic design codes. Based on seismic events of recent history outside the United States, significant economic losses can be expected in the United States if similar events occur near densely populated cities. Reducing economic losses, shortening time to recovery, and returning to normal operation levels are essential and define resiliency against seismic hazard.  Existing seismic retrofit methods achieve life safety through permanent damage. This project will investigate a new seismic retrofit method which focuses on not only public safety but also on resiliency by minimizing damage. The new retrofit system will be applicable to buildings with sub-standard reinforced concrete shear walls as the lateral load resisting system. Low damage ensures that buildings can remain operational and habitable within a reasonable amount of time following an earthquake, while keeping the socio-economic losses related to the building stock to a minimum compared to systems retrofitted with traditional methods. The retrofit method can also be architecturally advantageous for cases where the scope or budget for additional lateral load resisting systems is not available. Education, outreach, and technology transfer activities will focus on raising awareness about resiliency, multiple hazards, and new building technologies, as well as increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>In this project, a new seismic retrofit method, integrating the concepts of selective weakening, hinged walls, and self-centering, will be investigated to achieve low seismic damage. The method will be targeted toward improving the performance of reinforced concrete shear walls that have design deficiencies related to confinement, transverse reinforcement, and reinforcement detailing, which have been associated with slender wall failures in past earthquakes. The retrofit method will involve converting traditional and deficient shear walls into self-centering walls by creating a cold joint near the shear wall-foundation interface (weakening) and adding unbonded external post-tensioning. The objective of this research is to understand the change in fundamental response of deficient reinforced concrete buildings when retrofitted with this method. Research methods to achieve this objective will include element and system level structural testing and analysis. Element level studies will include nonlinear analytical modeling and testing of retrofitted shear walls under reverse cyclic loading. These studies will identify viable retrofit details and target shear wall deficiencies. System level investigations will include finite element and time-history analyses to understand the interaction of retrofitted shear walls with other structural elements to control damage to these elements. Performance enhancement that can be achieved by this retrofit method will be quantified using reliability concepts. This work will create a fundamental understanding of building systems retrofitted with this method in terms of capacity, hysteretic response, and self-centering capability through nonlinear analyses, testing, and fragility studies. The findings of this research also will have the potential to advance the state-of-the-art of self-centering structures that are newly constructed. Project outcomes will produce new basic knowledge needed to retrofit deficient concrete walls and develop more resilient buildings in seismic regions and thus contribute to seismic hazard mitigation in the United States and around the world.

McMahon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison investigates the behavior of organic compounds under harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, or radiation.  These conditions, which are similar to the conditions found in flames (combustion) or in space, cause the degradation of organic compounds and generate a complex mixture of highly reactive products.  This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems - one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation's energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  The project supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Professor Robert J. McMahon has been a major contributor in developing the Department's Plan for Broadening Participation and participated in the National Diversity Equity Workshop series.  Professor Robert J. McMahon is also a champion of STEM education on the UW-Madison campus.  <br/><br/>This proposal addresses issues in mechanistic organic chemistry that are relevant to our understanding of harsh reaction environments.  The current proposal develops these issues along three major lines:  1) quantum mechanical tunneling in organic chemistry, 2) spectroscopy and photochemistry of carbon-chain molecules, and 3) generation, detection, and characterization of key chemical targets by rotational spectroscopy. The scientific impact of the proposed research reaches beyond chemistry and cuts across diverse areas of contemporary science.  Studies of spin delocalization and spin polarization underpin the development of new organic materials with novel electrical and magnetic properties.  Studies of reactive organic species contribute to a fundamental understanding of combustion.  The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an NSF-funded astronomical interferometer of radio telescopes in northern Chile, is generating a deluge of new radio-astronomical data, much of which can be interpreted only by comparison with laboratory spectra of the type that will be obtained through the proposed studies."

The goal of the first project is to develop general results about how socially optimal matches change as the nature of the productive relationship changes. For example, if a technological shift disproportionately raises the productivity of highly skilled workers, how does that affect optimal worker-firm matches? The second project explores matching that occurs when there is incomplete information about one side, like students applying to colleges, and considers whether or not higher quality means a higher rejection rate. The third project considers a strategic pairwise matching theory of accidents, and asks when regulations designed to reduce risk will in fact reduce the number of accidents, after taking into account individual re-optimization (so called ?risk compensation?). This project develops methods broadly useful in many related contexts, in order to help shed light on the design of markets and policies that to enhance societal goals.<br/><br/>The first project makes predictions for non-assortative matching, using monotone methods to produce equilibrium general comparative statics in sorting and sharing rules.

More specifically, the project studies models of (1) cluster growth, (2) randomly composited materials, and (3) diffuse gases.  Many basic and important questions about these models remain open.  One of the more striking examples is that we still lack a fully rigorous understanding how fluid equations arise from molecular interactions.  The investigator will attempt to make progress on this problem and others by applying recently-developed techniques in the theory of stochastic homogenization.  The work will have an interdisciplinary character, mixing results from probability and analysis.  The project will make use of computer simulation to empirically test ideas during development of the theory.<br/><br/>Techniques in quantitative stochastic homogenization, particularly those used to obtain optimal rates in the elliptic setting, are now mature enough to attack problems that previously did not seem to be amenable to this approach.  The basic homogenization idea remains the same, namely, to view the microscopic models as perturbations of their smooth macroscopic limits.  The key new insight is that the regularity theory of the macroscopic limit often has a microscopic analogue.  Examples of possible applications include the derivation of the Landau equation as a scaling limit of interacting particles and Anderson localization for a Bernoulli potential on the lattice.  This approach has already proved successful, and the investigator expects it to continue to yield new results."

Humans are remarkably adept at predicting the actions of other people and making inferences about their intention and goals. The present investigation examines how humans make such inferences from the physical movements of others. The work is guided by a computational theory of biological motion understanding that quantifies what aspects of actions allow observers to make inferences about the meaning of actions and what might come next. The larger goal is to explain how perception and reasoning operate synergistically to infer hidden goals and intentions. These findings will guide development of the next generation of intelligent machine-vision systems, useful in forensic sciences as well as many other real-world applications. Such systems will need to perform challenging tasks that currently are difficult and time-consuming for humans (for example, automated interpretation of human actions recorded in low-resolution surveillance video). The project will also help to identify individual differences in action understanding, potentially revealing the nature of the impairments in action understanding observed in people with autism disorder. In addition, the project will provide a unique training opportunity for students who are interested in interdisciplinary research at the interface between cognitive science and artificial intelligence and will provide an in-depth international research experience for a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow.<br/><br/>The research will integrate advanced psychophysical methods with sophisticated computational approaches. A key aim is to develop a unified theory based on a hierarchical non-parametric Bayesian framework, specifying the fundamental computational mechanisms involved in perception of human actions and reasoning about them. More generally, the project will use human body movements as an underutilized approach to understanding general problems in learning: how to construct, use and transform hierarchical representations to support human perception and cognition. Three aims are particularly noteworthy. First, the project will integrate computational modeling approaches with behavioral experiments to investigate the critical connection between perceptual and cognitive systems. Second, the project uses action stimuli derived from motion capture data in the real world as the visual input (CCTV images collected in the UK and secured at the University of Glasgow). By avoiding the limitations of studies that use restricted examples and constrained environments, the investigators maximize the likelihood that the findings will generalize to real-world situations. Third, the project will develop significant extensions of Bayesian approaches in order to study complex visual processes by combining generative models with probabilistic constraints.

The project team will investigate students' mathematical activity and learning while the students are engaged with the digital platform and will use this insight to inform further refinement of design. Building on prior research efforts in the learning and teaching of linear algebra and expertise in Game Based Learning (GBL), the team will design IOLA-G to mimic the problem-centered approach of the existing IOLA curriculum and will iteratively refine this platform through teaching experiments with students throughout the project. The project also will explore the extent to which GBL can provide a dynamic approach to addressing the constraints that larger class sizes place on instructors' implementation of inquiry-oriented curricula. In addition to, and as part of the process of, creating the resource technology, the investigators will incorporate a mixed methods approach with a blending of game-based learning design, curriculum design theory, and research from inquiry-based learning to explore the following research questions: What are the mathematical practices that students engage in and the conceptual understandings students develop using IOLA-G compared to when using only the face-to-face IOLA curriculum? What are the affordances and constraints of different game environments in terms of enacting an inquiry-oriented curriculum? The impact of the project will include the positive effects on STEM discipline student learning, knowledge, abilities, and overall success, which will lead to strengthening United States workforce needs in STEM areas."

These classes of complexes exhibit technologically important properties in magnetism and imaging.  They have potential applications in near-infrared luminescent sensors, inorganic light emitting diodes and bar code labels, and quantum computing.  The imaging agents are patentable and discussions are underway for licensing for cell fixation and necrosis assays.  The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and biological chemistry.  It is well suited to the education of scientists at all levels and across international boundaries.  It also serves as the basis for a Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme program that brings junior scientists across Europe to the US for training and students from Professor Vincent Pecoraro's group to Europe. Outreach activities involving K-12 students and for students underrepresented in science are also part of the funded project.  <br/><br/>Metallacrowns display a rich array of photophysical properties, including the highest reported quantum yields and brightness for molecular Lanthanide complexes emitting in the near infrared spectral region. In addition, binuclear lanthanides encapsulated within diamagnetic metallacrowns show energy gaps that are appropriate for exploitation as qubits for the development of quantum computers. The proposed work exploits these properties to generate luminescent dendrimers and Janus dendrimers for imaging applications. The simple metallacrown motif will also be used as nodes to develop luminescent metal organic frameworks that may be used for sensing applications. These studies broaden the range of synthetic possibilities for both dendrimers and metal organic frameworks by leading to new structure types with either magnetic or luminescent properties."

In simple materials, chemical reactions or processes can be experimentally parsed into fundamental steps, each with a well-defined rate.  When a material is composed of complex molecules or molecular assemblies, these fundamental steps often appear to have a spread of rates.  The multidimensional methods being developed at the Professor Berg's lab help to determine the nature and lifetime of states which cause the spread of rates.  The methods being developed here extend to a wide range of processes and materials in biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering. Professor Berg works with graduate and undergraduate students closely on the development of these complex methods of characterizing matter. He is also involved in a number of creative approaches to engage students from underrepresented minority groups in the research project. <br/><br/>Three subprojects each address a different material, kinetic problem and technical challenge.  The rotation rates of probe molecules inserted into microstructured materials are currently used to measure local viscosity at specific points within the structure.  These experiments often yield a range of rotational rates.  Six-pulse, polarized optical experiments are being developed to determine whether this range is caused by variability in the microstructure or by local anisotropy in the structure.  The green-fluorescent protein (GFP) is a prototype for understanding reaction dynamics within a protein.  A multicolor, multidimensional, optical experiment is being developed to determine if the multiple rates observed in GFP kinetics are due to multiple protein substates or due to unresolved intermediate steps in the photocycle.  Multidimensional methods of analyzing computer simulations are being developed to understand the formation of long-lived structures within liquids as the liquid is cooled.  Although experiments can see these effects at low temperatures, simulations are currently the best approach to probing their initial formation at higher temperatures. Professor Berg intends not only to advance fundamental understanding about molecular reaction kinetics but also to provide students an interdisciplinary training experience, in particular those students from underrepresented minority groups."

Understanding the reasons for losing this knowledge is fundamental to explaining how cultures maintain practices and beliefs over generations.  The research supported by this award focuses on understanding the transmission of traditional cultural knowledge about the role of land and its use.  This research will investigate the barriers to the communication of this knowledge as well as seeking to understand how changes in language and decreasing access to and availability of resources represent substantial social and environmental challenges facing the Cherokee people.  How will the Cherokee people address these challenges and develop strategies for cultural revitalization and modify traditional practices of communicating cultural knowledge.  To answer these questions, anthropologist Dr. Clint R. Carroll of the University of Colorado-Boulder will investigate how Native American people mentally and physically navigate barriers to their land-based cultural knowledge and practices, how such approaches to social and environmental challenges may inform the broader society, and whether tribal environmental education in traditional and standard science can contribute to local cultural and ecological resiliency. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out in five Oklahoma counties where Cherokees are the largest minority. The project has three phases. First, the PI will collaborate with the tribal biologist and a Cherokee group dedicated to the preservation of traditional ecological knowledge to devise modules for a special 3-year program focused on teaching the following: Western and Cherokee knowledge of regional plants, animals, and ecological processes; social science research methods, including ethnographic interviewing, participatory mapping, and GIS; Cherokee language; and traditional Cherokee medicine. The PI and his collaborators will then competitively select students to complete the program and gather data. The researcher and the students will survey rural households, conduct in-depth ethnographic interviews, and carry out participatory mapping to locate resource areas, record knowledge about those areas, and determine barriers to assessing them. The project will conclude with an assessment of the educational program, finalizing the resource maps, and analyzing the data to pinpoint the linkages between resource access, knowledge preservation, language revitalization, and land conservation. Findings from the research will document and contribute to social science theory of cultural resilience and adaptation to the environmental shifts and changing resource access accompanying climate change. Broader Impacts include training a future generation of Cherokee scientists, supporting tribal efforts to maintain language and traditional ecological knowledge, and documenting resources and language. All materials produced will be housed with the Cherokee Nation, in Oklahoma archives, and at the University of Colorado."

Unfortunately, providing robust kinesthetic haptic feedback often comes at the expense of control stability, which cannot be improved using simplified models of the operator's arm impedance that fail to take into account that individuals typically dynamically modulate this value throughout a given task.  A primary objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that modulation of a kinesthetic haptic device's controlled and/or inherent impedance in accordance with the operator's impedance will improve the interface to and utility of HiLTS.   Improving haptic feedback methodologies is an important area of research in HiLTS, haptic display, and human-machine interaction more generally.  This work will provide a framework for relating haptic device impedance to user impedance and produce a set of generalizable principles for investigating all aspects of haptic device impedance on user impedance.  Ultimately, project outcomes will lead to tele-robots that come closer to being embodied by their operators, thereby allowing for more robust and dexterous manipulation.  The work will have broad impact on a variety of applications including surgical robotics, upper-limb prosthetics, and rehabilitation robotics.  Educational and outreach activities will include conference workshops, a special topics course on HiLTS, lab tours, and summer activities for K-12 and underrepresented students.<br/><br/>Real-time measurements of the operator's arm impedance are possible using only knowledge of muscle activation and joint configuration, and further, these measures can be used as a basis for robotic control and stability.  However, these methods have yet to gain widespread attention in the field of haptic display, where significant potential exists given the coupled nature of the human and device dynamics through a kinesthetic haptic device.  Therefore, improving upon current methods of haptic display, especially for HiLTS, should involve active modulation of the operator's impedance through the haptic device, in a manner consistent with the modulations which occur through physical interaction with the natural limb.  This research will contribute to both a theoretical and empirical understanding of the effect of haptic device impedance on the endpoint arm stiffness of a human user for the purpose of improved utility in HiLTS.  The approach will involve: (1) identifying relationships between endpoint arm stiffness and environment impedance; (2) identifying relationships between endpoint arm stiffness and haptic device impedance; and (3) quantifying the effect of haptic device impedance modulation on endpoint arm stiffness in HiLTS."

The funds will be used to provide partial support for the registration and travel costs of conference attendees with special emphasis on conference speakers, junior scientists, post-doctoral researchers and graduate students from a wide variety of backgrounds. The 2018 Mesophotic Coral Reef Ecosystems GRC will provide a significant scientific and educational forum for this rapidly emerging field of coral reef science. This conference will be able to foster a diverse interdisciplinary meeting that brings many of the world's current scientists working in this field while also providing a dynamic forum to recruit new investigators and broaden diversity in the field. Climate change will continue to affect shallow coral reefs for decades to come but we know very little about the role(s) of MCEs in the resilience of their shallow water counterparts. The physical and biological connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs is essential to understand at a time when we do not even have a grasp of the extent and biodiversity of MCEs around the world. The support will help this growing field of researchers to coalesce behind some central questions and diversify in terms of discipline, gender and race. The GRC organizers anticipate this will result in an improved global network of mesophotic coral reef scientists that will be able to engage in interdisciplinary studies to answer critical questions on MCEs in a collaborative way.<br/><br/>Mesophotic Coral Reef Ecosystems (MCEs) are unique and understudied ecosystems characterized as low-light adapted deep reef communities that occur from ~30-150m. These reefs are typically further offshore from anthropogenic stressors and are below the depth limits of most natural disturbances. The habitat available for the development of MCEs has been variably estimated at three to ten times the known areal extent of shallow coral reefs (<30 m). As a result, MCEs are increasingly recognized as potentially important refugia for a variety of shallow reef species currently impacted by climate change related stressors. Therefore, there is a critical need to address many questions regarding the structure and function of MCE communities in their own right, but also in the broadest sense that includes their role in the resilience of shallow coral reef communities to environmental insults. The group of scientists studying MCEs is growing rapidly and includes coral reef ecologists, molecular biologists, oceanographers, physiologists, biogeochemists, paleo-climatologists, fisheries biologists, microbiologists, chemical ecologists, population geneticists and managers interested in resource conservation. This GRC will assemble experts from around the world, as well as students and post-doctoral researchers, to present new data and evaluate the evidence supporting the multiple factors controlling the structure and function of MCE communities worldwide. Given the increasing number of investigators devoting research time to this new field of coral reef ecology and biology, and the increasing number of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers involved, the GRC expect to attract a minimum of 150 participants from around the world. Moreover, MCEs represent a unique biophysical gradient that is attracting researchers from other fields to address issues of adaptation at the genetic, biochemical, and physiological levels in these natural laboratories."

This  is a significant and sustained reversal of previous trends. Historically, increases in mortality have rarely occurred outside of war or epidemics. The rise was not seen for any other American ethnic group or in any other high income country. It is most severe among men and women who are 45 to 54 years of age, have a high school education or less, and are  living in smaller metro and rural areas in the South and West census regions. It appears to be the result of increases in suicides and drug and alcohol abuse.  However, the statistics can only reveal patterns. To get at underlying causes, it is necessary to also have smaller studies of social context and the  distress driving the crisis. The research funded by this award addresses this need. Medical anthropologist Dr. Michelle A. Parsons, of Northern Arizona University, will undertake an ethnographic case study of life threatening social distress among middle-aged non-Hispanic whites in Arizona.<br/><br/>Dr. Parsons' preliminary hypothesis is that distress is associated with social integration, in particular a feeling of not being needed or not being useful, which is produced through specific political, economic, cultural, and institutional structures. She will explore this hypothesis with a mixed methods ethnographic case study. The research will be carried out among a midlife generation with lower levels of education in Yavapai County, which has one of the highest age-standardized midlife suicide rates in Arizona and is among the top ten highest rates among all U.S. counties. She will draw her sample from employees of the social institutions that are the largest employers in the county: healthcare institutions, government institutions, and social service providers. Methods include secondary analysis of publicly available datasets, participant observation, archival research, key informant interviews (n=40), structured interviews (n=200), and semi-structured in-depth interviews (n=80). A community advisory board will work with the research team and help with dissemination of research results and recommendations to county and state health and government organizations. The broader impacts of the research are threefold. First, findings from the study will improve understanding of midlife distress in an area of the U.S. with a very high rate of midlife suicide. This will enable  recommendations for multilevel interventions to reduce distress and mortality. The research also will elucidate the social context of rising mortality, identifying factors potentially related to mortality increases in other areas of the United States.  Finally, the project will advance knowledge in medical anthropology, sociology, and other disciplines, including public health, epidemiology, and clinical psychology."

Hydroxyl radicals are a key oxidant in the atmosphere and often called the atmosphere's detergent. Professor Lester and her group are exploring atmospheric chemical reactions that produce hydroxyl radicals. Their work is leading to a better understanding of the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, where we live and breathe, and thus has potential benefits to society.<br/> <br/>The reactive intermediates that give rise to hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere are produced by reactions of ozone with isoprene, a small molecule that is produced in large quantities by plants, and other alkenes (often called ""volatile organic compounds""). When formed, these intermediates have enough internal energy that they spontaneously fall apart into an organic fragment and a hydroxyl radical, in a process known as ""unimolecular decay,"" or react with other molecules.  The problem is a difficult one because the intermediates are large and complex, and understanding their chemistry requires the use of state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods. Professor Lester and her group produce these reactive intermediates in the laboratory, and study their unimolecular decay and light-induced dissociation processes using action spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The students working with Professor Lester gain experience in sophisticated experimental and theoretical methods that probe the physical properties of molecules and chemical reactions, and thus a significant broader impact of the project is its contribution to the training of future scientists."

Highly compressed CO2 behaves as a fluid, and is more environmentally friendly and more versatile than many petroleum-derived solvents used in industrial processes.   However, the reasons for CO2's versatility are not well understood. In the Peebles' laboratory, a single molecule of solute is isolated with one or a few CO2 solvent molecules. By probing these small clusters with microwave radiation, the arrangement of solvent molecules can be determined. Systematically varying the number of CO2 molecules builds understanding of its unique properties as a solvent. In a second related area of research, electrically charged molecules (carbocations) are generated and their structures are studied via interactions with microwave radiation. As with the CO2 clusters, this provides information about the arrangement of atoms, in this case helping answer questions about the specific steps by which atoms rearrange during a chemical reaction. Both aspects of this research also utilize computational studies to provide more information about the arrangement of electrons within the chemical structures.  The results of this research may advance the use of CO2 as a solvent in important chemical processes.<br/><br/>The project uses Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy for investigating structures of unstable chemical species. A theme is the effect of halogen atom substitution within the chemical structures studied. In CO2 microsolvation studies, clusters are generated using a supersonic expansion into a vacuum chamber. Examination of clusters with varying amounts of fluorine substitution builds towards an understanding of why fluorinated species have unusually high solubility in supercritical CO2. Varying the number of CO2 molecules in a cluster allows observation of how weak intermolecular interactions vary as solvation occurs. The knowledge gained from these studies may also help in understanding and building CO2 sequestration frameworks using custom designed molecules. In the second part of the research, carbocations are generated using a pulsed discharge nozzle or electron gun together with the supersonic expansion. Probing with microwave radiation then provides structural information, helping scientists to understand whether carbocations exist in cyclic or noncyclic forms, and how structures change as halogen substitution is varied. In addition to implications for industrial use of CO2, broader impacts are hands-on education of undergraduate students in Chemistry and other STEM fields. Students gain significant practical, problem solving and computer skills and improve their critical thinking abilities."

At such low temperatures, the internal motions of molecules are greatly slowed, making them easier to study.  In order to study chemical reactions at such low temperatures, the atoms or molecules must be placed in an environment that keeps them cold, but also allows them to interact with each other. Since most common liquids freeze at such low temperatures, the atoms and molecules dissolved in them are prevented from colliding and interacting with each other. The PI overcomes these challenges by using helium droplets, which are still liquid at absolute zero, as test tubes in his studies. In his previous studies, Professor Vilesov made an additional interesting observation, namely that tiny vortices (similar to whirlpools) present in the helium droplets help form wire-shaped particles just a few atoms across. The properties and stability of such particles made of different materials are systematically studied with state of the art laser and cryogenic techniques. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the mechanisms of aggregation of atoms and molecules at an ultra low temperature of 0.4 K. Free superfluid helium droplets up to 1 micrometer in diameter are doped with atoms or molecules, which then form clusters inside the droplet. The structure, stability and energy levels of the clusters are interrogated by laser spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray scattering techniques. Quantum vortices present in the superfluid droplets attract the imbedded particles serving as a template for low temperature aggregation. The properties of the resulting nanometer-thin, track-shaped clusters are in the focus of this project. In addition, this proposal includes the development of an experimental technique for the exploration of low temperature ion-molecule reactions using infrared spectroscopy and monitoring of the solvation effects in small carbocations and protonated water clusters. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from exploring unconventional paths for making useful nanomaterials. This project provides opportunities for training of undergraduate and graduate students in STEM field by developing of the cutting edge physical experiments and preparation of the ensuing publications."

The cost and sustainability of these products are directly impacted by the development of new catalysts that are less expensive, that generate less waste, and that operate under milder conditions. A particularly important goal for the field is to replace catalysts that are based on rare and expensive precious metals (e.g. palladium) and towards those derived from inexpensive and more readily available metals (e.g., nickel). Often, however, the more desirable inexpensive metals have very different (and often problematic) properties, that make them difficult to use for these important applications. In this project Dr. Sanford and her research group are conducting detailed studies of nickel catalysts. The overall goal of this work is to determine how to control the properties of nickel catalysts to enable them to perform as well or better than their palladium analogues. Dr. Sanford is also actively involved in outreach activities that seek to increase the participation of women in science and engineering. For example, she is working with programs that engage middle-school aged girls in scientific activities and that train diverse graduate students for careers in science/technology.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Sanford of the University of Michigan is studying the fundamental organometallic chemistry of high valent nickel intermediates [i.e., nickel(III) and nickel(IV) complexes].

Less well-understood is the fact that plants have very complex light perception systems that relate to, but are separable from photosynthesis. These systems allow plants to perceive their constantly changing light environment and make appropriate developmental ""decisions"", influencing everything from when to germinate to the patterns of growth and the timing of reproduction. Thus, discovering how these light perception systems mechanistically function is absolutely essential for understanding plants in both highly manipulated agricultural settings and more natural ecosystems. Many scientists have investigated these processes and much is known about how specific photoreceptors perceive individual wavelengths of light and relay this information within the plant. It is well-understood that perception of different wavelengths of light causes massive and rapid alterations in gene expression, resulting in visually obvious changes to the plant, such as increased stem elongation in far red light conditions. The Holt Lab recently discovered several new genes that regulate the point at which light signals are turned into changes in gene expression. This NSF award will allow them to further explore the mechanistic basis for these functions - i.e., they will extend their discovery process from the ""who"" to the ""how"". The proposed research will include training and mentoring of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students in cutting edge genetic and biochemical research. Additionally, the PI will participate in an annual freshman mentoring program for incoming science majors, host two summer REU undergraduate students in each funded year, and incorporate aspects of the research into an undergraduate course in plant physiology.<br/><br/>While our mechanistic understanding of light signaling pathways has matured greatly in recent years, there is evidence that not all of the photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription factors have been identified. For example, far red light is primarily perceived by the phyA photoreceptor and this pathway terminates in the activation of a number of well-characterized transcription factors, in particular HFR1, HY5, and LAF1. However, even triple mutant plants for these genes do not fully recapitulate the phenotypes of phyA mutants or plants grown in the dark. NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factors were recently identified as additional components of several light signaling pathways, especially far red light. Additionally, these genes appear to signal at least partially, if not completely, independent of HY5. Thus, the principal research objective supported by this funding is to test the hypothesis that NF-Y transcription factors regulate a previously non-described far red light signaling pathway, operating in parallel, but independent to the well-described HFR1, HY5, and LAF1 transcription factors. The specific aims of the project are directed towards directly testing this hypothesis, mechanistically exploring NF-Y function related to the proteasome, and use of a suppressor screen to provide a broader context for NF-Y signaling during photomorphogenesis."

For instance, the widespread power outages in the New York City metropolitan area due to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused huge economic loss estimated to be $50B along with severe societal consequences. Moreover, a recent study suggests that even a small-scale attack on the U.S. power grid could cause a nationwide blackout. Network robustness is the key to identifying and minimizing the vulnerability of such critical infrastructure networks. For example, in intelligent transportation systems, network robustness can help alleviate traffic congestion. The vast majority of the existing work on network robustness is essentially observational. Although remarkable progress has been made in terms of observing network robustness, an equally important problem, which has not been sufficiently studied, is how to design effective strategies to intervene to improve the network's robustness desired ways. <br/><br/>Building upon the existing observational work, this project aims to further investigate an intervention approach to network robustness. The overall goal of this project is to develop basic theories and algorithms that result in a robust network, referred to as the network robustification problem. This will be pursued through three research thrusts. The first thrust aims to develop basic theories for the network robustification problem, including its unification, its hardness, and its approximability. The second thrust aims to develop a suite of effective, scalable and adaptive algorithms to optimize the network robustness in a desired way. The third thrust validates and verifies the proposed techniques in the context of real-world applications, including an intelligent transportation system and an online social collaboration. Upon completion, this project will advance the state-of-the-art of network robustness in two directions. First, it will lay down a few critical steps to pave the theoretic foundations of the network robustification problem, including its unification, its hardness and its approximability. Second, it will lead to new algorithms and tools with better effectiveness, scalability, applicability and adaptability. The research plan is closely integrated with its education plan to promote data mining at Arizona State University, to train graduate students in the related fields, and to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students as well as K-12 students.

Teachers' implementation of flipped instruction has increased dramatically in recent years, with more than two-thirds of teachers now reporting flipping a lesson, if not an entire course. Although popular media and philanthropic organizations have given a great deal of attention and financial support to flipped instruction, little is known about how teachers implement it and what benefits and drawbacks flipped instruction has in contrast with non-flipped instruction. This study can provide a basis for design research focused on developing effective materials and programs for flipped instruction in secondary mathematics. This design and development is already occurring at an increasing rate, but it is not yet informed by empirical evidence. This project will result in a framework for flipped instruction robust enough to be useful at a variety of grade levels and contexts. The framework will provide a better understanding of the relationships among various implementations of flipped instruction and student learning. These findings can inform teacher educators in better aligning their instruction to instructional formats that correlate with increased student learning outcomes. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of STEM innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>Using mixed-methods techniques, the study will look at the nature of the activities and interactions occurring in mathematics classrooms and assess their quality so that the researchers may distinguish high-quality from low-quality univocal discourse, high-quality from low-quality dialogic discourse, and high cognitive demand from low cognitive demand tasks. Working in 40 algebra classrooms -- 20 implementing some form of flipped instruction and 20 serving as a non-flipped basis for comparison -- the project will address the following research questions using a correlational design and multilevel modeling techniques: RQ1. What are salient factors entailed in flipped instruction in secondary algebra? RQ2. What associations, if any, exist among factors entailed in teachers' implementation of flipped algebra instruction and students' learning of algebra as measured on a state-mandated end-of-course assessment and on a concept-of-variable inventory?"

Because of the importance of pollinators, insuring their health is essential for preserving biodiversity and promoting global agricultural security. As pollinators, some native bees can show strong loyalty by limiting their visits to only flowers from a certain species, while other bees may not be so loyal, visiting many different types of flowers. In theory, plants with loyal pollinators should produce more fruit and seeds because the pollinators provide only the appropriate pollen type when they visit.  The aim of this research is to understand the degree to which native bees show loyalty to certain plants. This study also explores how the sharing of pollinators between closely related plants might influence how many seeds those plants produce. If some of the plants do worse than others when sharing pollinators, differences in pollinator loyalty may influence how common or rare those plants become. The results of this research are important for understanding the role pollinators play in maintaining healthy and diverse agricultural and natural plant communities. This research contributes to the training of a graduate student, develops a lab and field program for a high school biology class and provides opportunities to engage and encourage women and under-represented students in STEM science.<br/><br/>Coexistence theory addresses how species richness is maintained in biological communities by framing species interactions as a balance of competition within versus between species. This study uses that theory to investigate whether pollinator sharing affects coexistence dynamics in four co-occurring plants in the genus Clarkia. Determining whether pollinator sharing is detrimental or favorable for flowering plant coexistence hinges on understanding the flower preference and constancy of native bees that specialize on flowers and the quantity of pollen they provide. The diversity and quantity of pollen found on Clarkia's pollinators will be measured with a genetic identification technique (qPCR). These measurements will be used in conjunction with estimates of each plant species' competitive ability to determine whether shared pollinators can change plant fitness and whether the pattern shows a negative frequency dependence. This study will shed light on the role that pollinator sharing can play in promoting the coexistence of flowering plants."

The proposed program includes linking chemistry concepts and green chemical methods to hands-on research experiences that will stimulate students' awareness and the pursuit of scientific careers. Students will be exposed to overarching themes of green chemistry, recycling, and sustainability, as well as their impact on the world.  Since Chemistry is a service department for majors in four colleges at Tuskegee University, the proposed activities' emphasis on proper waste disposal, environmental impacts, and green chemistry principles will not only have a broad institutional impact, but will have a major impact on preparing students for a global STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the program is to improve Tuskegee University's chemistry laboratory curriculum and the environment through three initiatives: 1) professional development activities for teaching with a guided inquiry-based model; 2) inclusion of Green Chemistry principles throughout the chemistry laboratory curriculum; and 3) increased student hands-on access to instrumentation. The goals will be accomplished through the development of several Guided Inquiry experiments that begin from the waste stream of the general chemistry laboratory. Silver salt waste from general chemistry laboratory will be collected and purified by analytical chemistry laboratory students.  The purified silver salts will be reused in general chemistry and used as catalysts in organic chemistry laboratory synthesis.  Students in nanotechnology will use the recycled silver to synthesize silver nanoparticles and investigate their biological activities.  These silver nanoparticles will be utilized in the biochemistry laboratories to demonstrate their antimicrobial properties.  Thus, the project will be a closed loop process that involves various levels of the institution's chemistry laboratories.  Two significant benefits of the proposed activity include diversification of the experiment portfolio and the reduction of laboratory waste."

Many reinforced concrete buildings in the United States and around the world were built before the implementation of modern seismic design codes. Based on seismic events of recent history outside the United States, significant economic losses can be expected in the United States if similar events occur near densely populated cities. Reducing economic losses, shortening time to recovery, and returning to normal operation levels are essential and define resiliency against seismic hazard.  Existing seismic retrofit methods achieve life safety through permanent damage. This project will investigate a new seismic retrofit method which focuses on not only public safety but also on resiliency by minimizing damage. The new retrofit system will be applicable to buildings with sub-standard reinforced concrete shear walls as the lateral load resisting system. Low damage ensures that buildings can remain operational and habitable within a reasonable amount of time following an earthquake, while keeping the socio-economic losses related to the building stock to a minimum compared to systems retrofitted with traditional methods. The retrofit method can also be architecturally advantageous for cases where the scope or budget for additional lateral load resisting systems is not available. Education, outreach, and technology transfer activities will focus on raising awareness about resiliency, multiple hazards, and new building technologies, as well as increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>In this project, a new seismic retrofit method, integrating the concepts of selective weakening, hinged walls, and self-centering, will be investigated to achieve low seismic damage. The method will be targeted toward improving the performance of reinforced concrete shear walls that have design deficiencies related to confinement, transverse reinforcement, and reinforcement detailing, which have been associated with slender wall failures in past earthquakes. The retrofit method will involve converting traditional and deficient shear walls into self-centering walls by creating a cold joint near the shear wall-foundation interface (weakening) and adding unbonded external post-tensioning. The objective of this research is to understand the change in fundamental response of deficient reinforced concrete buildings when retrofitted with this method. Research methods to achieve this objective will include element and system level structural testing and analysis. Element level studies will include nonlinear analytical modeling and testing of retrofitted shear walls under reverse cyclic loading. These studies will identify viable retrofit details and target shear wall deficiencies. System level investigations will include finite element and time-history analyses to understand the interaction of retrofitted shear walls with other structural elements to control damage to these elements. Performance enhancement that can be achieved by this retrofit method will be quantified using reliability concepts. This work will create a fundamental understanding of building systems retrofitted with this method in terms of capacity, hysteretic response, and self-centering capability through nonlinear analyses, testing, and fragility studies. The findings of this research also will have the potential to advance the state-of-the-art of self-centering structures that are newly constructed. Project outcomes will produce new basic knowledge needed to retrofit deficient concrete walls and develop more resilient buildings in seismic regions and thus contribute to seismic hazard mitigation in the United States and around the world.

Professor Zhao is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).  He is developing a new method for the selective synthesis of multiple stereoisomers of organic molecules.  Stereoisomers, which differ only subtly in their structures, may have totally different biological and/or pharmacological properties. The goal of this research project is to exploit the unique properties of modularly designed organocatalysts (MDOs) to achieve the easy synthesis of multiple diastereomers of complex organic molecules from the same starting materials, which is presently a very challenging task in chemistry. The research greatly facilitates the exploration of new chemical space and drug discovery. This project offers research opportunities for students, including students from underrepresented minorities, who are preparing for careers in the chemical sciences. UTSA is one of the most diverse institutions of higher education in the United States. Professor Zhao's group provides a high level of education and training for students through a variety of outreach programs that are already in place at UTSA.<br/><br/>Catalytic asymmetric syntheses of multiple diastereomers of various important polysubstituted carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds are under investigation.  The researchers use the same starting materials and different modularly designed organocatalysts to selectively generate different stereoisomers of the targets. Specifically, Professor Zhao is pursuing the development of novel MDO catalysts that are self-assembled from readily available precatalysts and the utilization of the MDOs in the catalytic tandem reactions for the diastereodivergent synthesis of polysubstituted carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds. The method is being investigated for the diastereodivergent syntheses of bioactive natural products of medicinal relevance. The research provides new catalysts that not only achieve the divergent synthesis of different stereoisomers of important molecules, but also improves the stereoselectivity in the synthesis.   Stereoselective synthesis is a current challenge in asymmetric catalysis. The research results are being incorporated into an organic laboratory aimed at undergraduates to help stimulate their interest and attract these students to the chemical sciences."

These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. <br/><br/><br/>In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

In his earlier research, the principal investigator (PI) created new tools for optimal transport theory, a theory which  has experienced a mathematical renaissance over the last twenty-five years by weaving together threads from analysis, geometry, partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamical systems. Motivated by his work on systems with large numbers of particles, the PI, with collaborators,  has discovered some connections between optimal transportation, games with a large number of players, and Mean Field Games. These unexpected connections open doors to several new  avenues of research, some of which being  described in this proposal.  The goal of this project is to advance knowledge in various other related topics. This includes the geometry of the space of closed differential forms with  the  non--linear factorization of  differential forms.  This proposal involves  training students, mentoring postdocs and organizing  learning seminars for graduate students. The PI will remain involved in national as well as international activities. These, constitute the broader impacts of the proposed activities. <br/><br/>The PI studies the mathematical aspects of Density Functional Theory (DFT), as well as  certain  geometric clustering problems originating in combinatorial optimization. What many of these problems have in common, and what is sometimes novel in the approach for studying them, is their formulation on infinite dimensional ``manifolds''  equipped with metric, differential, and symplectic pseudo-structures.  This infinite dimensional setting often lead to a new outlook and --at least on the formal level-- to novel and simpler approaches to otherwise complex problems. A typical example is how Otto's calculus turns many nonlinear PDEs into gradient flows of geodesically convex functionals. In a similar fashion, our searching for geodesic of minimal lengths on the set of  differential forms, leads to a new concept of ``quasiconvexity,"" that looks like an extension of the concept originally  introduced by C. Morrey and used extensively in non--linear elasticity theory. Part of the challenge, however, includes turning formal arguments into rigorous ones to yield new results.  The intellectual merit of the research is that the problems to be studied have the potential of revealing principles which can be extended to a more general context."

Yet we still know little about the role of questioning in STEM learning. This project investigates how and why certain types of questions may be better at fostering learning. In particular, in contrast to questions asked by a person seeking to learn something new (information-seeking questions), children may learn better from questions asked by someone who clearly knows the answer and intends to teach (pedagogical questions). This project bridges what we know about the development of children's thinking with research on how specific types of questions work to support young children's learning of science. To learn more about this, it examines the role of two types of questions across a range of scientific methods including experiments in laboratory settings, observation of children's conversations with parents and teachers in museums and classrooms, and interventions to test how types of questions work in the everyday activity of storybook reading. In addition to their importance for families, project findings will be valuable to preschool and elementary teachers and to educators who work in informal science settings such as science museums, zoos, and play centers. The project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which funds basic research that seeks to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.<br/> <br/>The project builds upon a long tradition of educational and developmental research on children's learning from questions in formal and informal STEM learning environments. Taking a new perspective, the project takes into account the relations among questions, the questioner, and learning goals. Specifically, it proposes that questions from knowledgeable others who intend to teach (i.e., pedagogical questions) may facilitate learning by eliciting children's inferences about the importance of the scientific subject being questioned, and by encouraging their further exploration and discovery learning. These assumptions will be tested across five empirical studies, each with its own specific aim. Aim 1 is to identify pedagogical questions and their effects on children's learning and exploration of scientific information in a controlled laboratory environment. Aim 2 seeks to characterize the use of pedagogical questions in math, physics, and biology classrooms using archival videos and transcripts from the ClassBank database, and explores the relation of pedagogical questions to student engagement. Aim 3 is to characterize the use of pedagogical questions in naturalistic parent-child conversations documented in the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) database, and explore the influence of socio-cultural factors on parents' tendencies to ask different types of questions. These factors include family socioeconomic status, presence of mothers and fathers, children's age, historical trend, and others. Aim 4 tests how natural variation in parents' use of pedagogical questions relates to children's learning and exploration in a science museum. Aim 5 tests an intervention that prompts parents to ask pedagogical questions during storybook sharing and examines how this intervention relates to children's learning of scientific knowledge. Across these five studies pedagogical questions are expected to have a facilitative role for children's learning and exploration, while socio-cultural factors are expected to influence how pedagogical questions are asked by parents and interpreted by children. Taken as a whole, this project has potential to deliver empirical evidence and a more comprehensive theory about when and why questions lead to learning. This research is important to society because it can lead to evidence-based recommendations about how to effectively use questions to enhance STEM teaching and children's learning."

A general form of the question asks: Given an approximate solution, is there necessarily also an exact solution that is close to the approximate solution? This question has been studied intensively in many directions, with answers depending on the specific system and the exact meaning of ""approximate solution"" and ""close."" The current research project develops such a theory for equations in sets of permutations. This case is of special interest for two reasons: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a ""local testability"" question, a subject of great interest in computer science. Namely, it is part of a series of problems of the following flavor: a very large string of letters is given, and one wants to check its properties by knowing only a few of the letters. A second reason is that it turns out that the question under study in this project is intimately related to some deep concepts in abstract algebra. It is thus a project of a very interdisciplinary nature, involving a blend of several areas of mathematics and computer science.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project deals with property testing within group theory. Property testing is a direction of research in computer science that looks for methods to check a property of a given object, say a long vector of 0's and 1's, by looking only at a small number of random bits of it.  The following question is of this type. Given a word w(X,Y) built from elements X and Y of the symmetric group of permutations on a set T, assume that for two permutations A and B, w(A,B) leaves unchanged some randomly selected elements of T. Can it be inferred that w(A,B) is the identity, or at least, that A and B are close to a pair of permutations A' and B' for which w(A',B') is the identity? It turns out that the answer to this question depends only on the structure of the (usually infinite) group whose presentation by generators and relations is given by these words. This suggests a concept of testability (or stability) in group theory. The main objective of this project is to develop a set of tools to determine which groups are testable and which are not. The project will also explore connections with amenability, Kazhdan's Property (T), and sofic groups."

The problems considered share the features of computational complexity, multiple length/time scales, and genuine physical interest in applications.  Many concern questions that current numerics and experiment are not adequate to resolve.  Several of the planned subprojects involve numerically assisted proof using scientific computation with guaranteed error bounds, up to and including rigorous numerical proof.  An integral part of the project is the simultaneous development of a user-friendly numerical platform, STABLAB, for numerical stability investigation, and the systematic exploration with this platform of physical behavior in gas and fluid dynamics in the delicate situations of reacting or ionized flow.  <br/><br/>The problems addressed involve issues in dynamical systems, singular perturbation theory, spectral theory of linear operators, nonlinear partial differential equations, and rigorous scientific computation, and should result in the development of new mathematical tools of general application. In particular, development of dynamical systems tools for kinetic shock and boundary layer problems would unify and extend results obtained for Boltzmann phenomena by the ""Kyoto School"" of Sone et al using a variety of formal and analytic methods. Likewise, the introduction of new inviscid stability criteria for roll waves and of Kreiss symmetrizer techniques for analysis of modulated fronts open new directions in the study of periodic modulation. The problem on galloping detonations, if solved, will answer a longstanding question, while associated rigorous Wensel,Kramers, and Brillouin method developments will be of wide general use.

An early discovery of modern physics was that this state of affairs is very much different at the subatomic level. In particular, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics asserts that it is impossible to simultaneously determine the position and momentum of a quantum particle with arbitrary precision.  In 1926, von Neumann laid the precise mathematical foundation for what it is that can actually be measured in the case of a subatomic particle. This work involved the use of operators, linear transformations acting on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Operator theory, the branch of modern mathematics that studies operators, has subsequently developed to become a far-reaching area of research in pure mathematics, and numerous additional applications throughout mathematics, physics, and engineering have been discovered. This research project involves the development of new techniques within operator theory as well as the application of established techniques to attack a number of questions involving the theory of functions. While it is not the primary focus of the project, the research has many potential applications to mathematical physics, control theory, and the theory of optimization.<br/> <br/>A pillar of modern operator theory is the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem, which models contractions acting on Hilbert space by extending them to co-isometries acting on larger spaces. This theorem and its numerous refinements open the door to studying holomorphic functions in one and several variables through the use of operator-theoretic methods. This project studies a variety of problems in several complex variables and other areas of analysis using these operator-theoretic methods. In particular, operator-theoretic methods will be employed to study: interpolation problems of Nevanlinna-Pick and Cartheodory-Fejer type; the boundary behavior of analytic functions defined on polydiscs and poly-halfplanes; the derivation and descriptive theory of extremal holomorphic mappings arising from the Caratheodory and Kobayashi extremal problems; and the canonical derivation of representation formulae for analytic functions  in specific classes such as the Schur, Herglotz, Pick, Loewner, Bessmertnyi, and Stieltjes classes on domains in several variables. A related focus of the research is to apply modifications of the modeling methods to develop the theory of analytic functions on varieties in commuting variables and on free domains in several non-commuting variables."

Some of these areas of high societal impact include social and behavioral research, forensic sciences, early detection of covert communications and breaches in data security, early-warning systems for identifying outbreaks of infectious diseases, cognitive development studies in children, and drug discovery, among many others. In many of these areas, commonly-used statistical methods make strong assumptions about the data-generating distribution. Such simplistic approaches may be unjustified; moreover, even if these assumptions make sense, they need to be tested. This research project investigates a powerful alternative to these existing methods and aims to develop a fundamental theoretical understanding of the same, leading to novel statistical applications. Code for algorithms that result from this project will be made publicly available for ready use.<br/><br/>The kernel method is a class of statistical methodology that has gained popularity in statistical learning due to its ability to handle both high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. The core idea of the method is to map observed data to a function space, called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which allows capture of non-linear relationships in the data. This project concerns theoretical and methodological research on a generalization of this method by embedding probability measures in an RKHS. This generalization has wide applicability in statistical learning problems such as nonparametric hypothesis testing, density estimation, and regression on distributions, which will be explored in this project. On the theoretical front, the characterization of injectivity of kernel embedding will be considered. While such a characterization is well understood for kernels defined on locally compact Abelian groups and compact non-Abelian groups, this project will investigate the injectivity of the kernel embedding for non-standard spaces such as nuclear spaces, the space of graphs, and the positive definite cone. The injectivity of the embedding is known to be related to the richness of the RKHS in approximating a certain class of functions. The research will investigate the rate of this approximation, which turns out to be critical in analyzing the convergence rates of kernel-based regression and density estimators and separation rates in hypothesis testing. An injective embedding induces a metric, called the kernel distance on the space of probabilities, which is defined as the RKHS distance between the kernel embeddings of two probability measures. The investigator will study the relation of kernel distance to other probability metrics such as the energy distance, distance covariance, f-divergence, and integral probability metrics in order to understand the statistical/computational (dis)advantages associated with these distances. These theoretical studies have an applied counterpart, wherein the RKHS embedding plays a critical role in the problems of regression on probability measures and density estimation in infinite dimensional exponential families. For these problems, the investigator plans to develop computationally efficient estimators with theoretical guarantees. Overall, the project aims to develop a comprehensive theory of RKHS embedding of probability measures with applications to problems in statistical learning."

The MC/MCMC methods have revolutionized statistics, allowing statisticians to model and solve complex and high-dimensional problems that would have been intractable using conventional techniques. One drawback of these methods is that very many observations or data samples are needed due to the slow convergence rate inherent in random sampling. This becomes an issue when the sampling is expensive. The deterministic method under study in this project attempts to overcome this problem by sampling points more intelligently, so that the same information provided by a random sample can be obtained with fewer deterministic samples. This can significantly cut down the cost of sampling and subsequent computations. The method under development has applications in many fields, such as uncertainty quantification, computer experiments, and machine learning.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide deterministic samples obtained through the minimization of certain energies. The goal is to use carefully developed optimization techniques to reduce the number of expensive evaluations of a probability distribution, thereby reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the deterministic sample provides a much better representative set of points for the distribution, which can further reduce the cost of subsequent computations involving integrals. Compared to the existing Quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which are mostly developed for sampling from the uniform hypercube, the methods under study are much more general and can be used to directly sample from any probability distribution. Two methods for deterministic sampling will be investigated. The first method, known as minimum energy designs, is useful when the probability density is expensive to evaluate. The second method, known as support points, is useful when the integrand is expensive but sampling from the probability density is easy. The minimum energy design possesses an important property: its empirical distribution asymptotically converges to the target distribution. This is a property not shared by some of the competing representative point sets in the literature, such as principal points. On the other hand, support points are obtained by minimizing an energy distance which is used for goodness-of-fit testing. In this light, support points can be viewed as point sets that optimally compact a continuous probability distribution. The project focuses on developing efficient optimization methods for these energy functions using as few function evaluations as possible, and improving the distributional properties of the point sets so that they can be used in problems where MC/MCMC methods are computationally impracticable."

The key task of liposomes (storage and delivery to targets) requires them to be flexible enough to merge with target membranes in order to deliver their cargos, and yet to have sufficient structural stability to maintain integrity without rupturing and losing the stored material in the naturally dynamic biological environments.  Therefore,  understanding the mechanics of liposomes is of great interest to both fundamental and applied scientists who are developing artificial, biomimetic liposomes as targeted drug/gene delivery systems for better therapeutics. A major challenge however, is the lack of efficient engineering tools to probe the mechanical flexibility of the sub-cellular, nanoscale liposomes. The research addresses this need by developing a novel method based on nanopore technology that uses electric fields to deform liposomes and electrical measurements to characterize their shape. The overall goal is to characterize the mechanical flexibility of nano-liposomes with the ultimate goal to establish a method to study mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as  viruses and other biological samples at cellular/molecular level.<br/><br/>This project will advance the engineering tools for mechanical characterization of soft biological materials at the micro/nanoscale. The technology uses nanopore resistive pulse sensing to detect membrane deformation. As liposomes translocate through a nanopore, they experience strong electric stresses and physical confinement, which cause deformation. In this project, liposome shapes will be inferred from ionic current blockade, i.e., the sharp change (pulse) in ohmic resistance when a liposome is present in the pore. A theoretical model for liposome deformation in the nanopore will be developed to yield membrane mechanical properties. The method will enable both high-throughput and single-particle resolution because  (1) thousands of liposomes pass through the nanopore and a resistive pulse will be recorded for each individual one, and (2) thousands of measurements on a single liposome can be made by alternating the applied electric field direction to drive back-and-forth translocation. In broader terms, this method will enable studying mechanobiology at novel unprecedented scales, which is single-virus and single-particle level."

These activities lead to inefficient decisions, such as low savings, and the way to overcome TICs is to design contracts that force people to ""commit"" to their plans.  This proposal looks at a new breed of TICs that people often do not want to commit to avoiding.  Unlike usual TICs, this research will study temptations that are social rather than private. A large component of acting fairly or generously is the result of social pressures to give or to appear generous.  These social pressures are felt at the time of the decision to give, while the joy of giving is not felt until the actual gift is transacted.  People may be tempted to promise to give because of the social pressure to appear generous but may not follow through when the time comes to give. This TIC need not be cured by commitment plans, but by giving people the flexibility to break with their plans.  This research will study how one can tell which cause of TIC is at work, and how best to improve people's outcomes.  Understanding this new breed of TICs will lead to better decisions, such as increased savings, investment in education, and policy formulation, thus improving the living standards of U.S. citizens and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.<br/><br/>The literature on TICs assumes that plans for the future are made free from present bias which can only be overcome by commitment plans.  The idea behind this research is that the same behavior?stating and breaking a plan?can come from two equally natural and intuitive models, but one is best cured by commitment while the other requires flexibility.  Besides the usual TICs resulting from ""present bias"", some people make commitment for the future they do not intend to follow through because of social pressure. Efficient policy to deal with this type of time inconsistent choice is to allow for flexibility to opt out of the commitment. This research will develop models and conduct experiments to distinguish between the two sources of TICs.  The ideas developed will be applied to several areas, such as charitable giving and notions of fairness and justice, where social pressures are important.  The research will use a combination of laboratory and field experiments, and economic theory to develop hypotheses and tests.  The results of this research will help us better understand the issues of time-inconsistent choices and help provide better contract design to improve social outcomes.  The results are also applicable to several areas of economics and other social sciences."

The main goals of statistical mechanics are to describe large-scale behavior and phase transitions through mathematical methods. One of the most interesting and important types of behavior is when an external force, such as an imposed boundary condition or other constraint, results in a non-homogeneity in the resulting ensemble. A simple example of this is the water/ice transition under a pressure gradient induced by gravity. The principal investigator proposes to study mathematical models of such behavior in a variety of basic settings, in hopes of understanding their common features and to be able to predict similar behavior in other potentially more complex systems.<br/><br/>The notion of limit shape in probability describes the property of large random systems to settle into a fixed, nonrandom state in the limit of large system size. Typically limit shapes arise due to a combination of entropic considerations and energy minimization. Several diverse areas where limit shapes have been shown to arise are in the theory of random graphs with subgraph density constraints, random tilings with imposed boundary conditions, and random configurational models such as ""square ice."" These examples are all studied through variational formulations. By studying their common features the PI hopes to learn more about the limit shape phenomenon in general."

The poster session will be used to encourage all participants, especially the junior researchers, to present their research and interact with others. <br/> <br/>A rapid growth of functional data in all disciplines, ranging from natural and social sciences to engineering and technology, has made FDA an important topic of research. To handle the diverse challenges facing FDA, there is a need to exploit low-dimensional patterns and structures present in functional data. Geometry provides tools to: (1) extract and analyze structures in functional data, (2) handle the infinite-dimensionality of function spaces, (3) arrive at viable statistical models and make efficient inferences; and (4) process large datasets associated with many current and future data-centric applications.  The workshop will include both: (1) theoretical topics, such as geometries of infinite-dimensional spaces, analysis under invariant metrics, and statistical models involving functional data; and (2) applications, such as computational anatomy, bioinformatics, biometrics, and neuroscience. This blend of important and complementary topics makes the workshop a unique and worthwhile event.  For more information about the workshop, please refer to https://ani.stat.fsu.edu/GFDW/"

The project seeks to learn whether such information can be used to blackmail politicians to make policy concessions, or whether previously undisclosed information about human rights abuses can jeopardize a new democracy's chances of survival.  This line of research marks a new direction in comparative politics that examines the relationship between transitional justice (TJ) and the quality of democratic representation. It focuses on policies aimed at vetting political candidates for acts of collaboration with the authoritarian regime, and possible human rights violations committed in the past. This process is known as lustration. In this respect, revealing evidence of past authoritarian wrongs may prevent former authoritarian elites from influencing policy in new democracies.  In preliminary work, the Principal Investigator shows that former authoritarian elites' influence tends to decrease with severity of transitional justice, but increases as voters view politicians' involvement with the former authoritarian regime as an important issue. The work also suggests that the effectiveness of TJ policies is reduced in the absence of a free press, as the media's inability to uncover empty threats which allows former autocrats to extract policy concessions. Surprisingly, the magnitude of ideological differences between current politicians and successors of authoritarian elites has no bearing on the ability of former autocrats to extract such concessions.  This research will work to develop stronger measure of TJ severity to help evaluate how transitional justice can contribute to stable democratic transitions. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The research project will result in the creation of two novel datasets constructed to test the empirical implications of a formal theoretical model about the effects of transitional justice (TJ).  The research will analyze time series cross-sectional data to assess the role of lustration in post-authoritarian states and truth commissions in post-conflict states play in democratic consolidation. Second, the research will generate data that tracks the presence of former authoritarian elites in political parties and in the non-political sector. The overarching goal of this project is to understand how policies that increase transparency of the political process improve the quality of democratic representation in new democracies. This research will shed light on the importance of institutions accompanying transitional justice, specifically a free media, by demonstrating that lustration has the intended effect only under a precise set of conditions in the author's theoretical model. This is the first study that goes beyond studying de jure TJ institutions to study de facto TJ.  It does so by seeking to uncover the prevalence of authoritarian elites holding positions of influence following the implementation of personnel TJ. By exploring the value of revealing secret authoritarian legacies, it studies the logic of forward-looking arguments in support of TJ. In contrast to normative arguments in favor of TJ as punishing authoritarian wrong-doing, this project focuses on the truth revealing aspect of TJ and investigates whether such truth revelation enhances democratic representation."

It will create strategies for teaching a diverse set of students, including students with learning disabilities, English language learners, and students with a variety of ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds. It will draw on decades of research on reading comprehension to drive our exploration into metacognitive learning strategies for computer science. While many computer science educational activities focus on older students, this project addresses the need to enhance computer science education for elementary school students and does it in a way that is accessible and effective for diverse student populations.  The researchers will explore how reading skills, reading comprehension, and computer programming skills can be related. The ultimate goal will be to identify and develop techniques, including teacher and student resources, for learning to program in the early years. The strategies involved in the project support improving computer science instruction and expanding access to computing for all students. <br/><br/>This project will study skills that are correlated with success in programming, especially as they relate to reading comprehension and metacognitive strategies. It will then modify and pilot-test strategies for use in programming instruction. More specifically, the goals of this project are to: (1) Assess a variety of skills and abilities (e.g. reading comprehension, mathematics, and cognitive skills) to correlate with successfully learning programming. (2) Explore metacognitive strategies used by successful college-level novice programmers. (3) Perform a theoretical analysis of several existing metacognitive learning strategies and how they relate to code comprehension. (4) Develop two promising metacognitive strategies as code comprehension strategies, including teacher modeling and guided instruction resources as well as student resources. (5) Implement new strategies in the classroom to evaluate for usability, fidelity, and impact.  This project represents foundational work in understanding the relationship between non-programming skills and learning programming in upper elementary students, as well as the metacognitive strategies that successful learners employ while reading code during the programming learning process.

The project will use the 1982 U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) as a kind of ""natural experiment"" to examine how and why rates and type of urban development have differed depending on whether the coastal areas were affected by the act, which eliminated federal funding for infrastructure in designated coastal areas along the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico without prohibiting development.  The project will enhance general knowledge about the factors influencing development and redevelopment of coastal areas by identifying the interrelated and conflicting motivations of different organizations involved in the urban development process.  It will address theoretical debates about future legal frameworks that could mirror the CBRA to protect wetlands, floodplains, endangered species habitat, and other areas experiencing severe future risk from changing environmental conditions.  Project findings will be shared with policy makers and coastal managers through a professional toolkit that will explain results and suggest best practices for coastal development and infrastructure decisions.  Findings also will be transformed into educational materials for use in high schools across North Carolina and the U.S. <br/><br/>Urban development relies on numerous factors, including federal assistance with infrastructure development, whether through roads, utilities, or other major investments.  Although the CBRA attempted to reduce incentives for development in areas that were extremely vulnerable to natural hazards, such as areas subject to hurricanes or storm surges development still has occurred in these areas.  The investigators will focus on the key tension created by the CBRA, as increased infrastructure costs may be offset by local permitting and infrastructure funding as well as premiums placed on seclusion promoted by the act.  They will seek to ascertain to what extent development has occurred in coastal areas where public infrastructure, disaster relief, and flood insurance subsidies have been withdrawn.  They will examine how these development rates compare to coastal areas with continued subsidies, and they will identify whether there are economic or population growth thresholds for which withdrawal of federal funding has no effect on development rates, and they will assess how local land-use, infrastructure, and permitting decisions interact with and possibly offset restrictions on federal subsidies.  The investigators will evaluate the rates, types, and intensities of residential development in units affected by the CBRA and adjoining, non-affected areas throughout Alabama, Delaware, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  They will use a quasi-experimental framework based on a matched pair analysis to understand the impacts of various factors.  Focused case studies will then explore why some units affected by the CBRA have developed and others have not."

One of the reasons invasive shrubs may impact native ecosystems so greatly is that they have an extended period with leaves, as compared to native woody species, also called extended leaf phenology (ELP). Phenology is the timing of biological phenomena that correspond to climatic conditions. This earlier leaf emergence in the spring and/or later leaf fall in the autumn creates shade at unique times of the year. So far, studies comparing ELP of invasive compared to native shrubs have been done at single locations. However, we know that cues that drive leaf phenology, for example temperature, vary greatly from region to region and from year to year. So, when we compare regions across the eastern U.S., will we find differences in leaf phenology between native and invasive shrubs? Are there regions where it is important to focus management efforts because ELP of invading shrubs  is greater? How will leaf phenology change with temperature changes? To address these questions, researchers have developed a citizen science campaign called ""Shady Invaders"" to collect leaf phenology observations across the eastern U.S. Through participant training and eNewsletter and webinar updates, both the public and scientific research are enriched from this collaboration. <br/><br/><br/>Species-specific leaf phenology data are impossible to collect simultaneously across a regional scale without numerous observers. Fortunately, data collection is straightforward, allowing the growing efforts of citizen scientists to be applied to this problem. Regional citizen science phenology observations for native and invasive shrubs will provide insight into the spatial extent and consistency of the novel leaf phenology of invasive shrubs across eastern U.S. and will contribute to our understanding of the broader applicability of local-scale research on this topic. The landscape-scale, multi-year approach can be used to predict the potential implications of climate change for leaf phenology by developing a predictive model for phenology. Through collaboration with researchers from China, phenology data are being incorporated from the native range of the shrub species invading forests of eastern U.S. to understand whether novel phenology arose as a product of evolutionary pressures in the native range (pre-adaptation), or more recently in the introduced range (rapid adaptation with range expansion). This will contribute to pressing research questions as well as informing whether leaf phenology is a useful tool for predicting and preventing future invasions."

These communities, known as microbiomes, carry out a cascade of chemical reactions that break down (ferment) the plant fiber. By-products of fermentation can be absorbed as nutrients by the animal or be further processed by microbes. This ultimately leads to the production of carbon dioxide and methane, potent greenhouse gases that then go into the atmosphere. Studies have shown that there is much variation among individual animals in the way energy from the fermentation process flows through their microbiomes. This project will look at these differences and their consequences: how the chemical reactions can differ, be performed by different microbes in the communities, have different effects on fermentation, and in some cases, differ in whether they favor animal feeding efficiency over methane production or the other way around. The more detailed understanding of the ecological interactions and their functional impacts in microbiomes of the rumen that will result from this work will help researchers identify better microbiome control strategies and develop more targeted intervention techniques to increase food security in a more environmentally sustainable manner. Students will be trained, and international and cross-disciplinary collaborations will be fostered.<br/> <br/>This project will bring together microbial genomics, anaerobic microbiology and microbial community ecology to study ecological interactions among the microbial species in the rumen, and how they control the establishment of alternative microbiomes with different functional efficiencies. Researchers will reveal the community assembly dynamics of the microbiome in high temporal and genetic resolution, and identify the potential for alternative community states to assemble in the rumen via priority effects. Priority effects occur when certain species precondition future states of the community due to their ecological interactions, stimulating the growth of a specific subset of species and inhibiting others. Researchers will then map resulting community composition differences to changes in the metabolic efficiency of the rumen microbiome. Through these efforts, they will establish the links between community structure and inter-species interactions, mainly happening at micro-scales, and important ecosystem functions such as the degradation of plant fiber material in the cow rumen."

Dr. Zaera's goal is to design a catalyst that can bring about the reaction of carbon-oxygen (C=O) bonds to alcohols, without affecting other bonds in the molecule.  He performs a three-pronged approach to understand the mechanisms in these reactions; kinetic measurements on model systems with few, well-defined surface sites that probe the surface-layer composition and reactivity of the Cu-Pt materials under well-defined, low-pressure conditions; reactions performed on model catalysts and reactions under actual catalytic conditions and; studies with well-defined, supported catalysts that most closely resemble industrial catalysts in their structure and complexity.  Broader impacts of this work result from an enhanced fundamental understanding of the molecule-level chemistry of mixed-metal surfaces.  The knowledge deriving from this work has broader impact in education as well, by providing data to illustrate basic principles in kinetics and catalysis for undergraduate and graduate classes.

One of the major challenges in catalysis is to achieve high selectivity toward the desired products. It has been shown that selectivity may be controlled by mixing two or more metals, an approach that is used in many industrial applications but not fully understood. The focus of this proposal is to help resolve some pending issues associated with bimetallic catalysis, including the determination of the contributions of electronic versus geometrical effects and the identification of the most active surface in terms of the degree of metal intermixing and the oxidation states of the constituent elements.  Dr. Zaera combines fundamental surface-science studies on the mechanistic details of the reactions with the design and evaluation of realistic catalysts. . Three types of interconnected experiments are involved : (1) kinetic measurements on model systems using high-flux molecular beams to emulate close-to-atmospheric pressures locally at specific surfaces while maintaining the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment necessary for their controlled preparation and characterization; (2) research of model systems in operando mode by combining kinetic measurements with mass spectrometry detection and characterization of the surface intermediates using infrared absorption spectroscopy; and (3) kinetic measurements with well-defined supported catalysts made by using colloidal and other nanotechnologies.

Unfortunately, these small grain sizes are energetically unfavorable as compared to larger sized grains. Upon heating, the smaller grains will grow to reduce this energy difference which results in the loss of strength. In recent years, the development of specific types of alloys has shown that the lower concentration atom type, or solute, can stabilize these grains against this growth. An outcome of these observations has been various models to explain the grain size stabilization. However, these models have several fundamental scientific gaps that still remain to be solved. For example, the modeled grain boundaries are considered equivalent wherein reality grain boundaries are diverse in their structure, energy, and mobility. The lack of experimental verification of this solute specific segregation to grain boundaries has hindered further model development. This research will overcome these prior limitations by combining electron microscopy and atom probe tomography to detect solute segregation to those specific boundaries. These results will then be forward fed to atomics models that explain this diversity of behavior. This research will be integrated into various outreach activities, including a summer materials camp for secondary education teachers to introduce materials science into the middle/high school classrooms. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>Nano-crystalline materials is an area of active research owing to their unique size dependent properties. Since interfaces (boundaries) constitute a large fraction of the entire structure, the corresponding interfacial energy from those boundaries can make these grains inherently unstable. Solute partitioning to these boundaries has been devised as a means to stabilize these grains against growth with concepts of kinetic solute drag effects and thermodynamic reduction of interfacial energy being suggested mechanisms for stabilization. To date, these models assume all the grain boundaries are isotropic and equivalent to each other; in reality grain boundaries are diverse in energy, structure, and mobility with solute partitioning being a function of that variability. Using cross-correlative precession electron diffraction and atom probe tomography, this research will elucidate the solute specificity to grain boundaries that leads to stabilization. The experimental findings will be linked to hydride Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics atomistic models that will elucidate the mechanisms of stabilization to specific boundary types.    In addition, real-time experimental quantification of those boundaries during annealing will be measured to ascertain mobility and kinetic contributors to stability. The collective results will bridge outstanding and fundamental knowledge gaps in revealing how thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for specific grain boundaries leads to grain size stability. This research will be seamlessly integrated to various outreach activities to strengthen the STEM disciplines including a summer materials camp for secondary education teachers to introduce materials science into middle/high school classrooms."

Passive-solar-design seeks to balance heat loss through the building envelope with solar energy input, while also using thermal mass, shading, and/or ventilation to dampen daily thermal swings. However, implementation of current passive-solar-design tends to be highly context-specific and often entails use of costly mechanical devices and controls.  This project aims to study an innovative passive solar building enclosure system that uses cellular solid-solid phase change materials (SS-PCM) with variable transparency. The system relies on passive material-enabled controls and has no mechanically moving parts or electrical components. Successful implementation of SS-PCM foam-based building envelope materials can result in low cost responsive building enclosure systems that self-regulate building thermal comfort. The outcome of this study can lead to new technologies that reduce energy use in buildings, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and improve the economic competitiveness of the United States. This study is also expected to result in benefits to diverse industries such as building materials, construction, and energy conservation. An innovative outreach plan will be implemented in the form of a competition that engages students at various levels of education in the topics of passive solar design, energy use, and thermal comfort in buildings.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to uncover the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of translucent cellular SS-PCM systems used in realistic building envelopes. Fundamental insights will be gained on (1) heat transfer phenomena occurring in SS-PCM foam systems, (2) the synergistic effects occurring between three material-enabled solar-light irradiation control mechanisms, and (3) structural features and characteristics that lead to high energy-savings in buildings. This study will create enabling knowledge on thermal and optical behavior of SS-PCMs such that building temperatures can be passively regulated year-round under different climate conditions. An integrated experimental and computational program, consisting of multi-physics modeling, materials synthesis, system level integration, and building level evaluation for energy saving, will be performed to achieve the aforementioned goal. This project can transform the use of PCM by relying on radiation energy transfer processes to deliver heat, thus bypassing the low thermal conductivity problem inherent to PCMs. The low thermal conductivity of the SS-PCM foam also delays heat-loss, thus enhancing the ability of the system to remain at a desired temperature."

When one individual in a population acquires a beneficial mutation, that mutation may eventually spread to a large fraction of the population, or even the entire population. Modeling this phenomenon mathematically becomes particularly challenging when there can be many different beneficial mutations in the population at a time. This research project studies mathematical models of evolving populations that repeatedly acquire beneficial mutations.  Because, in these models, populations are assumed to evolve in a random way, the theory of probability plays a central role in the analysis. The research aims to provide mathematical insight into important biological problems. Questions of interest include determining the rate at which the fitness of the population increases as a result of beneficial mutations, understanding the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population at a given time, and understanding how to describe the genealogy of a sample from the population. <br/><br/>To model populations undergoing selection, the investigator will consider a stochastic process called branching Brownian motion. Each particle dies at a given rate, each particle moves independently according to one-dimensional Brownian motion, and particles occasionally split into two.  Here particles represent individuals in a population, and the position of the particle along the real line corresponds to the individual's fitness.  It will be assumed that the branching rate depends on the position of the particle, so that individuals with higher fitness have more offspring.  It is conjectured that in the long-run, the empirical distribution of the positions of the particles is approximately Gaussian. A proof of this result would provide a mathematically rigorous formulation of the idea, well-established in the biology literature, that for certain populations undergoing selection, the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the population evolves like a Gaussian traveling wave.  Because branching Brownian motion can be used to model populations experiencing either beneficial or deleterious mutations, this work could also shed light on a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet, which refers to the decrease in the fitness of a population resulting from the accumulation of deleterious mutations. The investigator will also consider some population models that incorporate the effects of recombination, as well as a nested coalescent model that describes the genealogy of a collection of individuals sampled from multiple species."

The principal investigator  will develop some  fundamental  methods to understand  the spectra and quantum dynamical behavior of Schrodinger operators. In particular, the project focuses on the conductance properties and transport  of quasi-periodic media. The results not only provide a good explanation for some phenomena in physics and chemistry,  but may also have fruitful applications to modern engineering devices such as semiconductors. Undergraduate and graduate students will have opportunities to participate in some of the research.<br/><br/>This project aims at studying several aspects in mathematics by methods of functional, harmonic and geometric analysis. Quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators describe the conductivity of electrons in a two-dimensional crystal layer subject to an external magnetic field of flux  acting perpendicular to the lattice plane. The principal investigator will investigate the spectral theory of quasi-periodic operators, including spectral transitions, structure of eigenfunctions in the pure point spectrum regime, and quantum dynamics of spectral measures in the singular continuous spectrum regime. The principal investigator will also study the spectral theory of Laplacians on noncompact complete Riemannian manifolds.  The focus is on the existence of eigenvalues or singular continuous spectra embedded into essential spectra of Laplacians on asymptotically flat and on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as characterized by the radial curvature. The goal is to better understand relations between geometric quantities and properties of eigensolutions. Lastly the principal investigator plan to study the independence of  the time-frequency translates  of various classes of functions,  which is stated as HRT conjecture.  The priority is to prove the HRT conjecture for  special configurations and HRT conjecture for exponentially decaying functions."

Phosphorus is vital not only for food production but also for other agricultural commodities such as ethanol, biofuels, and any biorenewable chemicals. Phosphorus availability is a looming crisis even more severe than dwindling supplies of fossil fuels, simply because no alternative for this element exists. The ultimate goal of this project is to induce a shift in current phosphorus research, and hopefully industry, toward more sustainable practices. The aim is to circumvent traditional phosphorus starting materials, such as PCl3, whose transformation into the desired chemicals produces an enormous amount of waste as well as being extremely energy-inefficient. The laboratory of the PI is a joint venture between UCSD and the French CNRS. It serves to promote the exchange of undergraduates and graduates between UCSD and European Universities.<br/><br/>PCl3 features a phosphorus center, which can be viewed as a P3+ synthetic equivalent. The aim of this project is to develop stable sustainable ""P¯"" building blocks, including PN2¯ and P3¯, phosphorus-containing analogues of the azide anion (N3¯). Through reaction with electrophiles (E+), these building blocks will lead to highly reactive phosphinidenes (E-P), including their room temperature stable version. This monocoordinated phosphorus species, isoelectronic with carbenes, will readily be transformed into a broad range of phosphorus compounds, including artificial allotropes of phosphorus. The ""P¯"" synthetic equivalents will also be used for the preparation of RNP2 and RP3, which are di- and tri-phosphorus analogues of azido derivatives, as well as R2C=P2 which are diphosphorus analogues of diazo derivatives. These compounds will not only act as 1,3-dipoles allowing for the preparation of a variety of phosphorus heterocycles, but will also be generators of the highly reactive dinuclear P2, which will be chemically trapped. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits, and since this project is at the interface between physical, organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, it is well suited to the education of chemists at all levels. This project will contribute to the education of four Graduate Students, three of whom are minorities, and the first of their family to earn an undergraduate degree."

Traits also shape how people respond to us. One trait that is important for the quality of our relationships and well-being is neuroticism, the opposite of which is emotional stability. Neuroticism is defined as the tendency to react with strong and intense negative emotion to everyday experiences of threat, loss, and frustration. This trait has been linked to poor relationships and well-being. This project tests novel hypotheses about the role of culture in reducing vulnerability to negative relationship and well-being outcomes for those higher in neuroticism. The hypotheses are tested using various methods including daily experience, behavioral observation, and physiological stress reactivity within experimental and longitudinal research designs. The results of this project will innovatively inform how culture and processes linked to culture (such as social support) can enhance relationship quality and well-being.<br/><br/>The responses of others play an important role in the association of neuroticism with poor relationship quality and well-being. Recent studies by the researcher, Belinda Campos of the University of California Irvine, indicate that the poor outcomes typically associated with neuroticism are reduced in Latinas, a group whose culture distinctively emphasizes four characteristics in relationships: interdependence, physical proximity, social support, and positive emotion. This project examines the influence of culture on the association of neuroticism with adverse outcomes. The proposed research tests the novel hypothesis that distinctive features of Latino culture shape social responses, including acceptance and support, that are protective for those who have high levels of neuroticism. Hypotheses will be tested by examining everyday experience and social behavior in three cultures (Latino, Asian, European) in a longitudinal  study of same-culture, same-sex dyads. The influence of culture on relationship quality, well-being and physiological responses will be examined. This work innovatively investigates the complex interplay of personality, culture, and social processes. It will lead to discoveries of social processes that are protective for some people from interdependent cultures. These social and behavioral processes may be leveraged to enhance the well-being of all."

For any of these fields, it is crucial to be able to monitor and predict the power and laser properties to avoid excessive tissue or material damage. As these lasers feature extremely short pulse durations (on the order of femtoseconds) which exceed the fastest electronic characterization instruments, an existing challenge is to capture the pulse-to-pulse evolution in real-time. The goal of this proposal is to develop new real-time optical characterization methods that can provide insight into the pulse-by-pulse behavior and characterize novel lasers states. These methods can enable new modulation schemes in communication systems while having fundamental impact on laser development and optimization. In addition, the proposed real-time characterization methods can provide powerful analysis tools for continuous monitoring of cell mechanisms, fluid dynamics or chemical reaction kinetics. <br/>This project also provides an opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students at the intersection of laser physics, systems engineering, materials science, and real-time characterization to build a new generation of multi-faceted researchers to tackle the interdisciplinary nature of technological and societal challenges in the future.

A modified time-stretching technique based on dispersive Fourier transform is to be developed to capture pulse behavior on a single pulse scale. Systematic studies aimed at resolving the intricate interplay between different pulse shaping mechanisms in fibers will lead to fundamental insights into pulse dynamics and transient states that can be applied to design novel laser cavities, resolve polarization evolution and optimize performance parameters."

More specifically, it focuses on the study of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are a very special class of functions that form an important bridge connecting the discrete objects of algebraic number theory and the continuous objects of analytic number theory. Automorphic forms are used as tools to study number theoretic functions, e.g. by measuring their rates of growth, discovering formulas for them, or proving relations that they satisfy. Classically, special values of automorphic forms provided the solution to Kronecker's problem for extensions of the rational numbers that do not lie in the real line. More recently, automorphic forms played a pivotal role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. This project aims to further explore the connection of automorphic forms to other mathematical structures.<br/><br/>The main object of the proposed research is to further understand and exploit the relationship between automorphic forms and quadratic number fields. This relationship is exceedingly rich and unites the study of diverse objects such as Heegner points, closed geodesics, the hyperbolic Laplacian, Kloosterman sums, L-functions and class fields. The theory for imaginary quadratic fields is in general better developed and simpler, especially in relation to class field theory. The investigators will concentrate mostly on the real quadratic case. In one direction, they will study some new geometric invariants associated to real quadratic fields that were introduced recently. These invariants are certain surfaces that are bounded by modular closed geodesics. The investigators will study the distribution of the areas of the surfaces, especially as this relates to ideal classes and also investigate some new geometric problems about the closed geodesics. They plan to express various invariants for real quadratic fields (such as surface integrals of modular functions) in terms of the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms. This naturally leads to problems involving sums of Kloosterman sums and to extensions of recent work on uniform estimates for such sums."

The general goal of this project is to extend this class of well-understood equations. Building on earlier work relevant for applications to physics, control theory, and materials science, this project aims to apply a variety of recently-developed methods to study longstanding questions of intrinsic mathematical interest. The work is anticipated to further improve understanding of the qualitative features of analytic functions defined by some basic differential equations arising in mathematical physics and geometry.<br/><br/>Most of the special functions of mathematical physics are defined by linear differential equations with at most three singularities. Solutions of the Heun equation (with four regular singularities) and the Painlevé VI equation (non-linear, with four fixed singularities and no movable singularities) lie on the boundary of the class of special functions. Because of their intrinsic mathematical interest and numerous applications in science, they have been extensively studied since the beginning of the 20th century. This research project aims to advance understanding of these important functions through the use of new geometric methods. The main topics of this project are the qualitative study of real solutions of the Painlevé VI equation, the study of Riemannian metrics of constant positive curvature with conic singularities, with the emphasis on the metrics with four singularities closely related to the Heun equation, and finally the study of the eigenvalues of some parity-time symmetric anharmonic oscillators."

This project's goal is to study solar cells made from plastics and organic molecules, which could allow solar cells to be as thin and inexpensive as a coat of paint.  Plastic/organic solar-cell materials have been studied for a long time, but how these materials convert light into electricity at the molecular level remains poorly understood.  To better understand these materials we are developing a microscope capable of watching charge move at the molecular level on the timescale of one nanosecond (one billionth of a second) or faster.  Such a microscope would give us a new way to study molecular-level processes ranging from photosynthesis to industrially important chemical reactions taking place at a metal surface.

Localized measurements of charge recombination dynamics and charge mobility are carried out on donor-acceptor blends prepared from molecules with systematically varied energy levels and background charge density to support or refute theories describing how charge is generated from sunlight in these blends.  To enable these studies, scanned-probe-microscope measurements are developed capable of determining, with nanosecond temporal resolution and nanometer spatial resolution, the free charge yield and subsequent recombination dynamics in a thin film of a donor-acceptor blend following the application of a nanosecond-duration pulse of light.  A separate set of scanned-probe measurements are developed for inferring the local charge mobility from measurements of near-surface electric field fluctuations.   The tools created during this project are expected to ultimately have broad applications in studying industrially important processes like photocatalysis and electrocatalysis and in naturally important processes like photosynthesis.

In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on them (the concept of ""measure"" generalizes the notions of length, area, and volume). In this project, the sort of set under consideration is typically the boundary (i.e., the enclosing perimeter) of some region in space, and for this a specific measure -- namely, ""harmonic measure""-- plays a central role.  Harmonic measure and its generalizations may be used to construct solutions in some region, with prescribed boundary values, to partial differential equations of so-called ""elliptic"" type.  Such equations govern various steady-state phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics and steady-state temperature distributions.   For example, harmonic measure may be used to determine the steady-state temperature distribution within some region, given a known temperature distribution on the perimeter of the region. Unsurprisingly, the geometry of the region and its boundary greatly affect one's ability to carry out such a program in practice.  A principal goal of this project is to quantify, in a natural sense, the connection between geometry and the behavior of harmonic measure and its generalizations.<br/><br/>The project has two main areas of focus. First, the principal investigator plans to find an intrinsically geometric characterization of quantitative absolute continuity of harmonic measure with respect to surface measure, on the boundary of an open set in d-dimensional Euclidean space.

Related to this work, the principal investigator also plans to investigate the analogous question concerning quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic-harmonic measure associated to a more general second-order elliptic operator.  Second, the principal investigator will study the solvability of other boundary value problems for elliptic equations, in several different settings.  More precisely, he intends to work toward an improved understanding of the Neumann problem in domains more general than Lipschitz domains and for nonsymmetric divergence form operators. As a first step, he plans to consider a certain family of transmission problems, for which the Neumann problem is an endpoint case. He also plans to treat boundary-value problems for certain higher-order divergence-form elliptic operators."

One key issue in the so called ""nuclear renaissance"" is materials development towards longer life time under harsh environments. In order to withstand neutron damage at high temperatures, various nanostructured materials have been developed by introducing defect sinks to absorb/remove defects. However, quantitative determination of defect sink strength is still a technological bottleneck.  This project uses an isotope labeling technique to quantitatively measure the sink strength in ion irradiated stainless steels as a key approach for a full scope investigation on defect-sink interactions.  Such capability is critical to develop radiation tolerant materials. Even for the same type of defect sinks, fine tuning of their microstructures to maximize sink strength requires knowledge of one-to-one correlation between structures and sink strength.  The study  will contribute to the general understanding of defects in metals.  The project offers students unique opportunities to combine training and research in nuclear engineering, nanomaterials, atomic scale characterization and atomic scale modeling, for solving issues of real-world importance.  <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>For Fe based stainless steels of nature Fe abundance, implantation of 57Fe isotope atoms will introduce 57Fe interstitials. Upon annealing, the amount of 57Fe enrichments at defect sinks directly reflects the sink strength for defect trapping. Hence the defect sink strength under different irradiation/annealing/stress conditions can be systematically studied. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography (APT) will be used to map 57Fe isotope distributions. APT is coupled with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 3-D TEM tomography to establish one-to-one correlation between defect sink structure and sink strength.  The project will study two defect sink types: (1) grain boundaries in grain-engineered stainless steels in order to understand effects of boundary misorientation angles on sink strength and (2) oxide particles in oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloys (ODS) in order to understand the effects of oxide-matrix interfaces on sink strength. The project further integrates molecular dynamics simulations to shed light onto fundamentals. The defect sink strength will be used as inputs in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for obtaining structural evolutions which can be linked to and compared with experimental observations. In conjunction with materials synthesis, modeling, and atomic scale characterization, the project will obtain the fundamental understanding needed to maximize radiation tolerance of reactor core components.

The technical approach will be based on the experience and theoretical/simulation capabilities developed by the PI. The proposed work will clarify the controlling deformation mechanisms through ultra-large-scale and high-resolution atomistic and dislocation dynamics simulations, interpret the experimental data and phenomena through continuum strain gradient plasticity and cohesive modeling of fatigue and fracture behavior, and guide further research in structural optimization and processing. The ultra-large scale simulations in the proposed work will be performed on the National Institute for Computational Sciences, and the rest of the proposed computational work will be performed at the Center for Computing and Visualization at Brown University. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art computational techniques."

Compared to portland cement concrete, geopolymers are more durable and less energy- and resource-intensive to manufacture due to their use of waste by-product materials. However, their widespread adoption is hindered due to a lack of understanding about geopolymer formation. Using a nondestructive microwave technique coupled with materials characterization methods, geopolymer reaction mechanisms can be studied and modeled, especially those involving water. The outcomes of the project will provide material design tools for geopolymers to become a staple material used to build the nation's future sustainable structures. This research will also improve the prediction of strength, durability, and early-age properties of current structural materials such as portland cement concrete and advance other future materials with similar compositions. Further, the microwave-based assessment technique evolved from this project will enable in-situ evaluation of materials that undergo a hardening reaction after placement in the field thereby offering structural health monitoring and enhancing the construction quality control. This work will also include mentoring a diverse team of researchers and development of outreach activities that support the success of Native American, minority, female, and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will advance the fundamental understanding of geopolymer reaction mechanisms, which is critical for the advancement of viable geopolymer compositions for use as sustainable structural materials. Microwave techniques will be used to discern changes in material properties through dielectric measurements. Dielectric mixing models will be corroborated with multi-scale materials characterization techniques to quantify changes in water binding and corresponding phase composition transformations in geopolymers. This multi-physics approach will culminate in two new material models. The first model will link the phase formation mechanisms that occur during geopolymerization reaction with setting, rheological, and mechanical behavior. The second model will extend Powers Model for cement hydration to alkali-activated materials. Such a model will allow materials engineers to optimize geopolymer microstructures based on composition and curing inputs. These models can be extended for other materials with calcium-silicate chemistries and variable water binding. This work will also lay the groundwork for in-situ test methods suitable for assessment of geopolymer maturity, thereby offering structural health monitoring and improved quality control."

Specific instances include biochemical reaction networks, high-tech manufacturing, computer systems, telecommunications, transportation and business service systems. The analysis and control of such complex stochastic networks require solving challenging mathematical problems. This award supports research on solving such mathematical problems. Some of the work involves the development of general theory for broad classes of stochastic networks, while others focus on mathematical problems directly motivated by specific applications. Since the complexity of stochastic networks usually precludes exact analysis of detailed ""microscopic"" models, the focus is on formulating and analyzing more tractable approximations. New techniques and results will be developed in such a way that they can be used by applied researchers in areas of application. The results of this research will be disseminated through publication in peer reviewed journals, by posting on the University of California's open access website and by presentations at mathematics, science and engineering conferences. The PI will help train new mathematics researchers through collaboration with early career researchers.<br/><br/>The research addresses mathematical problems associated with the analysis and control of stochastic network dynamics. Topics to be addressed include rigorous justification of approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate models, and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models. Two levels of approximation are considered: first order approximations called fluid models, and second order approximations which frequently are diffusion models. An important subtheme is understanding the interplay between levels of approximation. Five topics are proposed for study: diffusion approximations for (bio)chemical reaction networks, analysis of processor sharing networks, congestion control and resource entrainment in data networks, networks with random order of service and reneging, and dynamic control of stochastic processing networks. Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include rates of convergence in the approximation of density dependent Markov chains by reflected diffusion processes, analysis of measure-valued processes used to track residual job sizes or ages of jobs in stochastic network models with resource sharing, singular diffusion control problems, foundational questions for reflected processes, and numerical approximation of reflected diffusion processes in non-smooth domains. This award will support the training of early career researchers and underrepresented minorities through direct support of a female graduate student, and through collaboration of the PI with one early career researcher and one female researcher who is at a non-PhD granting institution."

Magnesium (Mg) is nearly four times lighter than steel and its ultra-low density and high specific strength make Mg alloys attractive lightweighting materials for commercial and defense platforms. However, the use of Mg has been inhibited by its limited ductility and formability, which is attributed to strong plastic anisotropy that results from its hexagonal crystal structure.  Recent gains in formability have been achieved through rare earth alloying, and this project will provide a detailed understanding of the influence that these rare earth elements have on the atomic-scale mechanisms that govern ductility and formability.  The insights obtained from this experimental study will accelerate alloy development and help promote cost-effective lightweighting in a wide variety of automotive, military and aerospace applications.

In the first, the PI will develop new and known connections between the orbits of Bianchi groups, which describe certain geometric aspects of imaginary quadratic fields, and elliptic curves with complex multiplication, thin groups, class groups, and abelian sandpiles.  In the second, the PI will extend the theory of elliptic nets to abelian varieties and investigate applications (including to pairing-based cryptography).  The third topic is the study of the security of the Ring-Learning-with-Errors problem as a basis for post-quantum cryptography.  This problem is an application of the geometric structure of lattices appearing in number fields.  The PI will investigate the extent of known and potential new attacks based on this number theoretical structure and compare these with known security parameters and suggested implementations.

(2) Explore metacognitive strategies used by successful college-level novice programmers. (3) Perform a theoretical analysis of several existing metacognitive learning strategies and how they relate to code comprehension.

Self-similar sets are sets that look exactly the same at different scales, such as the Koch snowflake fractal curve.  The more flexible notion of conformal self-similarity requires a set only to look roughly the same at different scales, allowing for changes of bounded distortion at each scale, such as is seen in Julia sets. Most sets observed in nature arise from processes involving randomness and satisfy the even weaker notion of ""stochastic self-similarity"": the random mechanism behind the set is the same at all scales.  This project aims at an understanding of basic properties of stochastically self-similar sets, particularly in relation to our knowledge of conformally self-similar sets.  A central role in the project is played by dendrites and the question of how such branching random fractals can be described using angle-preserving coordinate changes.<br/><br/>The Loewner differential equation is a basic tool in complex analysis that provides a bijection between two-dimensional (planar) non-self-crossing curves (such as Jordan curves) and real-valued driving functions.  The recently introduced ""Loewner energy"" of a Jordan curve can be defined as the Dirichlet energy of the driving function. It depends a priori on the initial point of the curve.  During this project several questions related to the regularity properties of curves of finite energy will be investigated, aiming at a more geometric definition of the energy and a proof of the independence of energy from the initial point.  Since curves of finite energy are known to be quasiconformal curves, the questions will be approached by methods from quasiconformal analysis, particularly holomorphic deformations and conformal welding.  A generalization of conformal welding leads to a description of dendrites via laminations.  This generalization will be explored both in the deterministic and in the stochastic setting."

Designing catalyst materials with structure and compositions tailored to accelerate the desired chemical transformations is an important area of chemical research.  In this project, a collaborative effort among Dr. Richard Hennig, Dr. Richard Robinson, and Dr. Jin Suntivich targets variation in composition and structure to create catalysts known as ""metastable catalysts"" since they fall outside of the normal solubility and structural ranges.

The surface hydrogen interaction is believed to play an important role in stabilizing the intermediates of the hydrogen evolution reaction and the selectivity of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This project exploits metastable oxysulfide nanocrystals as model systems with expanded compositional ranges to enable a systematic analysis of composition, surface interaction and electrocatalytic performance. Combined theoretical and  experimental studies are used in collaboration to verify the structure - activity connection at the atomic level and allows the PIs to determine how to design the surface structure and composition rationally to improve the catalysis performance.

Due to economic, cultural, and political pressures, languages with small speaker communities are disappearing rapidly throughout the world. Analyzing such languages helps linguists and linguistic anthropologists to understand the human capacity for language and to preserve invaluable cultural knowledge. Therefore, linguists seek to systematically document the structure and use of these highly vulnerable and valuable languages. Linguists also believe that it is important to understand how the languages are changing through their contact with politically dominant languages, a complex linguistic situation that emerges frequently as a result of immigration. For this project, the researchers will focus on a previously undocumented dialect of the Mixtec language of Mexico, working collaboratively with a local Mixtec organization that serves immigrants. The project will produce a dictionary, a grammar, and a collection of recorded language examples.  The project is innovative in its focus on indigenous immigration as a context for language change.  It will provide a model for other researchers seeking to gain insight into the workings of language as a fundamental human activity. Findings will also help develop community resources to support multilingualism and multiliteracy across generations.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken by linguists Dr. Eric W. Campbell and Dr. Mary Buholtz of the University of California in Santa Barbara. Many immigrants from Mexico speak Mixtec languages, which are entirely unrelated to Spanish and use tone to distinguish word meaning (as in Chinese). These speakers face multiple linguistic obstacles both in Mexico and in the United States. The project will bring together the scientific tools of language documentation, sociolinguistics, and linguistic anthropology to understand this complex linguistic situation. The project partner is a community organization that serves an indigenous immigrant community from Oaxaca, Mexico, now settled in Oxnard, California. The project has four interrelated goals: (1) to document the structure of local Mixtec languages by creating a grammatical description, a dictionary, and a collection of recorded speech; (2) to conduct a survey of the community status of Spanish, English, Mixtec, and other indigenous languages; (3) to document and analyze Spanish, English, and indigenous language and literacy practices through recordings of everyday interaction; and (4) to develop community multilingualism and multiliteracy resources. Participating graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students will receive training in anthropological and linguistic methods of data collection and analysis. The project advances language documentation and Mesoamerican linguistics by documenting and analyzing previously undescribed Mixtec languages. It also contributes to research on language contact. Moreover, the project advances linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics by investigating speakers' attitudes and practices regarding the maintenance or loss of home languages. Finally, the project helps open up a new field of linguistic study of a growing national and global phenomenon, the resettlement of indigenous language communities through immigration."

Indicators are being collected throughout the duration of the project in order to enable longitudinal analysis, for example, to measure any improvements that result from dissemination. It is also being investigated whether it is feasible to devise and deploy a prototype early-warning system that proactively alerts defenders quickly enough to arrest concentrated spikes in cybercriminal activity.

Instructional initiatives include improving existing curricula and publishing stand-alone resources that can be adopted by others.<br/><br/>The project is advancing understanding of how to construct reliable cybercrime indicators. Effort-based indicators help mitigate information asymmetries, so that anyone can see which defenders are working harder to clean up compromised resources. This could in turn improve the response to cybercrime overall by solving coordination problems in which individual defenders shirk responsibility. The project is also advancing understanding of how the response to cybercrime changes over time by collecting data for several years. If widely shared, the indicators can help incentivize defenders to fight cybercrime over the long term. The project seeks to identify not only how to construct the indicators, but also what is the most effective way to share them. The early-warning system, if successful, could greatly enhance the efficiency of countermeasures by helping defenders get ahead of the shifting tactics used by attackers. In the education program supported by the project, datasets are being added to curriculum modules that teach scientific approaches to cybersecurity.

These are questions that the strong and weak cosmic censorship conjectures in general relativity seek to address -- study of those conjectures is the central motivation for this project.<br/><br/>A particular focus of the project is to understand the singular boundary of the interior of black holes and also to understand sharp criteria under which trapped surfaces (structures closely related to black holes) may form. Recent work of the investigator and collaborators provides a resolution of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture for the Einstein-Maxwell (real) scalar field in spherical symmetry, showing that solutions arising from generic data have singular black hole interiors, in the sense that the spacetime metric cannot be extended in a suitably regular manner. This project aims to extend these results to settings without symmetry assumptions, in particular to give a complete description of the boundary of black holes that arise from perturbations of the explicit Kerr solutions. In a different direction, this project also aims to establish criteria that guarantee that trapped surfaces form, as a step towards understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in general relativity."

Successful implementation of the program goals holds potential for strengthening the social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the southeastern region of North Carolina and beyond.<br/><br/>The overall intent of PrOMiSS is to improve the forensic curriculum and research infrastructure at FSU. The specific goals are to enrich the forensic curriculum; strengthen forensic laboratories' infrastructure; increase passing rates in STEM courses; maintain specialized Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) accreditation; improve students' problem solving ability and critical thinking skills by involving them in STEM research; and improve students' attitude towards STEM education. In achieving its goals, PrOMiSS's impact will increase recruitment and retention, graduation rates, the number of underrepresented minority students in forensic disciplines and other STEM fields, and improve the preparation of students for graduate school. The project's greatest impact will be a reduction in the need for post-employment job training for new hires, while increasing the numbers of trained professionals who will contribute to national and global security."

Compared with inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, the molecular variety available for organic semiconductors, thanks to synthetic organic chemistry, offers near limitless potential. When combined with materials science, this rich molecular tapestry suggests availability of extraordinary control over optical and mechanical properties, materials cost, environmental impact, and simplicity of device construction. Efficient transfer of energy in the solid state is one of the fundamental aspects of both light-emitting and light harvesting devices. A better understanding of the relationship between molecular design and the transfer of energy in organic materials enables design of a broad range of more efficient next-generation optical and electronic devices. This research targets one of the energy transfer mechanisms that historically received less attention, a mechanism known as exchange. This mechanism is operative in all molecular systems, and a better understanding of how it contributes to energy transfer in the solid state will open the door to a broad range of new, and more efficient organic electronics. This project includes introducing thousands of third through sixth grade students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds to the fundamental concept of energy and the basic idea of pursuing a college education in a STEM field.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The first step in exciton transport is inter-chromophore energy transfer. Historically, simplicity has promoted binary association of emissive materials with an inductive transfer mechanism and non-emissive materials with an exchange mechanism. This distinction has not always been consistent with observation. This research is developing a better understanding of the role of each mechanism. Experimental accessibility has focused previous attention on luminescent systems. Realizing that the high molecular density inherent to devices facilitates exchange, and acknowledging that exchange does not have the same limitations as induction, this work is filling gaps in the understanding of transport in non-luminescent materials. At the same time, this work is elucidating the combined roles of both mechanisms. Employing methodologies to probe exciton diffusion in both luminescent and non-luminescent materials, this work is elucidating ways to exploit combined approaches to transport, quantifying parasitic exciton quenching via annihilation and polaron trapping, and measuring the effects of exciton fission on energy transport. Taken in aggregate, this research is providing a significant contribution to the understanding of exciton transport in organic semiconductors and developing design principles to enhance the next generation of light harvesting and light-emitting devices. The project is simultaneously training multiple graduate students in a wide range of state-of-the-art physical and materials science theory and experimental techniques."

In particular, research focuses on deformation by twinning, besides dislocation mediated deformation one of the major modes of plastic deformation. While the dynamical properties of dislocations have been well studied, a corresponding knowledge for twin boundaries does not exist though it is highly needed for the advancement of modern materials including high strength structural materials, nanocrystalline materials, nanoscale materials, and functional materials to align with the Materials Genome Initiative. The international team aims to correlate the dynamical properties of twin boundaries (TBs) to their atomistic structure, which includes topological defects such as twinning disconnections (TDs). Researchers will use novel experimental and analytical models to: (1) characterize twin boundary structures, (2) establish twin boundary defect models for type I and type II twins, (3) measure the complete kinetic relation of twin boundary motion, (4) develop analytical models for twin boundary motion, and (5) formulate relations between structural properties of twin boundaries and the dynamics of the twinning process. This research program proposes to advance knowledge in materials science and physics through a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of the relationships between the atomistic structures of TBs and TDs; barriers and mechanisms for TB and TD motion; and kinetic relations for TB motion. The team will study these topics in three different martensite structures and three different types of twins (compound, type I and type II). Results are expected to facilitate accurate models of the complicated structures of TBs of type I and II twins, and the kinetic relations of the TBs. Results will be significant as they will apply to all materials that deform by twinning including intermetallic compounds, ferroelectric ceramics, shape memory alloys, and metals. Both US and Israeli PIs have complementary research projects on related subjects that will benefit from project results. Specifically, the American PI is conducting twinning and fatigue research including NSF-funded work. The Israeli PI has an ISF project on twinning dynamics in ferroic materials, which has one year of overlap with the proposed program. The experienced international team has the required know how and resources to carry out the proposed work."

For example, consider a person learning how their daily routines influence their productivity at work, or learning how their style of interacting with their child influences their child's behavior, or whether exercise improves their mood. These examples involve a person collecting a set of experiences and drawing a conclusion about the causal influence of their choices, which requires sophisticated memory and reasoning abilities. The overall scientific objective of this research is to understand how individuals remember their experiences and come to accurate conclusions about causal influence (e.g., whether exercise improves an individual person's mood). If individuals' conclusions are fairly inaccurate, it would imply that they should be wary of making important decisions in their lives merely from memory. Causal reasoning is also important in science literacy. For this reason, the overall educational objective of this project is to create online tutorials for college students to teach them how to interpret and design research studies so that they learn to value scientific research for making decisions in their own lives.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of understanding whether individuals can accurately learn from their memories of prior experiences will be tested in a series of experiments implemented via smartphone that last 20 days. Each day participants will receive information on their smartphone pertaining to two events (e.g., hypothetically whether they exercised, and whether their mood is good or bad). At the end of the 20 days, they will make a judgment about whether one event has a causal influence on the other. The accuracy of participants' judgments and their memories for the 20 days will be assessed, as well as the relationships between the judgments, long-term memories, and working memory capacity. Though experiments on causal inference have been conducted in the past, they have primarily been conducted over a couple minutes, rather than across 20 days, limiting the ability to understand how people engage in causal reasoning in their own lives across long timespans. The educational objective of teaching college students how to interpret and design research studies will be achieved through a series of publically-available online interactive tutorials. Students will learn how to discriminate between science and pseudoscience, to identify mischaracterized and hyperbolic scientific claims, to accurately infer causal relations in their own lives, and to design research studies that optimize the ability to infer causal relations."

Unfortunately, as the dimensions of ferroelectric materials decrease to a few tens of nanometers, their high dielectric property eventually disappears as a result of destabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop novel, high dielectric constant ferroelectric nanocrystals with stable ferroelectric phase and nanosized domains.

The nanoscale ferroelectric phase and domain structures in polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals are interrogated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the mechanism of their relaxor ferroelectric behavior can be unraveled.

The research team aims to understand how such weak interlayer interactions modify the properties of artificial van der Waals heterostructures and explores how these modifications can be utilized for designing materials with desirable properties. In this project, van der Waals heterostructures are synthesized by direct growth of layered materials on van der Waals substrates. The variation of their electronic properties due to interlayer interactions are characterized by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Scanning probe techniques also allow the characterization of artificially grown nanostructures and lateral interfaces. Quantum critical phenomena, such as charge density wave transitions, are anticipated to be sensitively dependent on interlayer interactions and thus the tuning of transition temperatures is being studied in metallic materials. Band gap tuning as a function of layers and/or interfaces with dissimilar materials are being studied in semiconducting materials. Finally, modifications of single layer electronic properties by molecular adsorption, charge transfer doping, or field effect is explored by combining the capabilities of growing single layers with a new nanoprobe transport measurement under ultra-high vacuum conditions."

These waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and were first predicted by Einstein a century ago. The waves that LIGO detected were the result of a cataclysmic collision of two black holes, each 30 times more massive than our own Sun, crashing into each other at half the speed of light. This detection of gravitational waves has opened up an entirely new way for us to explore our Universe. We will learn about the very first stars in the Universe, how elements such as gold were made in the Universe, and we will also test Einstein's theory of gravity (a fundamental pillar of physics). This project is to help develop this entirely new field of gravitational-wave astrophysics, and to explore what LIGO will teach us about astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The first major theme of this project is LIGO Astrophysics. In the near future interesting LIGO constraints will arise from statistical analyses rather than individual events. For example, we can anticipate three general astrophysical quantities of interest: 1. the rate of mergers of compact binary systems, 2. the mass and mass ratio distributions of these mergers, and 3. the spin distributions of the component systems. The PI will help produce these distributions and the attendant science. This work is at the heart of the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. In addition to this core work, the PI will engage in a number of related projects, including the modeling of spins in hierarchical formation channels, the use of Gaussian Process Emulators to model waveforms from compact binary coalescence, the role of systematic errors in LIGO astrophysics, and LIGO's ability to constrain electromagnetically charged black holes. The second major theme of the project is Multi-Messenger Astronomy, which focuses on the next gravitational-wave revolution: identifying electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave sources. This will shed light on the underlying astrophysical processes and elucidate the formation channels of these gravitational-wave events. In addition, multi-messenger astronomy offers the potential to use gravitational-wave sources as standard candles to constrain cosmology. The PI plans the development of tools and pipelines to hasten the arrival of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy, including facilitating electromagnetic follow-up efforts through the continuing refinement and implementation of low-latency 3D localization algorithms and the optimization of follow-up resource allocation.

Bacterial species form complex communities composed of many different functional types, and which types are present and how they behave and interact affects the overall functions produced by the ecosystem. Disturbances in ecosystems caused by things like antibiotic treatments, fertilizer runoff, or invasion by non-native species, can change the species composition of bacterial communities. Even if many of the same bacterial species remain after a disturbance, the functions they provide can be altered by the disturbance, and result in a large impact on the entire ecosystem. This project will examine how lake bacterial communities respond to a widespread disturbance impacting many waterbodies in North American - invasion by zebra and quagga mussels. These non-native mussel species have spread to lakes and rivers in over 30 US states and have had major impacts on the food webs and fisheries. Results from this project will help us understand how the ecosystem effects of these mussels is manifest through their impact on the bacterial communities. The results will help us predict how other types of disturbance will change the ecosystem services provided by the bacteria. The project will also integrate incoming undergraduate students interested in science and technology fields through an intensive summer program focused on increasing retention and diversity in science and technology majors.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to study the responses of bacterial communities to short and medium term biological disturbance, in order to separate the roles of bacterial physiological responses caused by phenotypic plasticity from ecological responses mediated by shifts in bacterial community composition. This work will explore effects of dreissenid mussel invasion in freshwater lakes on resident bacterial communities, and will employ a combination of laboratory and field experiments. The project relies on a recently developed method based on flow cytometric analysis of bacterial diversity that, when combined with sequencing based analyses, will allow the researchers to distinguish phenotypic from genotypic responses of bacterial communities. It holds promise to establish direct connections between high-throughput measurements of in situ plasticity of microbial phenotypic traits and the underlying molecular mechanism (changes in gene expression).

In contrast to conventional metals, which are crystalline, the atomic arrangements in metallic glasses exhibit significant disorder. The high strength and elasticity of metallic glasses make them attractive for applications in medical and other mechanical devices, as well as sporting goods. However, they exhibit limited ductility and toughness, which can lead to catastrophic fracture. In crystalline materials, heat and deformation treatment are routinely used for property improvement, and the associated mechanisms have been understood for many years. A parallel understanding of the atomic-scale rearrangements in metallic glasses is a scientific challenge, since the baseline arrangements are not known. However, such an understanding is crucial to improving their properties. A recently developed method of characterizing  small atomic clusters  called shear transformation zones (STZs), undergo shape change as a result of deformation in a metallic glass, is used in this research. Analysis of time-dependent shape recovery reveals distinct signatures of STZs, resolved by the number of atoms they comprise. Critical experiments will be performed to explain previous experimental observations. The STZ dynamics will be compared between similar alloys that differ in their ductility. Atom-probe tomography, a method that can yield atomic-scale composition mapping, will be used to determine the role of potentially heterogeneous chemical composition, and its correlation with the STZ population. The expected results include realistic input into simulations of macroscopic behavior. The insights gained will help interpret a range of past experimental results, and assist future development of ductile alloys. The proposed work will promote the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will learn materials fundamentals, develop the ability to plan and conduct experiments and modeling, and learn to communicate their results.

However, flow localization often leads to catastrophic failure at a shear band. As in crystalline materials, thermo-mechanical treatment can improve their properties. In contrast to crystalline materials, an atomic level understanding of mechanical properties of metallic glasses and their response to thermo-mechanical treatment is still lacking. Plastic deformation of metallic glasses is accommodated by thermally activated shear of atomic clusters, known as shear transformation zones (STZs). Because there is no known mechanism for imaging STZs, their microscopic properties had been studied mostly in physical analogues and numerical models, which cover a limited dynamic range of time. Recently, the anelastic relaxation kinetics of different metallic glasses have been measured.  These measurements reveal an atomically quantized hierarchy of STZs, resolved by the number of atoms they comprise. The shape of the size-density distributions of potential STZs, obtained from the spectra, varies significantly with the alloy. The proposed work is aimed at gaining an atomic scale understanding of how the size distribution of potential STZs a) correlates with ductility, stored enthalpy and chemical heterogeneity; b) varies between conventional metallic glasses and those with intense high-frequency (beta) mechanical relaxations, which have been shown to be ductile; c) is affected by thermomechanical treatment, including thermal cycling, cyclic and elastostatic deformation. Using a combination of quasi-static and cyclic experiments, more than eight orders of magnitude in relaxation time will be covered. Relaxation-time spectra will be computed from the data. The stored enthalpy will be determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Atom-probe tomography (APT) will be used to identify deviations from random elemental distributions, including size distributions of clusters enriched in an alloying element. Correlating the APT results with the size distribution of potential STZs will elucidate the role of local chemistry in shear transformations. Experimental input will be provided for mesoscopic simulations of macroscopic behavior. The proposed work will enhance the atomic-scale understanding of processing and deformation of metallic glasses, bringing the community's understanding of metallic glass properties closer to that for crystalline metals. The results will assist the future development of ductile alloys, thus impacting future technology. Graduate and undergraduate students will a) learn materials fundamentals; b) develop the ability to plan and conduct combined experiments and modeling, and to communicate their results.

The core idea of the Langlands phenomenon is that some basic symmetry laws that arise naturally in mathematics come in pairs, known as Langlands dual pairs. It has been observed empirically that mathematical constructions that obey one set of symmetry laws are equivalent to fundamentally different constructions for the dual symmetry laws. The goals of this project are to formalize and make mathematically rigorous the underlying structures responsible for this duality in the case of the geometric Langlands correspondence.<br/><br/>In more detail, it has become clear that in order to understand the  geometric Langlands correspondence, one should perform a quantum deformation, in which case the roles of the group and its Langlands dual become more symmetric, that is, there is no more ""automorphic vs. Galois"", but rather ""twisted automorphic vs. twisted automorphic."" After performing the quantum deformation, one sees that at the origin of the geometric Langlands correspondence should be a certain equivalence of local categories, proposed by J. Lurie and the PI several years ago: this is the equivalence of the Whittaker category (for a group G) vs the Kazhdan-Luztig category (for the Langlands dual of G).  This project will establish this equivalence and develop its consequences."

This project concerns a powerful technique, called deformation-rigidity theory, to study these opposing phenomena in the framework of von Neumann algebras, i.e., algebras of infinite matrices, where the product of two elements, A times B, may be different from the product in reverse order, B times A, a fact that reflects the laws of quantum mechanics in particle physics (Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle). Von Neumann algebras are also related to group theory and ergodic theory, since transformations of spaces give rise to a special class of such algebras called II1 factors. Rigidity in this context occurs when the group of transformations can be recognized by merely knowing its associated II1 factor (which is a very coarse object). The study of rigidity of factors is an interdisciplinary endeavor and can be relevant to many areas of mathematics. It also has applications to computer science, complexity theory, design computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes. This research project aims to deepen understanding in this important area.<br/><br/>The principal investigator recently added several new tools to this study, namely an approximation/simulation technique, a representation theory, and a cohomology. In this project, he intends to combine all these tools to further study rigidity-versus-randomness phenomena in II1 factors and to tackle several famous problems in this area: the Connes Approximate Embedding (CAE) conjecture, the sofic group problem, the free group factor problem, the paving problem, and calculations of invariants for group-like objects. It should be noted that the CAE conjecture, which predicts that II1 factors can be ""simulated"" on a computer, would have striking consequences in quantum information theory."

Within 40 years the key principles of Set Theory were discovered, these are the ZFC axioms, and the stage was set for the detailed development of transfinite mathematics, or so it seemed. However, in a completely unexpected development, Cohen showed in 1963 that even the most basic problem of Set Theory was not solvable on the basis of these principles alone. That problem was the widely discussed and celebrated problem of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. The 50 years since Cohen's announcement has seen a vast development of Cohen's method and to the realization that the occurrence of unsolvable problems is ubiquitous in Set Theory. This arguably challenges the very conception of Cantor on which Set Theory is based. However, during this same period, the detailed study of special cases of the Continuum Hypothesis led to a remarkable success. This was the discovery and validation of a key new principle for Second Order Number Theory. Second Order Number Theory is the study of the structure of all sets of counting numbers, and this is just Set Theory in its simplest incarnation. The resulting theory is largely immune to Cohen's method. The prospect that this could somehow be extended to produce an analogous new principle for Set Theory itself (as a single additional axiom to the ZFC axioms) has always seemed completely hopeless. But that belief was itself based on a misconception and recent discoveries suggest there is a resolution. These discoveries were the result of prior NSF supported research. This project continues and expands the research based on these discoveries.<br/><br/>Gödel's consistency proof for the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis involves his discovery of the Constructible Universe of Sets. The axiom ""V = L"" is the axiom which asserts that every set is constructible. This axiom settles the Continuum Hypothesis and more importantly,  Cohen's method of forcing  cannot be used in the context of the axiom ""V = L"". However the axiom V = L is  false since it limits the fundamental nature of infinity. In particular the axiom refutes (most) strong axioms of infinity. A key question emerges. Is there an ""ultimate"" version of Gödel's constructible universe L yielding an axiom ""V = Ultimate L"" which retains the power of the axiom ""V = L""  for resolving questions like that of the Continuum Hypothesis, which is also immune against Cohen's method of forcing, and yet which does not refute strong axioms of infinity? This vague question has been recast, through previously supported research,  into a specific and precise conjecture; the Ultimate L Conjecture. The goal of this project is to resolve that conjecture."

Roughly speaking, microlocal analysis devises methods to keep track of the position and frequency (or momentum) of waves (or, more generally, functions) simultaneously. The project's applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as to inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (the X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the project itself concerns their mathematical theory, the problems under investigation are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples. The theory of general relativity is another important physical example via (the recently detected) gravitational waves. Scattering theory for quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis, aspects of which enter into the description of both quantum waves at large distances and semiclassical phenomena (those in which Planck's constant can be regarded as small, often the case in chemistry). The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance. One application of the theory under development here is the determination of an unknown variable sound speed in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves.<br/><br/>Parts of this project describe the long-time or far-field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in scattering theory and general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in work on linear and nonlinear problems on asymptotically (real) hyperbolic spaces as well as on Kerr-de Sitter space. The projects here aim to improve the understanding of Lorentzian scattering spaces, which include asymptotically Minkowski spaces (asymptotically flat spaces, which our universe approximates, at least locally, even if there is a small positive cosmological constant). Other projects concern the behavior of waves at edges -- specifically, the diffraction of the Rayleigh (surface) waves of elasticity. Yet another main area is inverse problems, building on recently-developed tools for spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, including the solution of fixed conformal class boundary rigidity: under suitable assumptions, one can determine a variable sound speed inside an object from the travel times of waves between points on the surface. The parts of the project in this area aim to extend the foregoing result to tensors, which describe anisotropic sound speeds in an appropriate sense; namely, the project will investigate boundary rigidity, for example, recovering a Riemannian metric from its boundary distance function."

Thermoelectric materials can convert a heat gradient into electricity. The design of efficient thermoelectric devices is a major goal for energy conversion technologies. Zintl phases, which are a subset of intermetallics are ideal candidates for thermoelectric applications as they are semiconductors with complex structures which provide low thermal conductivity, which allows for precise tuning of carrier concentration.

The settings for these problems involve objects known as geometric manifolds of dimension two or greater.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called its eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher-dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and the principal investigator wishes to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the project will also study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity.<br/><br/>Among the specific problems the principal investigator will study, he seeks to obtain improved estimates that measure the size and concentration of eigenfunctions.  In order to do this he will develop what he calls ""global harmonic analysis,"" which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis, and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates that one has in mind are estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and related highly localized estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  The main questions center around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affect the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much-studied (but still not well-understood) questions of concentration, oscillation, and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.  The principal investigator is also interested in understanding the harmonic analysis and spectral theory of operators that arise from boundary traces."

The Constitution, however, does not allow the president to introduce legislation directly to Congress. Presidents do, however, use public appeals and private communications to request new legislation from Congress. Unlike their parliamentary executive counterparts, presidents must frequently work to change or to prevent the enactment of unattractive legislation. Most of what the public and scholars learn about presidents' legislative efforts come from their public statements. Presidents' public appeals, however, constitute only a part of their dealings with Congress on legislative business. Presidents engage in a myriad of other, less visible activities to advance their legislative goals. Many are informal, private, and unrecorded, while others enlist more formal mechanisms of communication that generate paper and electronic records. This research exploits the recent acquisition of records for two such formal communication mechanisms obtained from the files of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). First, OMB logs administration request for legislation to individual members and committees and tracks the legislative history of these proposals. Second, OMB drafts and distributes presidents' Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) to congressional leaders. SAPs are formal statements in which presidents and their agents endorse, oppose and/or sometimes threaten to veto pieces of pending legislation. The researcher has compiled a complete set of the records for SAPs from 1985 to the present, and from 1979 to 2007 for the OMB logs.  For the first time, students of presidential-congressional relations have detailed information on these key direct efforts to influence legislation on the part of the president. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project will investigate to what extent presidential requests serve to set Congress' agenda. The work aims to identify both structural and personal conditions that help explain the observed variation in presidential effectiveness.  In doing so, the research will provide better metrics of the ideological content of presidents' legislative preferences vis-à-vis Congress, and how this ideological positioning influences their capacity to lead their co-partisans in Congress. In other words, the project investigates whether legislators respond to signals from the president, and if so, do these signals affect the content of the agenda Congress pursues.  This work will provide insight into these fundamental questions related to the US separation of powers systems and how it affects both presidents and legislators during periods of unified and divided party control of government.  To evaluate these points, the investigator will compile and analyze a data base consisting of presidents' legislative initiatives and positions on pending floor votes comprised of two specific pieces of information compiled by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): 1) logs of administration requests for legislation sent to individual members, and 2) Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs).  The PI will compile a data set of OMB logs from 1979 to 2007 and of SAPs from 1985 to the present.  These new data offer superior information for testing these and other under-explored questions related to presidential influence and executive-legislative relations."

The project will enhance the research capabilities of the PI as well as teaching and learning at HSSU where approximately 90% of the undergraduate students are African Americans. Undergraduate students will benefit from the research experiences and training opportunities provided by the project activities. The project has the potential to increase the number of African Americans engaged in research and support the nation's efforts in building a robust STEM workforce. <br/>	<br/>The goal of the proposed study is to understand the basic underpinnings of Midline (Mid) function as a cell-fate determinant, pattern generator, and newly identified anti-apoptotic factor within developing Drosophila eye tissues using a combination of genetic, molecular biological, bioinformatics and biochemical approaches. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine whether the mid gene patterns the developing retina by using genetic and immunolabeling approaches to examine the expression level and pattern of specific morphogens in developing wild-type, mid loss-of-function (LOF) and mid-gain-of-function (GOF) eye imaginal discs; 2) resolve the mechanisms by which mid or the Mid protein collaborates with Notch-Delta pathway members to pattern the retina and to specify sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell fates utilizing genetic, molecular biological and biochemical approaches; and 3) identify mid-regulated gene expression specific to Notch and apoptotic signaling pathways within early-staged pupal eye imaginal discs using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Differential Expression for RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and microRNA-Seq methodologies. The successful completion of the proposed goals will contribute to the field of T-box and eye developmental research."

Such sharp effects are typically experienced when a system is subjected to a sudden shock (e.g., the effect of political tension on stock prices, the effect of socio-political upheaval on social-media networks, or the effect of a medical intervention on disease progression). Such sharp changes are of critical interest to practitioners in these different fields as they typically have important implications for future decision-making. Statisticians model such sharp changes in time, for example, through what are called ""change-points;"" when the sharp change happens due to the effect of multiple variables simultaneously, such regions are described in terms of ""change-planes."" This project aims to develop novel methods of identifying such change-points or change-planes in problems where massive amounts of data -- which have now become the norm given advances in storage capabilities as well as collection mechanisms -- are available, and furthermore, the number of variables on which data are recorded is also very large. The performance of such methods will be carefully analyzed using mathematical theory as well as computer-generated simulations, and the methods will also be validated on real data coming from a variety of sources. It is anticipated that the results of the research will have impact in a variety of natural science as well as social science disciplines. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of this project is to develop methodology and inference in a class of problems in which thresholds or boundaries (in one or multiple dimensions) that induce discontinuities arise naturally, either in the statistical model or in the estimation paradigm. The problems are studied both in the setting of massive amounts of data as well as in scenarios where the number of covariates can exceed the number of observations. The boundaries considered in one-dimension are change-points, while those in multiple dimensions are hyper-planes. The studied problems present two different kinds of complexities: (a) massive amounts of available data, and/or (b) large numbers of covariates relative to number of observations. In particular: (i) A number of ideas are developed for sampling intelligently from (retrospectively observed) long time-series to determine the locations of multiple change-points via procedures that require analyzing only a vanishing fraction of the entire series (thereby providing computational benefits), yet produce estimates that match, in precision, the standard estimates that would have been obtained analyzing the entire series. This idea is extended to regression/likelihood based models with covariates in multiple dimensions where the parameters of the regression or the likelihood are different on either side of a hyper-plane in covariate space. (ii) Problems involving hyper-planes, either in the structure of the model or in the criterion function to be optimized, with high-dimensional covariates are studied and new variable selection and estimation methods are investigated. The problems under consideration here are important from the perspective of applications but difficult because the high-dimensional paradigm has to be extended to intrinsically discontinuous settings, outside the (almost) square-root-n rate. Effective solutions to these problems will advance statistical methodology for these important classes of systems."

Development of efficient and accurate numerical algorithms for simulation of solutions to conservation laws continues to be a challenging task. Structure-preserving methods, which provide numerical solutions that preserve a certain continuum property of the underlying models exactly, are recently demonstrated to be more efficient with limited computational resources. This project aims to develop a comprehensive framework to understand structure-preserving methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The work will have a direct impact in many multi-disciplinary application areas, including fluid and gas dynamics, astrophysics, and atmospheric modeling. This project also has significant broader impact through various educational and outreach activities aimed at students at all levels. These activities include a summer camp program that will expose students including underrepresented minorities to the areas of mathematical modeling, computational science, and computational mathematics. Graduate students will also be mentored and trained through planned working group activities. <br/><br/>The notion of conservation (of number, mass, energy, momentum) is a fundamental principle that is used to derive hyperbolic conservation laws. Recent study reveals that structure-preserving numerical methods, which either conserve important physical quantities in addition to mass or preserve other properties of the underlying physical problems, are demonstrated to be more accurate and often have a much improved long time behavior. The objective of this project is to establish a detailed study of novel high-order structure-preserving methods for the linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws arising in various applications, and to educate students at various levels about the potential and challenges of utilizing numerical simulation to solve important practical problems. The PI aims to study structure-preserving numerical methods in the following directions: (i) Energy conserving methods for wave equations; (ii) Asymptotic preserving methods for kinetic equations; (iii) Well-balanced methods for hyperbolic problems with source terms. The activity is planned to include new algorithm development, theoretical numerical analysis, numerical implementation, and practical applications. This project will also provide excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students interested in computational sciences, and includes an outreach program for high school students."

The event will take place in conjunction with the 19th ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) and the 21st ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC), to be collocated in Maui, Hawaii on September 11-15, and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery.  The ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the premier interdisciplinary venue in which leading international researchers, designers, developers, and practitioners in the field present and discuss novel results in all aspects of ubiquitous and pervasive computing.  This includes the design, development, and deployment of ubiquitous and pervasive computing technologies and the understanding of human experiences and social impacts that these technologies facilitate.  Relevant research topics include, but are not limited to, systems and infrastructures, devices and techniques, applications and experiences, methodologies and tools, and theories and models.  More information about the conference may be found at http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2017/.  ISWC is a conference dedicated to cutting-edge research in wearable technologies, and is the premier forum for wearable computing and issues related to on-body and worn mobile technologies.  Every year, ISWC brings together researchers, product vendors, fashion designers, textile manufacturers, users, and related professionals to share information and advances in wearable computing.  The conference typically includes dedicated workshops, a juried design competition, a lively gadget show, and high-quality paper presentation sessions revealing the latest in wearable computing progress.  More information about this conference may be found at http://www.iswc.net/iswc17/.  The joint ISWC/UbiComp Doctoral Colloquium will help expand the participation of young researchers pursuing graduate studies in the various fields associated with ubiquitous computing, by affording them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community.  It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Many participants in past UbiComp doctoral consortia have since gone on to high profile research careers.  The event organizers are committed to achieving diversity among the student participants, including in terms of gender and ethnicity.  To further support diversity, no more than 2 students will be accepted from any one institution.<br/><br/>The goals of the joint ISWC/UbiComp Doctoral Colloquium are: to provide a forum that will allow senior-level doctoral students to attend the ISWC/UbiComp conferences and take part as contributors to the program, as well as encourage further participation in the future; to give emerging ISWC and UbiComp researchers the opportunity to present their work and receive feedback, guidance, and encouragement from respected researchers to whom they may not have ready access at their home institutions; to provide opportunities for discussion among senior-level doctoral students to expose them to new perspectives on their field and in closely related fields; to foster the building of research relationships that will continue to benefit the students as they progress in their careers; and to expose the diversity and depth of research in the field as being undertaken by junior researchers to the greater UbiComp/ISWC community.  To these ends, the format of the doctoral colloquium will facilitate the open exchange of ideas and in-depth discussion among members of the next generation of wearable and ubiquitous computing researchers and established top researchers in the area.  The colloquium will begin with a joint session in which all participants will present a 1-minute version of their research.

Thus, for economic reasons, it is critical to use these resources as efficiently as possible. Increasing a power plant's operating temperature increases its efficiency. The limiting factor for higher temperature is materials that can operate at higher temperatures, and are economically viable. The aim of this project is to elucidate the deformation mechanisms in alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) stainless steels that are being considered for this application. The work will train both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in state of the art techniques.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project will ascertain the deformation mechanisms associated with grain boundary (GB) precipitation strengthening, and attempt to understand the fundamental deformation behavior in alloys containing both a precipitate free zone (PFZ) and multiple types of precipitates in both the GBs and the matrix each of which can contribute differently to the deformation behavior. The work will be performed on the model AFA stainless steel Fe-20Cr-30Ni-2Nb-5Al. Detailed microstructural and defect characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) wlll be performed before and after mechanical testing. TEM in-situ straining and SEM in-situ straining studies performed at both room temperature and 750C will examine both dislocation/precipitate and dislocation/GB interactions, including understanding the role of the PFZ along the GBs.

The calcar is a 'neomorphism,'it suddenly appears in the earliest bats but is not found in their ancestors: its appearance in the fossil record is difficult to explain. The bat calcar is particularly exceptional because it varies extensively across bat species, suggesting that anatomical variation may have functional and ecological implications. Therefore, the calcar offers a unique model system for studying the processes that generate anatomical novelty and diversity in vertebrates. In this project, the researchers will link approaches from developmental biology and biomechanics in order to explain the evolution of the calcar and to explore its functional relevance across the global radiation of bats. The researchers will also create education and outreach activities that will promote the utility of interdisciplinary research for solving enduring questions in biology.<br/><br/>The researchers' primary goal is to use the calcar of bats (Chiroptera) to understand how developmental modifications can lead to the formation of novel skeletal structures and to functionally-relevant variability in those structures. The specific objectives of this project are to 1) reveal the developmental origin of the calcar and discern its homology among bats, and 2) identify developmental processes that lead to differences in connective tissue composition among calcars (i.e., why some calcars calcify or ossify while others do not). These objectives will be addressed using histochemical and immunofluorescent assays of bat embryos representing phylogenetically, morphologically, and ecologically diverse species. These experiments will expand on the researchers' recent work on calcar functional anatomy and biomechanics. This project will strengthen the ability of the researchers to test their overarching hypothesis: the evolution of the calcar resulted from modifications in developmental regulation of chondrogenesis and ossification leading to adaptive evolution."

Often these equations are algebraic in nature, such as those describing lines, circles, and parabolas. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions -- think about the equation defining a circle -- and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. One part of this research project addresses questions that have emerged in this endeavor. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to a mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a variety to a group, and in the past few years various researchers, including the investigator, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.<br/><br/>This research is rooted in commutative algebra, with applications also to the representation theory of finite group schemes in positive characteristic. The first part of the project concerns the homological aspects of modules over commutative rings. The problems posed range from those that have arisen from the internal developments in the subject to ones inspired by recent advances in the broader mathematical context, notably the representation theory of algebras and homotopy theory. The focus in the second part of the project is on the Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebras. Classically, Hochschild cohomology has been of interest for it is one of two main cohomology theories that capture properties of the diagonal morphism. A different aspect of Hochschild cohomology has begun to play an increasingly important role: Its action on derived categories, and various triangulated categories. The problems proposed in the second part of the project address both aspects. In recent years, notions and techniques from commutative ring theory have proved to be remarkably effective in solving problems in, and shedding new light on, the representation theory of finite groups over a field of positive characteristic. This project will develop these connections in new directions."

Compared to portland cement concrete, geopolymers are more durable and less energy- and resource-intensive to manufacture due to their use of waste by-product materials.

Using a nondestructive microwave technique coupled with materials characterization methods, geopolymer reaction mechanisms can be studied and modeled, especially those involving water. The outcomes of the project will provide material design tools for geopolymers to become a staple material used to build the nation?s future sustainable structures. This research will also improve the prediction of strength, durability, and early-age properties of current structural materials such as portland cement concrete and advance other future materials with similar compositions. Further, the microwave-based assessment technique evolved from this project will enable in-situ evaluation of materials that undergo a hardening reaction after placement in the field thereby offering structural health monitoring and enhancing the construction quality control.

Microwave techniques will be used to discern changes in material properties through dielectric measurements. Dielectric mixing models will be corroborated with multi-scale materials characterization techniques to quantify changes in water binding and corresponding phase composition transformations in geopolymers. This multi-physics approach will culminate in two new material models. The first model will link the phase formation mechanisms that occur during geopolymerization reaction with setting, rheological, and mechanical behavior. The second model will extend Powers Model for cement hydration to alkali-activated materials. Such a model will allow materials engineers to optimize geopolymer microstructures based on composition and curing inputs. These models can be extended for other materials with calcium-silicate chemistries and variable water binding. This work will also lay the groundwork for in-situ test methods suitable for assessment of geopolymer maturity, thereby offering structural health monitoring and improved quality control."

Understanding of the mechanism of grain growth and the evolution of defect structures during the annealing process is therefore a subject that is of fundamental relevance to both the science and engineering of BCP-based materials. The objective of this project is to elucidate the role of filler-matrix interactions on grain coarsening in miscible BCP/homopolymer blends and to test the hypothesis that grain boundary complexion transitions -- i.e. transitions within the phase of filler that is segregated to grain boundary interfaces -- increase the driving pressure for grain growth and hence the rate of grain coarsening. In a first part, the program will be focused on establishing the miscibility range and (equilibrium) microdomain formation in BCP/homopolymer blends systems in which the homopolymer forms a LCST blend with the host copolymer domain. In a second part, the project will focus on establishing the effect of filler/matrix interactions on the energy of grain boundary interfaces in quiescent organized films. If successful, this project will provide a basis for the development of novel processing strategies towards low defect-density BCP materials that harness the 'catalytic' effect of designed filler additives on grain coarsening to efficiently organize BCPs into desired large-grained microstructures. The program will enhance the teaching of a new class on ""Soft Material Microstructure and Properties"" and provide training for one graduate and several undergraduate researchers in the critical area of polymer and nanoscale materials. Finally, the benefits of kinesthetic experiments to the teaching of polymer and material science will be evaluated."

Past research in a wide range of fields often has reported considerable cross-site heterogeneity in the average program effect. However, program evaluators have not been able to take full advantage of multi-site data. The analytic strategies to be developed in this project will be suitable for testing scientific theories about the intermediate process of an intervention and for assessing whether and how the program mechanism operates differently across settings. The new strategies will allow applied researchers to flexibly ask a new set of empirical questions crucial for testing the generalizability of an intervention theory across settings and for unpacking complex mediation mechanisms, making it possible to revisit the intervention theory and to suggest specific site-level modifications of the intervention practice. This project is motivated by application examples, including the National Job Corps Study, which evaluates a program designed to promote economic independence of disadvantaged youths; the Head Start Impact Study, which evaluates the federal early childhood education program for children living in poverty; and math curricular reforms in Chicago Public Schools aimed at improving the math learning of low-achieving ninth graders. The research team will provide open-source R packages and Stata ado files along with user manuals and pedagogical data examples for dissemination.<br/><br/>This research is built on the tradition of mediation analysis in the social sciences and on the recent developments in statistical theories and methods for causal mediation analysis. The existing methods, in general, require the analyst to specify both mediator models and outcome models involving comparatively strong model-based assumptions. Assessing between-site heterogeneity in causal mechanisms is challenging especially when many of the model-based assumptions are impractical. The research team has made initial attempts to extend a propensity score-based weighting method to multisite analysis of simple mediation mechanisms. This weighting method does not require outcome model specifications. The latest analytic procedure, however, is limited to experiments with a relatively large sample size per site. To overcome the existing challenges, this project will advance methodological developments in causal parameter estimation, propensity score estimation, and sensitivity analysis. The investigators will develop a novel pseudo-outcome random-effects strategy for causal parameter estimation analyzed through method-of-moments to avoid model-based assumptions. By pooling data from all the sites, the analysis will be unconstrained by a small sample size per site and will be flexible for investigating complex mediation mechanisms. Asymptotic variances will be obtained that take into account uncertainty in propensity score estimation. For enhancing robustness to propensity score model misspecification, a covariate-balancing propensity score estimation approach will be incorporated. The investigators also will develop a new weighting-based approach to sensitivity analysis for omitted post-treatment as well as pre-treatment confounders. These new strategies will be extended from simple to complex mechanisms and from experimental to quasi-experimental multi-site data."

Passive-solar-design seeks to balance heat loss through the building envelope with solar energy input, while also using thermal mass, shading, and/or ventilation to dampen daily thermal swings. However, implementation of current passive-solar-design tends to be highly context-specific and often entails use of costly mechanical devices and controls.  This project aims to study an innovative passive solar building enclosure system that uses cellular solid-solid phase change materials (SS-PCM) with variable transparency. The system relies on passive material-enabled controls and has no mechanically moving parts or electrical components. Successful implementation of SS-PCM foam-based building envelope materials can result in low cost responsive building enclosure systems that self-regulate building thermal comfort. The outcome of this study can lead to new technologies that reduce energy use in buildings, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and improve the economic competitiveness of the United States. This study is also expected to result in benefits to diverse industries such as building materials, construction, and energy conservation. An innovative outreach plan will be implemented in the form of a competition that engages students at various levels of education in the topics of passive solar design, energy use, and thermal comfort in buildings.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to uncover the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of translucent cellular SS-PCM systems used in realistic building envelopes. Fundamental insights will be gained on (1) heat transfer phenomena occurring in SS-PCM foam systems, (2) the synergistic effects occurring between three material-enabled solar-light irradiation control mechanisms, and (3) structural features and characteristics that lead to high energy-savings in buildings. This study will create enabling knowledge on thermal and optical behavior of SS-PCMs such that building temperatures can be passively regulated year-round under different climate conditions. An integrated experimental and computational program, consisting of multi-physics modeling, materials synthesis, system level integration, and building level evaluation for energy saving, will be performed to achieve the aforementioned goal. This project can transform the use of PCM by relying on radiation energy transfer processes to deliver heat, thus bypassing the low thermal conductivity problem inherent to PCMs. The low thermal conductivity of the SS-PCM foam also delays heat-loss, thus enhancing the ability of the system to remain at a desired temperature."

These equations play an important role in many areas of science and engineering, and they are at the basis of computer codes used today for modeling fluids, from weather prediction to aircraft and car design, and any number of other applications. Mathematically, the equations are notoriously difficult to solve and even if we use large computers, our computer models are still not as reliable as we would like. It is interesting to compare the situation for example with calculating the stress in complicated rigid structures. The stress calculations are governed by a different set of equations, and in many cases, they can be done with very good precision. One of the reasons is that the underlying equations for stress in rigid structures are much better understood mathematically. The difficulties with fluid calculations are essentially two-fold. First, the solutions are intrinsically complicated, regardless of how good our theory is. Second, our theory is fundamentally incomplete, and therefore we have to deal with a lot of uncertainty in a very difficult computational environment. While there is not much we can do about the first difficulty, the second difficulty can be addressed by improving our mathematical understanding of the equations. The ultimate goal of the research is to understand the behavior of the solutions to the degree that we would be able to design better algorithms for the solutions. The role of good theory in solving differential equations can be well illustrated on a simpler problem of solving equations of motion for planetary systems. In that case, if we use deeper mathematical properties of the equations of motion, we can significantly extend the precision of the algorithms, and make predictions for much longer time-scales. With fluid equations, the situation is more difficult, because ultimately we cannot hope to follow every drop of water when simulating, say, an ocean current, or a fast flow in a large water turbine. In the end, we have to use some averaging, and the right choice of averaging is the most difficult part. A good mathematical knowledge of the theoretical issues surrounding the fluid equations is important for achieving these goals.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the research will focus on the following areas: the generation of small scales and long-time behavior of 2d fluids, the limits of perturbation theory, model equations, and 2-d turbulence and partial damping.  By way of example we will describe our program in the study of turbulence. This work will test (at the mathematical level) our best theories of turbulence, in the 2d environment. (The 3d problems are currently out of reach).  Currently, the turbulence theory is based on some heuristic assumptions about averaging. Can the heuristics be justified mathematically? At a more technical level, what happens if we remove viscous damping on a few high Fourier modes? The heuristic turbulence theory predicts that this will have hardly any effect on the overall behavior of the fluid (in a turbulent regime). Due to recent advances in mathematical methods, this problem may now be within reach (although it is still difficult).  The remaining problems are similarly intricate, however the principal investigator has developed new methods for each of them and it is expected that significant progress will be made."

The conventional experimental probes used to characterize these systems typically do not explore techniques that are either sensitive to the atomic species or that are performed in situ.  It is imperative, therefore, to identify new experimental probes that can provide crucial information on NCs that cannot be achieved via other methods.  This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, employs state-of-the-art x-ray characterization methods to elucidate a wide range of unanswered problems in the NC literature, including the mechanism of cation exchange in NCs and effects of ligand chemistry on charge carrier dynamics in NCs.  The project focuses on both operando/in situ soft and hard x-ray absorption spectroscopy and well as ultra-fast x-ray absorption spectroscopy.  These techniques, for the most part, have not been exploited to probe the chemistry and physics of semiconductor NCs and it is anticipated that they will provide crucial insight to answer important questions regarding the bonding and charge transfer dynamics in these materials.  In turn, the results from this research proposal will have a strong impact on the ability to fabricate next generation nano-electronic materials.

In turn, the results from this research proposal will have a strong impact on the ability to fabricate next generation nano-electronic materials.  The transformative feature of this work is the use of cutting-edge x-ray techniques to probe NCs in their most common environment: solution phase.  Armed with the knowledge that the interplay between controlling carrier densities and mobilities in NCs will play a strong role in making highly conductive NC devices, the project research objectives focus on two related research thrust areas: (a) in situ x-ray spectroscopy of NC materials undergoing cation exchange processes and (b) effects of surface ligands on the interfacial charge carrier dynamics in NCs as probed by ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy.  Materials of systems of interest include CdSe as the archetypal nanomaterial.  The general mechanisms that  are investigated, however, will lead to the study of new materials, such as other binary semiconductors like PbSe or metallic nanostructures such as Ag or Pb.

The project incorporates fundamental research in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to further develop a multiscale generalized correlation framework to enable discovery and decision-making via analysis of large and complex data.

By building upon distance correlation and making use of nearest neighbors, the resulting MGC test statistic is a unique dependence measure that is consistent for testing against all dependencies with finite second moment, and it exhibits better performance than existing state-of-art methods under a wide variety of nonlinear and high-dimensional dependencies. By investigating the theoretical aspects of distance-based correlations, this project aims to further improve the finite-sample performance of MGC-style tests, extend its capability to testing dependence on network and kernel data, and broaden its utility to general inferential questions beyond dependence testing such as two-sample testing, outlier detection, and feature screening, as well as applications to brain activity, networks, and text analysis.

Transition metal catalysts are particularly useful in the production of bulk chemicals and fuels, and for cleaner fuel combustion and  pollution cleanup. For these solid catalysts, metals at the catalyst surface bind the reacting chemicals with just the right strength (or ""bond energy"") to enable their chemical conversion to the desired products.  Too tightly bound, and the product will not desorb but will remain attached to the catalyst surface.  Too weakly bound and the reactant will not adsorb, and cannot react catalytically with it.  Improving the energetics of such catalysts is essential for producing and using chemicals and fuels with higher energy efficiency and less pollution, as needed for sustainable living into the future.  The key to improving the catalysts is to find materials whose surfaces bind the reacting chemicals with the optimum bond energies.  In principle, this can be achieved by solving the equations of quantum mechanics (a branch of physics) with computers.  Unfortunately, the math is very difficult, so mathematical approximations must be made for even the fastest computers to solve the equations in reasonable times.  Experimental measurements of some of the bond energies are needed to compare to the computer results, to assess whether these approximations lead to incorrect bond energies.  In this project, Dr. Charles T. Campbell is measuring bond energies for selected chemicals bound to transition metal surfaces, carefully chosen to enable development of new quantum mechanical methods for more accurately predicting such energies, and to improve the basic understanding of the catalyst's action. Improving the energy accuracy of such fast computations is transformative in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling greater reliability in computer-based predictions of better catalyst materials. This research also provides strong interdisciplinary, research-integrated education for numerous young students, scientists and engineers, who get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art measurement instrumentation and its design.

With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Charles T.

This, in turn, improves the basic understanding of catalytic mechanisms, and facilitates the design of better catalysts. Dr. Campbell's calorimetric measurements, which cannot be performed with the same precision elsewhere in the world, are broadening the database of reliable experimental energies of adsorbed catalytic intermediates that can be used by theoreticians as benchmarks to guide development of computational methods with improved accuracy for calculating the energetics of chemical reactions at late transition metal surfaces.  While density functional theory (DFT) has been extremely successful in catalysis research, prior results proved that the mean absolute errors in the energies of adsorbed intermediates from DFT exceeds 20 kJ/mol. The experimental database being developed here greatly facilitates ongoing efforts by the theoretical community to improve the energy accuracy of such fast computational methods, while also clarifying the energetic basis for structure-reactivity correlations in transition metal catalysis. These improvements are transformative for catalysis research, enabling greater reliability in computational prediction of reaction rates and mechanisms, and higher success rates in predicting better catalyst and electrocatalyst materials that are essential for sustainable living.

In the field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps, continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic varieties."

Algebra is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, whereas model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades logic has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering. For about fifteen years, the PI has been involved in a collaborative effort to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis. These investigations are naturally related to other fields within mathematics (mainly logic and analysis) but may also lead to novel applications of differential equations in science and engineering. They recently led to some decisive positive results, and many questions which seemed out of reach previously may now be answerable.<br/><br/>More concretely, the goal of this project is to unify three seemingly very different approaches to enrich the real continuum by infinitesimal and infinite quantities: surreal numbers, germs of real-valued functions, and transseries. Surreal numbers have a combinatorial flavor and encompass Cantor's ordinal numbers; they were introduced by J. H. Conway in the 1970s in connection with game theory. Germs of real-valued functions are central objects in analysis; they were first systematically studied by P. du Bois-Reymond in the 1870s. Transseries are formal objects that model the growth rates of such germs at infinity; they arose in both analysis and logic during the 1980s. Their formal nature also makes transseries suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems. The goal of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of these structures, and to establish links between them. For example, we would like to know: Are there analytic structures (Hardy fields) with the same logical features as transseries? Is there a natural isomorphism between surreals and transseries? Answers to questions such as these may now be within grasp due to fundamental advances in our understanding of the ideas of number, series, and function within the last decade, and would exhibit heretofore unknown relationships between them."

This theory also provides the natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; Groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in dynamical systems. Today, each of the theories of Operator Algebras, Groups, and Dynamical Systems are independently of each other among most important and well-established parts of modern mathematics and mathematical physics. But the framework of operator algebras still allows deep interactions between these mathematical concepts. The aim of this project is to exploit the existing, and develop new bridges between these different theories. This allows one to utilize the current advanced mathematical technology of each area to help overcome some open problems in the others.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with various aspects of interaction between analytic group theory (and its quantum version) and operator algebras, particularly via the theory of boundaries. Measure-theoretical boundaries (e.g. the Poisson boundary), and topological boundaries (e.g. the Furstenberg boundary) of groups were introduced and developed in the 1960s and 1970s in the seminal work of Furstenberg. These concepts were used as a tool to prove certain rigidity results for lattices in Lie groups. The former type of boundaries have since been vastly investigated and used as the main tool in some of the most substantial results in the past few decades in both ergodic theory of groups and rigidity theory of von Neumann algebras. However, topological boundaries are much less understood, and surely have not been fully exploited as a similar powerful tool in continuous ergodic theory or C*-algebraic rigidity problems. These boundaries are defined abstractly in general for all discrete (and also non-discrete) groups, and they compromise all natural notions of boundaries such as Gromov's boundaries of hyperbolic groups or Furstenberg boundaries of semisimple Lie groups. The project aims to further develop the understanding of such boundaries. The goal is to apply them to generalize various results in operator algebra theory that have been proven by using special cases of such boundary actions, for example, the existing results concerning maximal injective von Neumann subalgebras and character-rigidity. In another direction, the project aims to develop and study the boundary theory of quantum groups and investigate their possible applications to problems such as C*-simplicity in the quantum setting."

Data will come from historical archives in Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco, and the project will unfold in two stages. First, a research team and laboratory will be assembled to digitize and geocode archival materials. Second, the research team will use the digitized data to examine research questions including but not limited to: A) did major scientific advances in homicide investigation techniques decrease homicide's prevalence? B) do events that erode community trust in police trigger homicide waves? C) do events that trigger sentiments of collective efficacy diminish homicide hotspots lifespan or rate-of-occurrence? Quasi-experimental research methods such as comparative interrupted time series and regression discontinuity models will be used to assess these questions. <br/><br/>	With respect to broader impacts, this project will help cities improve network and place-based homicide prevention efforts by identifying the ideal timing and duration for law enforcement and social service interventions. Similarly, the identification of events that trigger homicide waves may help cities learn how to anticipate sudden increases in violence. Finally, the project will make use of a novel method for disseminating project findings to the greater public. Through collaborations with a data visualization scientist as well as local libraries in Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco, project findings will be shared with the public through displays of large maps visualizing change in historical homicide patterns. Project maps and data visualizations will be displayed in libraries and galleries in each city to spark greater public interest and awareness about homicide and the science of prevention."

A familiar yet complex and mathematically interesting example is card shuffling, which serves as a model for many important phenomena involving the idea of mixing. More generally, randomness is used in modeling a wide range of systems, from polymers and DNA to image restoration and recognition, communication and social networks, and the behavior of financial markets. Random processes are also used as important tools for efficient computations and simulation. In all these applications, strong structural constraints associated with the complex combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the problem determine the behavior of the process. This research project is concerned with the fundamental properties of such stochastic processes and their relationship to global structures.<br/><br/>The project focusses on Markov processes that are defined in terms of a related geometric or algebraic structure. The long-term and global properties of these processes are determined by and often reflect the global structure of the underlying space. The project involves questions at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability with a major role played by groups and their actions. Partial differential equations and potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and, more generally, of solutions of the heat equation, are also at the center of many of these considerations. Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide key examples."

Biologists seek to understand how particular traits of organisms---the size of an animal or the flower color of a plant, for example---affect the chances of giving rise to a new species or suffering extinction. This project develops computational tools to help identify traits that consistently affect speciation and extinction. It further applies the tools to understand the history of particular plant groups, including ones with agriculturally and economically valuable species. Undergraduate science opportunities and mentoring specifically target veterans of the armed services. A workshop and individual advising will equip young researchers with technical skills that are valuable for a variety of future careers. The international collaboration between American and Israeli labs will train students and postdoctoral researchers and hold workshops to build communities of young scientists working with phylogenetic comparative methods.<br/><br/>Inferring trait-dependent lineage diversification from phylogenetic trees is difficult. There is currently a need for methods that are both powerful and reliable, and for tools to distinguish when methods perform well or poorly. In this project, two novel modeling techniques target weaknesses recently revealed in current methods. The first incorporates sequence evolution into models of trait evolution, to allow shifts in diversification rate to be explained by processes at both those levels. The second focuses on connections between diversification and trait shifts, rather than their values, to avoid the statistical problem of pseudoreplication. Two computational tools provided by this project improve the usage of existing and future methods. One is a community-driven database of benchmark tests to compare how methods perform across diverse scenarios. The other is a means of assessing model adequacy, to guide confidence in empirical conclusions and directions for future model development. Finally, this project investigates the macroevolutionary dynamics of two traits that have major effects on plant phenotypes and genotypes: breeding system and whole genome duplication. Methodological advances and expanded datasets provide the potential to make the strongest cases yet for the importance of species selection in shaping biodiversity."

Birkhoff in 1927.  This mathematical dynamical system serves as a good approximation to several important physical systems, for instance, sound propagation inside of a chapel or a cathedral.  This research project targets classical inverse problems for such dynamical systems, for example: if we know some properties of the particle's motion, can we infer properties of the underlying domain?  This is closely related to the question, ""Can you hear the shape of a drum?"" That is, can one reconstruct the shape of a drum solely from the sound it produces?  It turns out that properties of sound inside of a convex domain are closely related to properties of the possible trajectories of the associated reflecting particles inside of the same domain. This project aims to deepen understanding of related mathematical questions in the analysis of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is to study perturbations of convex billiards and to derive necessary conditions for integrability (for perturbation of ellipses) and for isospectrality of deformations of convex domains.  The former condition is closely related to the phenomenon of whispering galleries and the Birkhoff conjecture about characterization of integrable billiards, while the latter problem is closely related to deformation spectral rigidity.  M. Kac's question can be expressed in terms of the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation inside of a convex planar domain.  Due to the wave trace function the Laplace spectrum generically determines the length spectrum of the associated billiard inside of the same domain and connects analysis with billiards.  The second part of the project is about proving stochastic Arnold diffusion, that is, stochastic diffusing behavior for nearly integrable systems and the Chirikov conjecture.  One of challenging goals is to establish stochastic diffusive behavior inside of Kirkwood gaps for the three-body problem."

Investigating such strained molecules can teach us about structure, bonding, energetics, and chemical reactivity. It can lead to the design of new reactions for the preparations of pharmaceuticals and energetic materials. The project, which integrates elements of synthetic, mechanistic, and computational organic chemistry, is designed to provide undergraduates with a wholesome research experience, and engage them as partners in the scientific enterprise. In addition, several initiatives to promote the delivery of high quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in the local schools (K-12) will be pursued. This includes providing summer research opportunities for high school students and partnering with educators in the elementary, middle, and junior high schools to enhance STEM offerings. <br/><br/>The project contains a set of aims, appropriate for an undergraduate-driven research program, to generate strained cycloalkynes from new photochemical and thermal sources.

Matrix isolation and time-resolved laser flash photolysis will be used to study the kinetics of the cyclic alkylidenecarbene intermediates. Flash vacuum pyrolysis will be studied as a complementary approach to the photochemical route for generating these strained cycloalkynes. The chemistry of strained cycloalkynes, with respect to the pathways by which they are formed and consumed, will also be investigated by modern computational methods."

Conversion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals represents an effective strategy to simultaneously combat the problems of increased carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere and the decreased supply of fossil fuels. However, activation or splitting of carbon dioxide normally requires high temperature and pressure conditions, which puts a tremendous burden on our energy supply and environmental wellness. This pursuit focuses on just how the reaction takes place by a simple iron-sulfur enzyme, which will provide a crucial framework for future adaptations of this novel type of reaction for recycling the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into useful products. As such, it has broad scientific impacts on our society by addressing two of the most important challenges we face nowadays: fossil fuel depletion and climate change. In addition, incorporation of this research into training of current students and outreach to prospective students raises public interest and awareness of the importance of this line of research and, therefore, has broader impacts on the education of future generations.<br/><br/>This project investigates the mechanism of in vitro carbon dioxide activation by the iron protein of nitrogenase and the engineering of an Azotobacter vinelandii strain with improved efficiency of in vivo carbon dioxide reduction upon expression of the iron protein. Guided by theoretical calculations, the proposed research employs a combination of genetic, biochemical, spectroscopic and structural approaches to tackle the unique reaction of carbon dioxide reduction by the all-ferrous iron protein and address several fundamental questions related to the mechanism of this reaction. Further, a combination of screening and expression strategies are used to identify iron proteins or homologs with higher efficiencies of carbon dioxide reduction and improve the specificity of electron transfer to the iron protein during the process of carbon dioxide reduction. The outcome of these studies provides important insights into how iron-sulfur based catalysts work to effect carbon dioxide activation and reduction under ambient conditions and what principles can be derived from studies of A. vinelandii for future development of cost-efficient, whole-cell-based strategies for carbon dioxide conversion."

Materials exhibiting a large magnetocaloric effect are of interest for refrigeration applications because magnetocaloric refrigeration does not use ozone depleting gases necessary in conventional gas compression refrigerators. Magnetic refrigeration is up to 20% more efficient than conventional refrigeration and has potential to lessen environmental impact and decrease energy demands of cooling, that is a significant portion of US yearly energy usage, Magnetocaloric cooling refrigerators have been announced for consumer products as early as 2020. Magnetocaloric cooling could also be used for thermal management, resulting in more efficient motors both for commercial and military defense vehicles. The materials to be studied are new alloys that fit applications requiring durable materials, as they have previously been studied for use in extreme temperature and pressure environments making them viable for active cooling and thermal management of engines. The project will engage outreach programs at Florida Polytechnic University  and  mentor high school  science  students.    <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) refers to the temperature change of a magnetic material on application of a magnetic field, H. Materials with a large magnetocaloric response near room temperature can be used for magnetic cooling. Critical rare earths metals (REs)compounds were first studied because of large magnetocaloric effects near room temperature. However, the increasing cost and scarcity of REs limits their use for commercial refrigeration, so transition metal-based replacementss have been investigated. Magnetocaloric materials are classified by undergoing: (1) a 1st  order magneto-structural phase transition, or (2) a 2nd order magnetic transition. 1st order transitions have a large, narrow peak magnetic entropy changes in a magneto-structural phase transition, but this is accompanied by thermal hysteresis making them  less desirable for multi-cycle cooling. 2nd  order phase transitions have a small but broad magnetic entropy change. The broad entropy change gives these 2nd order phase transition materials a larger working temperature range increasing their refrigeration capacity, RC. Optimal magnetocaloric materials require a relatively large peak entropy change, a large RC and working temperature range, low thermal hysteresis, and resistance to thermomechanical fatigue. <br/>	The studies will focus on the role of crystallographic disorder and pressure on exchange interactions in multi-component high entropy alloys to assess the maximum magnetocaloric effect in these materials. These multi-component alloys have tunable Curie temperatures, Tc, magnetocaloric response, and refrigeration capacity. We will model how positional disorder affects the magnetic phase transition and magnetocaloric response of the system. Quaternary and quinternary Fe-Co-Ni-based alloys are of interest because distributed J(R) allows Tc tuning and control of RCs, through the breadth of the 2nd order transition, while the Fe-Co-Ni basis allows for a larger average magnetic moment of the system, which increases the magnetocaloric response. We will (1) observe structure under pressure, P, at Argonne National Lab with pressure cells that can reach P > 6 GPa.; (2) extend random exchange models with band theory to understand Tc tuning in multicomponent systems and P-dependence of the Bethe-Slater curve; (3) investigate pairwise exchange interactions using band theory that includes spin-orbit interactions in fully relativistic formalisms to confirm J(R)'s predicted by the Bethe-Slater curve; (4) study pressure dependent atomic spacing in fcc-based HEA?s, measured at synchrotron facilities, to be used with calculated J(R)'s to predict T-dependent magnetization and MCE; (5) confirm M(T) predictions by P-dependent susceptibility measurements; and (6) measure magnetic hyperfine field distributions using Mossbauer spectroscopy below Tc in technologically relevant alloys.

The method of supersymmetry is widely used in theoretical physics, especially in particle physics, but its rigorous mathematical foundation is still a challenge for mathematicians. The aim of the project is to develop a broad mathematical understanding of supersymmetry.<br/><br/>More precisely, random band matrices (RBM) represent quantum systems on a d-dimensional lattice with random quantum transition amplitudes effective up to distances of some order W, which is called a bandwidth. They are natural intermediate models in the study eigenvalue statistics and quantum propagation of disordered systems;  they interpolate between Wigner random matrices and random Schrodinger operators. Wigner matrix ensembles represent models without spatial structure, where the quantum transition rates between any two sites are independent identically distributed random variables. In contrast, random Schrodinger operators have only a random diagonal potential in addition to the deterministic Laplacian on a large box in a d-dimensional lattice. The main feature of RBM is that they can be used to model the Anderson metal-insulator phase transition in three or more dimensions. It is conjectured that the crossover for RBM can be investigated even in dimension one by varying the bandwidth W; however, on a mathematical level of rigor the question is still open. The investigator is going to attack the problem using the supersymmetry approach in combination with powerful analytic and statistical mechanics techniques, including saddle point analysis, transfer operators, and multi-scale analysis."

Theory predicts that rapid adaptation can also potentially affect the establishment of species in new habitats, but there is little evidence from natural systems to support this. This project will investigate rapid adaptation in recently established plant populations, as well as how symbiotic microbes might influence plant rapid adaptation. By conducting this work at an ecological restoration site, this project will not only expand our understanding of basic ecological processes, but results of the project can be applied to make restorations more successful. This is important, as the restoration of degraded landscapes can play a critical role in biodiversity conservation, yet species sown into restorations often fail to establish. Additionally, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate students and development of online educational materials for K-12 students.<br/><br/>By using field experiments, reciprocal transplants, and greenhouse studies, this project aims to expand understanding of the role of rapid adaptation in population establishment in several ways. First, although empirical evidence suggests that evolution may occur rapidly enough to influence establishment, few studies consider the demographic effects of adaptation. This study will examine the demographic effects of adaptation in recently established plant populations. Second, this work aims to identify the selective agents and traits responsible for local adaptation, which few studies attempt to do. By combining selection analyses with reciprocal transplant experiments, this study will both predict evolutionary responses and test whether those predicted evolutionary shifts have actually occurred. Finally, this work will investigate the role of microbial mutualists in plant rapid adaptation by examining interactions between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria and how traits mediating interactions with rhizobia have evolved in response to field environments that differ in soil nutrient availability and rhizobium community properties. The results of this work will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between rapid adaptation and population establishment."

In this study, researchers will manipulate the abundance and presence of fungi and bacteria in spotted locoweed plants. Spotted locoweed hosts a fungus that synthesizes a potent, bioactive compound that can harm livestock. This fungus is carried in seeds, and is thus passed down to the next generation of locoweeds. The interaction between these fungi and their locoweed hosts is responsible for millions of dollars in damages annually in the Western United States, yet little is known regarding how these fungi affect the ability of their hosts to grow and reproduce. In addition, many other microbes inhabit locoweeds, most with unknown ecological roles. Researchers will manipulate microbes in locoweeds to better understand the function and importance of the entire microbial communities in these important plants. Because microbes occur in all plants, results from this experiment will have implications that extend across many plants beyond locoweed, including agricultural crops.

Variation among treatment groups in plant traits, including reproductive and defensive traits, will be assayed. Additionally, arthropod, fungal, and bacterial communities of each treatment group will be characterized and co-occurrence patterns analyzed to understand how members of the plant microbiome influence one another and plant-associated arthropods. The study will generate novel results regarding the functional role of the plant microbiome and how interactions among microbes shape ecological communities."

Endophytic fungi can actually help living plants in various ways, including the improvement of nutrient uptake and protection from pathogens. However, fungi are also known to be proficient decomposers of dead plant material.

Although active fungal species were found to be structured according to the senescence gradient of the moss, several fungi inhabit both the living (top) and decomposing (bottom) portions of the plant, providing multiple candidate fungal species to study trophic transitions between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism. The researchers will isolate some of these fungi in pure cultures and use them in an experiment designed to quantify the effects of focal fungal strains on living and dead moss tissues. Using co-culture experiments of these fungi with moss plants, this project will characterize the phenotypic, and transcriptomic, responses of mosses to their associated fungi. This research will use also the same moss-fungus system to monitor differential gene expression associated with a switch between symbiotrophism and saprotrophism by three very different fungal species."

Bacteria are the engines that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles and help to sustain life.  Scientific papers are published daily on what types of bacteria live in every imaginable ecosystem. Scientists have found patterns of bacteria community composition in relation to environmental (e.g. temperature, pH, etc.) or host (e.g. disease history, cancer state, etc.) characteristics, but the underlying reasons for the observed patterns remain unclear. Connecting these patterns to a general conceptual framework of how microbes interact with each other and their environment will help scientists to better manage microbes in systems that directly affect people such as human pathogens and wastewater treatment plants.  This research will be a step towards addressing this gap in knowledge by adapting frameworks developed in plant systems based on functional characteristics (traits) to microbial ecology, allowing examination of connections between lake bacterial diversity and ecosystems processes using a mechanistic approach.  A computational workflow of this project's analysis will be publicly available and used to create open access online educational tools to aid in teaching computational analyses, scientific reproducibility, and programming literacy. Finally, this workflow will be put together to teach a half day workshop at the Ecological Society of America conference.  <br/><br/>This research examines how the relationship between bacterial diversity and secondary productivity is constrained by the traits that determine community assembly. Through a comparative genomic analysis of published and newly reconstructed bacterial genomes from environmental genomic data, this project will identify DNA-inferred (a) response traits that control the differences in bacterial community composition and (b) effect traits that determine the presence or absence of a diversity-productivity relationship.  The identified genes and inferred traits will help expand current understanding of how bacterial community assembly and processes affect ecosystem function.  This understanding will improve linkages between microbial community and ecosystem ecology principles."

For example, one reaction of interest is that between carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen atoms (H), which can be accelerated when CO2 and H first adsorb on a copper surface (in other words, the metal surface is acting as a catalyst).  Prof. Harrison's research aims to reveal how the initial structures formed when molecules and/or atoms collide with a metal surface determine the products of the reaction and the rates of the reaction.  Understanding the details of molecule-surface reactions may aid the design of next generation catalysts and catalytic processes.  In this way, the research may help advance catalytic technologies to more efficiently make products from natural gas, transformations that currently consume approximately 2% of global energy, and to use carbon dioxide as a chemical feedstock in ways that would reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. Further broader impacts of this research stem from the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the design and construction of advanced experimental instrumentation and complex computer modeling. Outreach activities include giving lessons and lab demonstrations at local elementary and middle schools and providing expanded research opportunities to minority and Federal Work Study undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The dynamics of activated chemisorption are probed using a heated effusive molecular beam impinging on a single crystal metal surface to measure dissociative/associative sticking probabilities, S(Tg, Ts; angle), as functions of gas & surface temperatures and angle of incidence. New measurements of product state distributions from pulsed laser assisted thermal associative/dissociative desorption (LAAD/LADD) reactions at surfaces will address activated chemisorption beginning from the surface side of the reaction barrier. Interpreted through the principle of detailed balance, the LAAD/LADD measurements define translational energy- resolved thermal sticking probabilities S(Et, T; angle), directly relevant to thermally-driven industrial catalysis. The laser methods provide unique new opportunities to characterize extremely low activated sticking probabilities and to even discriminate between chemically- specific reaction pathways such as C-C or C-H bond cleavage in ethane dissociative chemisorption. The experimental measurements, coupled with dynamically-biased microcanonical theoretical modeling, are being used to test and quantify the control of dynamics over catalytic reactivity, and to relate this dynamical control to specific transition state properties."

Through this fellowship, the awardee will work with the distinguished plant biologist Dr. Zhong-Hua Chen at Western Sydney University in New South Wales, Australia to study the MADS-box genes in ferns compared to flowering plants, which include many well-studied crops. This study will provide new insights into the ancestral MADS-box genes and the changes that have occurred in this group of genes throughout the evolutionary history of plants.<br/><br/>Investigations of the MADS-box gene family have been a key facet of plant evolution research for nearly three decades due to their major role in development and putative role in the massive diversification of flowering plants.

In addition, the absence of a published reference genome in ferns, sister group to seed plants, has left an egregious gap in our understanding of MADS-box evolution across all of land plants. By collaborating with Dr. Zhong-Hua Chen, the awardee will use functional genetics to verify, localize, and quantify the putative MADS-box genes throughout the life cycle of the model fern, Ceratopteris richardii, the first study of this kind for a non-seed plant.

The research will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will include the collection and analysis of qualitative data from interviews, focus groups, and chat-based discussions. The second phase will use data from the qualitative findings to develop a quantitative instrument that will capture the factors articulated by faculty that impact the retention and success of African American students in STEM. Data will be analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding methods to uncover salient emergent categories and themes, and the constant comparative method will be used to gain additional insights on the research findings.

Nitrogen fertilizer production helps meet this need.  However, adding excess nitrogen drastically alters natural habitats such as salt marshes and others that receive water as runoff from land. Coastal wetlands provide several ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish and birds, storm surge protection, and nutrient filtration. Prior studies suggest that excess nitrogen may increase decomposition in these sediments, resulting in faster degradation of complex organic matter to carbon dioxide. What controls these processes, and the micro-organisms responsible for them is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of added nitrogen on organic matter decomposition. This research will provide an in-depth analysis of the members of the salt marsh microbiome and their activities in marsh sediments. Data will provide insight into how  salt marshes are responding to nitrogen fertilizer runoff, information that is essential for the adaptive management of coastal wetland systems and their response to environmental change. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled flow through reactor systems to investigate the mechanistic effect of nitrate on microbial decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter. We hypothesize that, because nitrate is a favorable electron acceptor in heterotrophic, microbial respiration, it can promote oxidation of organic matter that would otherwise remain unprocessed. Current biogeochemical data indicate a significant increase in microbial respiration, particularly denitrification, in response to nitrate addition, with the most pronounced effect in deep sediments ranging from 150 to 200 years old. This is significant, because organic matter at this depth is typically thought to be more resistant to microbial degradation, which means that the capacity of salt marshes to store carbon may lessen with eutrophication. To further assess these results, we need to gain a better understanding of the microbial consortia responsible for organic matter decomposition. Microbial activity plays a critical role in controlling how much carbon is decomposed; though we know little about salt marsh sediment microbiome structure and function, and how it may change in response to nitrate addition. Accordingly, this dissertation improvement grant will contribute to existing data by taking an integrated 'meta-omics' approach. To complement flow through reactor experiments, the microbial genetic underpinnings of organic matter decomposition under conditions of nutrient enrichment will be investigated using metagenomics, and the metabolic activity of these microbial players will be assessed by measuring the expression of the microbial metatranscriptome. These data have the potential to reveal novel microbial lineages from deep salt marsh sediment, and draw unique linkages between microbial gene expression patterns and changes in organic carbon quality. Successful integration of these meta-omics approaches with existing geochemical rate measurements will vastly improve our understanding of the role of microbes in organic matter decomposition, and potentially allow for a better predictive understanding for how carbon storage capacity in salt marshes will respond to future nitrogen loading."

Precursory eastward traveling planetary-scale waves in the mesosphere are thought to play a triggering role in initiating such abrupt breakdown of the wintertime polar vortex, but their origin and importance are not well understood. The atmospheric response to the vortex's demise can in turn excite westward traveling planetary-scale waves and amplify atmospheric tidal disturbances. However, the impacts and mechanisms of these responses in the upper mesospheric and lower thermospheric region are still unclear. This project combines analysis from space-based (Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, or MLS and Sounding of the Atmosphere using the Broadband Emission Radiometry, or SABER) and ground-based sensors (network of high-frequency radars), reanalysis, and a global chemistry-climate model to further illuminate the roles and causes of these traveling waves and tidal disturbances with respect to sudden stratospheric warming. <br/><br/>Understanding the impacts of these atmospheric perturbations may improve knowledge of space physics and the assessments of stratospheric ozone loss and wintertime climate evolution. Specifically, these perturbations can promote strong ionospheric variability that alters global communications and induce forcings that enhance the downwelling of ozone-destroying chemical species from the upper mesosphere. New insights on precursory mesospheric waves prior to the vortex breakdown can assist seasonal forecasting. Importantly, the research activities will offer experiential learning opportunities for undergraduates on cutting-edge research that is unique in South Carolina and the greater Southeastern Regions. While serving as frameworks for a doctoral thesis, project results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at a state-supported Liberal Arts institution that is embarking on its first and only doctoral program in atmospheric science related degree."

Culler-Shalen theory provides the most general tools for constructing such surfaces and has been instrumental in the resolution of many well-known questions. These special surfaces split naturally into two classes: those with boundary and those without. Much of Culler-Shalen theory's power comes from a deep understanding of the surfaces with boundary that one can construct with these tools. On the other hand, very little is known about the associated surfaces without boundary. In this project, we will use a novel algebraic perspective on Culler-Shalen theory to study the associated surfaces without boundary. Our work will resolve numerous problems concerning Culler-Shalen theory itself and will also open the door to applying the theory to an even broader  class of questions about 3-manifolds. This research will be conducted in collaboration wth Dr. Stephan Tillman, a leading expert on Culler-Shalen theory and 3-manifolds, at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>More specifically, Culler-Shalen theory uses the algebraic geometry of a 3-manifold's character variety and a construction, due to Stallings, to build essential surfaces in the manifold. The A-polynomial and the Culler-Shalen norm both determine precisely which boundary slopes arise in this fashion when the manifold's boundary consists of a single torus. However, not every boundary slope is detected by Culler-Shalen theory. We will address an analogous question concerning the detected closed essential surfaces using a module-theoretic perspective on character varieties developed by Chesebro. In particular, we hope to construct an innite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with torus boundary containing closed essential surfaces that are not detected by the character variety. We will also explore the connection between the singular slopes of a closed surface and the bounded surfaces which are weakly detected by the character variety. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Results from the project may lead to new generations of high performance semiconducting plastics suitable for applications in diverse energy conversion and storage technologies.  The project is also relevant to sustainability in that electron transporting semiconducting polymers show promise to be low-cost, sustainable, and scalable-manufactured materials with improved properties compared to inorganic oxides now widely used in photoanodes for photoelectrochemical cells for efficient production of fuels (e.g. hydrogen in aqueous cells).

The project involves experiments on two systems: a sheared 2D disordered solid formed by colloidal particles adsorbed at an oil-water interface; and the interface between two fluids (e.g. water and air) inside a roughened channel, in which the pinned contact line evolves as fluid is injected and withdrawn. In both experiments the PI and students apply many cycles of driving, making microscopic and mechanical observations to test how these systems are changed and programmed by the driving. The main goal is to test and develop the idea that there exist generic classes of memory behavior. Specifically, the two experimental systems feature comparable yielding and depinning transitions, and so are an opportunity to connect common physics to a common class of memory.

This selectivity is accomplished by catalyst design, combined with novel experimental techniques in collaboration with scientists at Merck Research Laboratories. This university-industry collaboration is leveraged to enhance the broader impact of the research. Students participating in on-site research visits at Merck are working with Dr. Stahl and campus safety representatives at UW-Madison to help implement new industry-based safety protocols within the University research environment.

The catalyst and reaction development efforts are closely coupled to rigorous mechanistic studies that implement innovative mechanistic tools such as a high-pressure NMR reactor capable of on-line continuous delivery of O2 at pressure and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A strategic collaboration with scientists at Merck Research Laboratories provides access to high-throughput experimentation and analysis to discover catalytic allylic oxidation reactions that enable selective late-stage functionalization of natural products or existing pharmaceuticals.

This project will be based on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the connection and management of different assets in a healthcare facility or military materiel supply chain. This project will develop a template for the integration of mesh radio frequency identification (RFID) of emitted but encrypted radio frequency (RF) signals in conformance to IEEE 802.15.4 standards over the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band. The device will be used in conjunction with the cloud where data will be processed in a wireless configuration. Coupled with the development of this module is a dynamic data analytic procedure that incorporates novel machine learning statistical routines for maintenance forecasts."

Generally speaking, geometric analysis involves using analytic methods to solve problems in differential geometry and general relativity. This workshop will bring together mathematicians, including top experts in the field, to communicate recent progress and to promote interaction and collaboration among the participants.  In particular, the goals of the conference are to disseminate new advances in geometric analysis, to contribute to the training of graduate students, and to bring a large group of mathematicians to exchange and to incubate new mathematical ideas. To realize these goals, junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) and researchers from various under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply and will be given priority for financial support from the organizing committee.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring leading experts from all over the world to present the new results and/or surveys of current progresses in geometric analysis, in particular, from the following subfields: (1) Analysis of geometric PDE including curvature flows (e.g., power of Gauss curvature flow, Ricci flow, gradient Ricci solitons, and manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound); (2) Kahler-Einstein metrics and the Kahler-Ricci flow (e.g., singular Kahler metrics, the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kahler manifolds, the regularity and weak solutions of Kahler-Ricci flow, and Kahler-Ricci solitons); (3) Minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flow (e.g., special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry, min-max theory from the proof of Willmore conjecture, and the formation of singularities of mean curvature flow); and (4) Mathematical general relativity (e.g., space-like hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, the center of mass, and the nonlinear gluing approach). Since 2010 PIMS Workshop on Geometric Analysis, there are many exciting new results and new techniques in these fields, and the conference will have about 25 speakers discussing these advances. The abstract of talks and videos from the workshop will be posted on the conference webpage http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170724-ccga"

Because no single species is a perfect model of human biology, science benefits from a broad portfolio of model organisms, each with its own relevance to human biology. This project will create new methods to study an emerging model, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This small fish offers an important advantage over traditional lab models. Since the glaciers retreated in the northern hemisphere ~12,000 years ago, many beneficial genetic variants have survived in thousands of distinct natural populations. Unlike laboratory genetic screens, which reveal mutations in genes causing abnormal development or physiology, these natural variants reveal biological innovations: new ways of resisting parasites, for instance. A large community of researchers (>100 labs) now studies stickleback to understand behavior, development, and immunology. The research team has identified candidate genes affecting important traits like brain and bone development, but require tools to experimentally alter gene function for confirmation. This grant will support a team of five researchers developing new gene-editing methods for stickleback. Because stickleback are easily studied in the wild as well, this research team can take the unique step of linking laboratory genetics back to gene function in their natural environment. The researchers will train undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from around the world, via new online communities and in-person courses. The project will also build infrastructure (a stock center) to perpetuate research-useful populations and provide research experiences for Native American students and communities, exposing them to scientific studies of local native animals.<br/><br/>Stickleback are a leading model in organismal biology for several reasons: 1. Marine populations independently colonized many diverse coastal watersheds, yielding exceptional phenotypic variation from a massively replicated natural experiment. 2. Ancestral alleles persist in modern oceanic populations, enabling genetic mapping of adaptive traits in known ecological contexts. 3. Stickleback are easy to breed and manipulate in large numbers in the lab and in nature. 4. Published genomes, transcriptomes, and microbiomes provide references for robust candidate gene identification and probe development. Consequently, hundreds of researchers study the genetics of stickleback adaptation. However, this research is largely confined to correlative approaches: QTL mapping, divergence mapping, and association studies. It remains rare for researchers to validate suspected candidate genes using experimental gene manipulation. To enable functional genomic studies of stickleback, this project will refine methods for gene editing. First, the research team will use transcriptomics and ChIP-Seq to improve genome annotation, to better locate candidate genes. Second, they will develop methods for more efficient gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 delivered via embryo microinjection or cell culture transfection, or using viral-mediated gene transfer. Finally, the team will construct a stock center where natural and transgenic lines can be maintained and shipped to users, enabling studies on standardized genetic backgrounds spanning sticklebacks? natural diversity. The work will be disseminated via webinars, methods blogs, cross training of students, and a large lab course. This will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and colleagues around the world, as well as Native American communities in Alaska."

Based on the needs for portable storage filled by batteries at present, a technology that increases lifetimes between charging by ten times will impact multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, test equipment, medical instruments, and small autonomous vehicles.  The result will be greater flexibility and versatility imparted to the various systems impacted, and greater utility and benefit to their users.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project leverages a recent discovery in hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). The structural components of the TFFC are constructed completely from soft materials, rather than rigid and more dense metals, plastics or composites. The result is that the device is ultra-thin (< 1 mm), sheet-like, and may be bent into almost any arbitrary shape. It is also extremely light and has among the highest recorded power densities on a mass or volume basis for compact, air-breathing, fuel cells.  The fuel cell was discovered through research on the implementation of low-cost two-dimensional device fabrication involving nano-imprint lithography. The device was found to have five times the power density (W/kg) of state-of-the-art commercially available ultra-light, compact fuel cells. Moreover, the TFFC is completely passive with respect to oxygen supply and thermal management, needing no extra sub-systems for these functions."

Complex numbers  and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic properties. For example, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations. This project has significant educational and training aspects:  At least two graduate students and one undergraduate student will be actively involved in this project. Also, the principal investigator will continue to organize international conferences on several complex variables and complex geometry, bringing together mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.<br/><br/>In the research aspect,  the principal investigator will continue his work on several fundamental problems in complex analysis of several variables that are closely related to research in differential geometry, algebraic geometry and classical dynamics.

The United States now produces over 25 terawatt hours of electricity per year, with the vast majority being provided by non-renewable fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. Developing new technologies that are more efficient than existing ones, or technologies that help existing technologies use energy more efficiently, is therefore critical to our future. Over the last few decades, it has become clear that energy storage devices are a key component in a wide range of proposed technologies. The technical requirements vary dramatically based on the specific constraints of each desired application, and as such there is need for a wide range of functional materials, chemistries, and architectures that can be used to build targeted and specific energy storage devices. The research, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, focuses on developing non-toxic, inexpensive manufacturing methods for three potential anode materials that could be used in lithium and sodium rechargeable batteries.  These materials are known, but how they degrade (and why) is not.  Understanding how these materials work and what their key limitations are is the main goal of this study. This is the critical first step toward finding out how to extend the life of these materials and thereby the life of batteries. This Solid State and Materials Chemistry award furthermore enables the principle investigator to conduct outreach activities related to her research involving students at all grade levels as well as the general public and policymakers. For example, the CSU 'Chemistry Club' engages elementary school students, high school students are mentored by the principle investigator and her students in the research lab, the principle investigator gives invited talks about science at local clubs, and she is a board member of the Colorado Clean Energy Cluster, which impacts policy in Colorado directly.<br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Battery materials that store large amounts of lithium and operate reversibly at the extreme ends of the electrochemical potential range of electrolytes enable high voltage and high energy density battery cells. Among available candidates, elemental alloying materials such antimony and related antimonides possess exceptionally high volumetric capacities and operate at potentials close to the plating of lithium metal, allowing for high theoretical energy density. Nevertheless, they suffer from low reversibility as a result of large changes in their volume during cycling, and poor surface passivation that causes significant degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface and a subsequent rise in the cell impedance. This work develops direct electrodeposition methods for producing low-cost, high-performance anodes for alkali metal ion (lithium and sodium) rechargeable batteries. The advantage of using electrodeposition is that the composition and morphology of the material can be controlled, and inactive binders are completely eliminated (which greatly aides in the characterization of the functional materials). The research endeavor involves a strategy of synthesizing directly electrodeposited thin films and nanostructures of three key antimonides (nickel, copper, and zinc and animonide) and characterizing them fully to develop a deeper understanding of the lithiation and delithiation reactions that occur as a function of composition, and how these reactions may lead to degradation and ultimately cell failure. Observing the phase formation and elemental composition across films during cycling further aids in the development of a clear model of how these materials work, how they degrade, and ultimately, the development of hypotheses for how to extend cycle life and utility. With this grant the principle investigator also conducts a variety of educational and outreach activities. Besides engaging students at all grade levels in STEM-related activities, she also communicates her findings directly to the general public through invited talks about science at local clubs and as a board member of the Colorado Clean Energy Cluster, which serves to impact policy in Colorado related to the economic development of clean tech companies."

Turbulence plays a pivotal role in countless engineering and industrial applications such as the design of land and aircraft, where the production of turbulence must be understood deeply to achieve energy efficient and effective technology.  It has long been believed that the inner workings of turbulence may be understood in terms of the differential equations that are being used to model fluid motion, including the Euler equations.  However, the analysis of these equations has proved so difficult that much of the relationship between turbulence and solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics remains conjectural and unresolved.  Recently through the work of the investigator and other mathematicians, a new approach has emerged to analyze solutions to fluid equations that have rapid fluctuations comparable to what is seen in turbulence.  This approach is intimately tied to questions in the mathematical discipline of geometry.  This research project aims to push this new approach towards its fullest potential to improve the understanding of turbulence and to expand the frontiers of what can be accomplished through mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the PI will prove rigorous results on the structure of ""weak solutions"" to the equations of fluid dynamics, including the incompressible Euler equations.  The results will address the extent to which such weak solutions can be shown to exhibit the properties observed or predicted of turbulent flows.  One direction of research will relate to the phenomenon of anomalous dissipation of energy and the extent to which this phenomenon may exist and be generic or stable under perturbation.  The PI will consider analogues and extensions of Onsager's conjecture on anomalous dissipation, and will also investigate fine properties of the dynamical structure of general weak solutions to the Euler and related equations.  The research will implement and expand upon the method of convex integration, as well as introduce new tools of geometric or harmonic analysis as needed."

In a rapidly changing world, there is an urgent need to understand the importance of these processes in species formation and the impact of these processes on how scientists identify and name species. This research program will study genetic, venom protein, and anatomical data to test how natural selection shapes and maintains species, and it will use these results to test several approaches for appropriately identifying species in nature. The researchers will focus on a widespread and medically important group of rattlesnake species (Western Rattlesnakes and their close relatives) as a model system to study species formation. Many previous studies have disagreed about how many species should be recognized within this group of snakes, and different populations can produce diverse symptoms from snake bite due to differences in venom biochemistry. This study will resolve these issues by developing a new system for naming species, provide new insight into the process of species formation, develop new methods for identifying species, and refine the appropriate medical treatment of snakebite in North America. The proposed research includes methodological and theoretical scientific innovation, undergraduate and graduate student training, establishment of collaborative networks, and public outreach. Public outreach will be conducted at the Dallas and Denver Zoos, thereby reaching millions of public visitors per year.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this research program are to understand the interaction of admixture and selection in speciation, and to leverage an empirical system to test how these processes may influence coalescent-based species delimitation methods. This research program will focus on the Western Rattlesnake species group (Crotalus viridis species complex and its sister taxon, C. scutulatus; collectively Cvos hereafter) as a study system. This recently diverged species complex has offered major challenges for systematics, yet provides an ideal model system for studying speciation and species delimitation. This integrated study will combine genomic and phenotypic data to delimit species, inform species delimitation approaches, and provide new genome-scale insight into the process of speciation. This research program will also test hypotheses about the repeatability of patterns selection in the processes of speciation and resistance to gene flow and hybridization. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) integrate genome-wide sampling and ecological niche modeling to infer population structure and test hypotheses of gene flow among lineages of Cvos; (2) analyze selection in contact zones between putative taxa by integrating niche modeling, genotypic, and phenotypic data to test hypotheses regarding divergence and selection in the speciation process; and (3) develop and test new approaches for delimiting species that more appropriately handle admixture and selection, and apply these methods to test taxonomic hypotheses for the Cvos complex. Successful completion of the project will provide important data to understanding the role of admixture and selection in speciation and vastly improve our analytical methods for delimiting species in the presence of interbreeding across organismal groups. Additionally, an added benefit of the project is the information that will be obtained regarding venom complexity and evolution, which could contribute to better treatment of envenomation from snake bites."

In particular, the Texoma (northeast Texas Oklahoma area) worker shortage in the advanced manufacturing sector is severe enough to short-circuit both its own rebound and its contributions to local economic growth. This project at Grayson College in Texas evolved following a 2015 study commissioned by the regional workforce board and area economic development corporations that was designed to identify best practices which could be replicated to prepare the next generation of employees for advanced manufacturing careers. In collaboration with the Texoma Manufacturing Steering Committee, which is comprised of 30 industry and educational members, it is designed to expand the pipeline of skilled employers by implementing the New Blue Academy, a comprehensive career awareness and advanced technological education initiative targeting dual enrollment high school students in rural north Texas. During this project, perceptions of middle-skill jobs will be enhanced through the promotion of technical careers among 9,200 high school students in the Texoma area. It will boost the ATE pipeline by developing an industry-designed dual-credit ATE curriculum offered in 21 high schools that will permit students to simultaneously jump-start their college education and a career. Successes will be shared with community colleges through conferences and social media sources, such as the ATE Conference, Mentor Connect, Hi-TEC, and ATECentral.com. <br/><br/>Upon completion of the program a student will receive 41 college credit hours, a Basic and an Advanced Manufacturing Technology Certificate, an experiential internship, and potential employment with an industry partner. A plan to incentivize employers and students to complete the remaining 19 hours for an A.A.S. Degree in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies will be developed. Objectives are to: 1) change perceptions of middle-skill jobs and promote technical career opportunities among high school students, teachers, and parents; 2) design and implement an industry-driven curriculum that addresses common technical skills across multiple manufacturing environments; and, 3) pilot the dual-credit New Blue Career Pathway with two high school partners, beginning in the tenth grade and culminating with an internship the summer following high school graduation. Curricular materials will be adapted from two ATE funded programs (the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center and the 360 Degree Manufacturing and Applied Engineering Center of Excellence in Michigan) as well as those available from the database of state approved courses in the Texas Workforce Education Course Manual. Existing manufacturing activities will be broadened to promote ATE career awareness events among high school instructors, counselors, and parents. The established steering committee will ensure ongoing input into the array of elements to be implemented. Evaluation will be guided by an experienced, external evaluator who will: 1) examine the success of the project in relation to benchmarks achieved by existing ATE models; 2) analyze the impact of awareness and recruitment efforts; and 3) measure student success as its relates to completion, competency, and employability."

Many microorganisms live and function in environments in which fluid flow is present. Examples include algae in lowland rivers and ocean, bacteria in the gut and intestines, phytoplankton in oceans, and sperm cell in human reproductive tracts. Here, the PI is interested in the transport and mixing of microorganisms in flows in order to gain insight into many poorly understood phenomena, some of which are mentioned above. From a technological point of view, motility and flow interactions are of much interest in applications that include fermentation processes for vaccine & food production, sewage treatment plants, and production of biofuels. These processes stand to greatly benefit from a better understanding of the nontrivial coupling between flow and motility. Here, the PI proposes a systematic experimental investigation on the effects of (i) flow on the transport & mixing properties of swimming microorganisms and (ii) of active stresses on the imposed 2D time-periodic flows. The research team is composed of a graduate student who is receiving training in fluid dynamics, biophysics, experimental & statistical methods, and nonlinear dynamics. The research team also includes undergraduate students, who are supervised by the PI and the graduate student. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this investigation can be useful in the development of new models for the transport and mixing of active matter and of forced active flows.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: The main goal of this proposal is to develop fundamental understanding on the transport, mixing, and dynamics of swimming microorganisms in flows with complex spatiotemporal structures. These processes are experimentally investigated in well-controlled flows in an electromagnetically driven thin fluid layer placed atop an array of magnets. A time-periodic current that travels horizontally through the fluid layer results in Lorenz forces that drive a (time-periodic) flow in the fluid. Spatially- and time-resolved velocity fields are obtained using particle tracking methods and differentiated to obtain the flow stretching fields or Lagrangian structures. Stretching fields are intimately related to the rate of divergence of initially nearby-points, which in chaotic flows is exponential in time (t) on the average.  These stretching fields have been used to characterize the mixing dynamics, predict mixing rates, and the transport of passive impurities and particles, and are applied to study active matter (i.e. swimming microorganisms) under flow. Experimentally computed stretching fields are instrumental in understanding the Lagrangian dynamics, transport, and mixing of self-propelled microorganisms such as the bacterium V. cholerea and the alga C. reinhardtii. The knowledge obtained from the proposed work can be potentially useful for the successful design of controllable underwater autonomous vehicles (micro-swimming robots), the prevention of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with drinking water, and development of accurate models for the dispersion of planktonic matter in oceans. Using such methods, the PI hopes to address many outstanding questions such as: (i) What are the main flow parameters governing the transport and mixing of swimming microorganisms in time-periodic flows? (ii) How are the dynamics of the swimming suspension affected by flow? Does 'bacterial superfluidity' leads to enhanced transport? (iii) Do microorganisms align with regions of high stretching and unstable manifolds? (iv) Is mixing enhanced or hindered by the microorganisms' swimming action?

The goals of the GRC-AEM are to provide an open forum for presentation and discussion of the latest research in related microbial sciences.  Microorganisms exert a profound influence on life on Earth, sustaining our environment, influencing our health, and driving industrial biotechnology. Previous AEM-GRCs have helped to advance research in industrial laboratories, colleges and universities, research foundations, and government laboratories.  <br/><br/>Gordon Research Conferences explore the frontiers of science in the chemical, biological and physical sciences. Established in 1950, the  (AEM) GRC is one of the longest running GRCs.  The 2017 GRC-AEM, subtitled Human and Microbial Perspectives of Microbial Economics, will highlight diverse strategies adopted by microbes for coping with energy and resource excesses and limitations within a broad spectrum of natural, industrial, and clinical environments. Research areas central to this GRC include terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biogeochemical cycles and the influence of microbes on climate change through consumption and production of greenhouse gases, bioremediation of contaminated land and water, production of biofuels, use as biocatalysts, microbes in human health, and interactions of microbes with animals and plants. Some sessions will embrace ""Microbial Economics"" as it pertains to the cost/benefit of microbes to humans, while others will consider ""Economics"" from the microbe's perspective and explore the diversity of lifestyles and metabolic strategies for coping with resource availability and limitation. The intimate size of the conference encourages dialog and exchange of ideas - especially between students and senior scientists. To help facilitate this, for most sessions a graduate student, postdoctoral researcher or early-career investigator will be selected be selected from the abstract submissions to give a presentation. Poster sessions will also help stimulate discussions that carry through the week. The conference will be preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar subtitled the ""Sharing Economy of Microbes and Microbial Communities: Adaptations and Applications""."

Glass formers may exist as supercooled liquids or glasses, materials that demonstrate unusual and poorly understood behaviors at both the microscopic and macroscopic scales. These materials are ubiquitous in nature and in modern technology, present in window glass, plastics, and medications delivered as pills and tablets. Understanding how molecules move in these systems not only addresses fundamental questions but also enhances understanding of how to stabilize these materials against various types of degradation. The PI develops and uses single molecule imaging approaches to detail the rotations and translations of molecules in these systems, teasing out key time scales and length scales related to molecular motions and relaxations in these environments. <br/><br/>The single molecule imaging experiments in supercooled liquids underway employ newly designed and synthesized ideal probe molecules; these are probes that do not average in space or time over heterogeneities in a glassy host. As a result, these probes directly interrogate length and time scales of interest in these systems and test predictions of theories of the glass transition. The experiments detail dynamic heterogeneity as manifested in relaxation and exchange time distributions of rotational dynamics in both small molecule and polymeric glass formers. In addition, experiments that require sub-diffraction localization are being performed to follow translational dynamics and structural rearrangements in supercooled liquids to resolve questions regarding the poorly understood phenomenon of rotational-translational decoupling. Related techniques employing two types of probes are employed to measure dynamic correlations, allowing identification of length scales of heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. Ideal probe single molecule measurements are also being performed in thin polymeric films, with a focus on identifying the putative surface mobile layer that has practical ramifications for the stability of thin film devices and vapor-deposited glasses. To complement studies of glassy systems prepared through cooling, studies of such systems prepared through swelling are also underway. These studies both detail aspects of dynamic heterogeneity and directly visualize structural rearrangements underlying long time scale relaxations in these systems."

In a boom-bust cycle, communities rich in natural resources experience rapid economic growth when demand spikes, then rapid economic decline when resources are exhausted or demand dissipates. Both trends are often accompanied by increases in crime, infrastructure damage, and environmental degradation, and reduced quality of life. There is little research on how communities use the tools of county and city-level governance - such as public investment, subsidies, taxes, and zoning - to manage societal problems linked to boom-bust cycles and perpetuate positive impacts, such as increases in local employment, after a boom ends. The project identifies governance strategies used by localities in three U.S. states (Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia) affected by the recent shale drilling boom and bust. It examines how community characteristics and local and regional networks of information and resource-sharing among policymaking participants may influence the strategies communities adopt. Finally, it studies how citizens and stakeholders perceive these strategies and which factors encourage communities to deploy more successful governance approaches.<br/> <br/>This project is a mixed-methods investigation of the strategies that local governments pursue to mitigate adverse impacts and leverage positive aspects of the shale drilling boom-bust cycle. By conducting interviews and analyzing survey data with social network and statistical techniques, the research team examines how Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia communities overlaying the Marcellus and Utica Shales have tried to manage the boom-bust cycle. Specifically, the researchers investigate: how pressures from citizens, stakeholders, and government actors affect whether cities and counties adopt boom-bust governance strategies, which strategies they choose, and how strategies diffuse among jurisdictions; whether systematic differences exist between jurisdictions that fail to consider a given approach, fail to adopt it, or adopt it successfully; and how the composition of and strength of ties within local governance networks influence the strategies jurisdictions adopt and how successful citizens, stakeholders, and decision makers view the strategies. The project brings a cross-sectional, quantitative approach to issues typically studied with qualitative, small-n techniques, building theoretical micro-foundations for and testing key assumptions in the policy diffusion and adoption, sustainability, and boom-bust literatures. The research aims to produce actionable insights for communities currently experiencing pernicious boom-bust effects."

In this project, researchers will focus on bacteria in honey bee guts, because gut bacteria affect animals' health. They will study how these bacteria interact with one another, because this is important for how stable helpful gut bacterial communities are, and how they interact with the host animal. The researchers will continue working with two critical bacteria in the bee gut. They have already shown how these bacteria have toxins with which they can attack one another. However, it is likely that these bacteria also help one another in some situations. The researchers will use recently developed methods to look at whether and how these bacteria pass nutrients to one another and to the host bee. This will contribute to understanding how bee-gut bacterial communities stay stable through time. It will help to develop new routes to improving bee health. In addition, during the project graduate and undergraduate researchers will be trained in state-of-the-art methods in microbiology.<br/><br/>As insects can take up and utilize byproducts of carbohydrate fermentation, honeybees may benefit from the metabolic activities of members of their gut microbial communities through both the degradation of toxic sugars and the production of useful byproducts. To better understand the role of cooperative metabolic interactions in gut communities, this project will trace nutrient exchange in the honeybee gut. Genomic evidence suggests that the bee gut microbes Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola depend upon one another for production of nutrients. G. apicola metabolizes carbohydrates that S. alvi cannot, and metabolizes sugars found in nectar that are toxic to honey bees. This project will use isotopically-labeled monosaccharides that can be utilized by G. apicola, but not by S. alvi or the host, to trace metabolic interactions in the bee gut. DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) will be used to track incorporation of labeled carbon atoms into bacterial DNA, while incorporation of these atoms into host tissues will be measured through elemental analysis and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This research will contribute to a greater fundamental understanding of the processes that govern cooperative metabolic interactions among members of the gut microbiota and between the microbiota and the host, and will demonstrate the important potential role of SIP methods in hypothesis testing in microbial community ecology, a framework in which it is uncommonly used."

The project run a large suite of cosmological simulations, targeting galaxies from the faintest dwarfs through the Milky Way, at the ultra-high resolution and realism required to leverage the next-generation of observations. The petascale resources of Blue Waters will allow the project to resolve each galaxy with ~1 billion particles and follow them self-consistently over their entire history in live cosmological settings. These simulations will model the physics of galaxy formation with unprecedented realism, uniquely incorporating not only all of the important stellar feedback mechanisms (radiation pressure, photo-heating, stellar winds, supernovae), but also magnetic fields, physical (anisotropic) Braginskii conduction and viscosity, passive scalar (metal) diffusion, and explicit, multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics. This represents the culmination of several years of work supported by NSF, and will be critical to enable the science of the FIRE project.  The project will support an outreach component involving high school students and teachers, and undergraduate students, as well as a large science team using these simulations. The simulations will be used to make predictions specifically for next-generation observatories including (but not limited to): JWST, LSST, Gaia, and HST, in order to test theories of galaxy and star formation, constrain the origin of the heavy elements in the Universe, the re-ionization history of the early Universe, the effects of fundamental plasma physics in the circum and inter-galactic medium, and the nature of cold dark matter."

Electrochemical engineering is at the hub of a large number of critical industries, including batteries (for applications ranging from load-levelling to transportation to portable devices), semiconductor devices, electrolytic industries (including aluminum and chlorine production and water electrolysis), sensors, and corrosion protection, to name a few. All of these industries depend on well-trained scientists and engineers with electrochemical engineering expertise. However, despite its immense technological importance, electrochemical engineering is taught in relatively few schools, and is not well-recognized by undergraduate students. CWRU is uniquely positioned to host this REU due to its research strength in electrochemical engineering. The intended direct impact of the REU is to increase the number and quality of students that will seek to continue their graduate studies and future employment in the electrochemical technology arena. Additional, broader impact of the REU will include: (a) enhancing human resource development in a STEM area that is of critical importance to many industries but which is largely omitted from the undergraduate curriculum; (b) generating research results that can have an impact on society as a number of the ongoing projects have important practical implications and involve industrial partners; and (c) The REU will offer participants cultural exchange with international visitors in concurrent programs. <br/><br/>CWRU will host 10 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks where they will be introduced to the topic of electrochemical engineering through a coordinated program involving research, lectures, and professional development components. This research will be carried out under the supervision of faculty mentors, who are internationally recognized experts. The research projects are all at the cutting-edge, and are associated with ongoing thrusts in the faculty mentor laboratories.  Applications of the research projects include semiconductor processing, batteries development, biosensors, nanomaterials, and environmental remediation. The research will be complemented by a lecture and workshop series on key topics of electrochemical engineering - thereby enhancing the students' appreciation of the connection of their research to underlying scientific principles. Hands-on workshops in data acquisition and computer simulations will provide the students with broader skills, impacting their research effectiveness and future work. A parallel program in professional development, addressing topics such as communications, paper and proposal writing, ethics, and graduate school application, will contribute significantly to the participants' future career success. A series of visits to industrial companies and technology centers in the electrochemical area will provide a broader perspective of the technology.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."

Briefly, this principle says the sets where a function and its Fourier transform are non-zero cannot be simultaneously small. Stemming from the work of Norbert Wiener in mathematics and Werner Heisenberg in physics, the area of  UP still presents many mathematical challenges. Its problems have a number of applications in adjacent fields. Several classical problems of UP, posed decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov and Norbert Wiener, remain open. Some of such problems are studied in this project. Modern methods of Complex and Harmonic Analysis that appeared in the last 30 years suggest new approaches to the classical challenges of UP. These problems have a number of important applications in Approximation Theory, Prediction Theory, Spectral Theory of differential operators and Mathematical Physics.<br/>  <br/>Among the proposed topics of research are generalizations of the so-called Gap and Type problems in Harmonic Analysis, an extension of the well-known Gelfand-Levitan theory in the area of spectral problems for differential operators and connections between Krein's canonical systems of differential equations and asymptotics of the Riemann zeta-function. Successful completion of this step of the project will create a systematic view of the large variety of problems in the area of UP based on the new notion of Toeplitz Order discussed in the proposal. The study of Toeplitz Order is a continuation of the study of the so-called Toeplitz approach to UP developed in recent papers of Nikolai Makarov (Caltech) and the principal investigator. The next stage of the applications of the Toeplitz approach contains several classical open problems of Harmonic Analysis and Spectral Theory, including general completeness problems, spectral problems for Schroedinger and Dirac operators and a Toeplitz operator version of the so-called Krein - de Branges theory, which was designed to connect Complex and Spectral Analysis.  Among other applications, the project includes a problem on Uncertainty Quantification in the settings of spectral problems for Schroedinger opearators and canonical systems of differential equations."

Inspired by biology, this project embellishes microscopic oil droplets with specific DNA interactions that guide their spontaneous assembly into complex, 3D architectures. These structures range from unusual crystals to helices with exciting optical properties due to their interaction with light. These droplets can readily be solidified, therefore they offer a route to programmable, hands-off manufacturing, with high yield of the desired material. The project aims to explain on a fundamental level the principles of organization that led to life, and this simple model system will be used as an educational tool on the mobile labs of the Biobus, both as an experimental demonstration and as a thought experiment.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The objective of this proposal is to use biological molecules, particularly lipids and DNA strands, to functionalize emulsions in order to self-assemble arbitrarily designed structures, which can readily be solidified. This versatile system allows us to control the fluidity, specificity, valency, and logical programming of interactions between droplets, which in turn facilitates the assembly of complex structures, including emulsion polymers, loops and folded configurations. In this project, we propose 1) to use multiple flavors of DNA grafted on emulsions to program the structure of matter on the micro-scale, 2) to study the folding dynamics of the pathways in search of organizing principles and 3) to use the assembled components for further assembly into large-scale materials. This 'beads-on-a-string' experimental model is analogous to protein folding on the molecular scale, but provides visual access to the chain dynamics as it folds. A major goal of this project is to integrate science education and research within the laboratory and beyond. Apart from training high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students that participate in the research, the PI participates in the World Science Festival and is a founding member of a science education facility called the Biobase, which provides school students from all socioeconomic backgrounds with a research grade microscopy facility for standards-aligned school day field trips and summer camp programs."

In making predictions about epidemics, people consider how and when susceptible and infected hosts come into contact with one another, but they generally do not consider what happens after the parasite gets inside its host. However, the within-host battles between host and parasite could also be important for disease spread. These within-host battles happen because a host's body is constantly resisting and defending against parasites. It is important to consider these dynamics in predicting disease dynamics because not all hosts are equally equipped to fend off parasites and diseases.  Ultimately, hosts that have lower immunity are more likely to allow parasites to spread. In this project, the researcher will focus on populations of an invertebrate that lives in lakes in which they experience large parasite epidemics every year. The researcher will improve our understanding of disease spread by incorporating information about how variability in immunity affects it with host-to-host contact information. The results of this project will help scientists better understand the importance of immune defenses when parasites infect humans, farm animals, and wildlife populations. It will also enable the training of a graduate student, and support projects aimed at encouraging underrepresented minority, female and low-income undergraduate and grade school students to be involved in science.<br/><br/>Our understanding of how ecological and immunological factors interact in natural populations to determine both an individual's probability of infection and the subsequent overall disease prevalence remains limited. Working with a model host-parasite system (Daphnia host and fungal parasite), this research examines the mechanisms underlying immune function, as well as the consequences of variable immunity for parasite transmission. Specifically, the researcher will examine how environmental stressors (e.g. resource quality and availability) shape natural Daphnia populations' mean levels of and variation in immune function. The establishment and spread of the highly virulent parasite within these populations will then be quantified, while tracking each population's levels of exposure and infection success through time. The research relies on tools from multiple disciplines, including ecology, quantitative biology, transcriptomics, and immunology. Moreover, the project integrates theories from disease ecology and ecological immunology to examine disease processes across scales: from the genome, to the individual, to the population and community."

The growth of labor market dualism has become the subject of widespread debate in the scholarly and policy literature, with the existing literature focusing either on formal workers or informal/precarious workers. This project, in contrast, focuses on the interaction between these two groups of workers, providing fresh insights into the institutionalization and limits of polarized employment systems. By conducting a comparative analysis of four industries in post-1987 South Korea with divergent outcomes, this project will help identify the specific conditions facilitating (or impeding) dualism, and assist policymakers in finding solutions to the problems of precarious work and workplace inequality. <br/><br/>This project addresses unanswered questions in the academic debate between the proponents of the ""revitalization"" thesis and the ""dualization"" thesis about the origins and limits of precarious work. The proponents of the revitalization thesis have argued that precarious workers are being empowered by ongoing economic transformations, creating the preconditions for them to organize and make demands for better wages and job security on their own behalf. By contrast, the proponents of the dualization thesis have suggested that micro-corporatist compromises between formal workers and employers have created insurmountable obstacles for the effective self-organization of precarious workers, thereby facilitating the long-term entrenchment of labor dualism.  Through a comparison of four industries--textiles, electronics, automobile and shipbuilding-this project will assess the validity of these two hypotheses. The research conducted for this project will include (1) identifying the divergent patterns of labor dualism in the four industries since 1987; (2) creating and analyzing a new database of protests by formal and precarious workers in these four industries since 1987; and (3) conducting a narrative analysis in order to illuminate the causal mechanisms linking industrial structure, labor dualism, and the agency of both precarious and formal workers."

There is a need for United States residents to establish a deeper understanding of these arenas in order to make informed decisions in an increasingly diverse and complex society.  Likewise, there is a fundamental need for the country to produce college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas who can apply statistics and data science to help provide the Nation with a globally competitive STEM workforce. The investigators on this project will address these needs by designing, developing and evaluating inquiry-based online technology that will simulate current real-world scenarios in statistics and data science to connect students to the importance of the investigative process of problem-solving and data-based decision making and to the skills needed for these activities. In connection with this, the project will take advantage of large, publically available datasets which are now easily accessible to engage students with research-like experiences and technologically interactive educational materials to foster students' abilities in understanding and applying statistics and data science. In addition to materials for students, resources to be developed will be specifically designed to help instructors incorporate key ideas typically not taught in traditional textbooks, such as interactive visualizations, working with messy data, bias, data relevance, reliability, and full research-like experiences involving real-world data. <br/><br/>A key aim of the project is to advance STEM learning through the creation, implementation, and testing of inquiry-based, interactive, online investigative labs that will simulate data-based decision making. Goals of the project include: (1) incorporating research-like experiences for students into their studies; (2) addressing the increased importance of data science and challenging statistical concepts not easily addressed in current courses and textbooks; (3) developing full story line models of real-world scenarios using game-like simulations; and (4) creating and vetting materials that can be incorporated into a variety of traditional introductory and advanced undergraduate courses. The project team's theory of action is built on developing, implementing and assessing each simulation lab and other components of the project according to these goals. An important motivation is to allow students to develop their own research questions, generate and use their own unique data to make decisions, and then observe and learn from the choices made through their interactions with the technology. To evaluate success of the approaches taken, the project will employ a mixed methods approach to compare learning gains from more traditional materials to the gains made with these new materials, evaluate student attitudes and engagement, use data analytics to assess the effectiveness of the components embedded in each lab, and determine best practices for incorporating the resources into a variety of traditional introductory and advanced undergraduate courses.  These fully immersive online game-like labs will be significantly different from other current textbook and online sets of educational materials as each lab will include inquiry-based case studies that contain real-world data analysis complexities, thereby providing a solid introduction to the intellectual content and broad applicability of statistics and data science. In concert with the software lab development, the team will create and vet a new student assessment tool that will be implemented to evaluate students' abilities related to understanding of conceptual connections, communication skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving, as well as their ability to understand and work through challenges emanating from real-world, unstructured datasets. Overall, this project will have significant impact in STEM education by stimulating the power of innovation, creativity, and excitement that occurs within STEM research and applications."

Such technologies have started to unleash a transformation of Web search from a keyword match to discovery, learning, and creativity, which are crucial to promoting the goal of knowledge discovery. Unfortunately, the search for information remains inherently difficult for significant portions of the Web such as the Scholarly Web, which contains many millions of scientific documents. For example, PubMed has over 20 million documents, whereas Google Scholar is estimated to have more than 100 million. Open-access digital libraries such as CiteSeerX, which acquire freely-available research articles from the Web, witness an increase in their document collections as well. Despite attractive advancements by scholarly search portals, semantic search technologies that ""understand"" complex concepts and their relations and can systematically satisfy users' intricate information needs have yet to be investigated on the Scholarly Web.

The approach taken will be to develop an integrated framework, focusing on the extraction and utilization of scholarly knowledge graphs in online scholarly environments. Educationally, this work will involve: training of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, particularly encouraging the participation of women and underrepresented groups in the research efforts; curriculum development and integration of research into courses taught by the PI; exposure of students to industry and international experiences; and education for the general public.<br/> <br/>The project will target the following research objectives: (1) explore the construction of scholarly knowledge graphs that combine evidence from multiple resources in an open information extraction framework; (2) design and develop novel algorithms for the detection and analysis of interesting and previously unknown connections between concepts, in order to enforce knowledge discovery on the Scholarly Web; and (3) investigate the utility of scholarly knowledge graphs in a question answering system.

During illnesses certain cells may not properly perform these tasks.  As appropriate and optimal therapies may vary among patients due to their own genome difference, it would be very helpful to use the patient's own cells to correctly perform their designated tasks.  This could become feasible after the identity of a cell is successfully changed from one type to another by proper genetic programming. Ground-breaking progress was made in this field recently by converting adult skin cells into other desirable cell types. Such cell reprogramming methods are more acceptable because the cells that are modified come from the patient and the changes cannot be transmitted to others or to offspring.  Unfortunately, current delivery tools for cell reprogramming are very slow and too inefficient to use in therapy. This award investigates a new microfluidic approach to synthesize and manufacture novel polymeric nanoparticles for efficient gene delivery. With its continuous flow operation, this novel approach produces such gene carriers in large quantities and at low cost. Moreover, the high-quality nanoparticles that are generated could significantly increase the success rate of cell reprogramming to produce desired types of a patient's cells with high yield.  Its nanomanufacturing potential could accelerate future clinical and pharmaceutical uses of such patient-matched cells. This research will also train graduate students in multidisciplinary skills in science and engineering. The results will be integrated into engineering courses to inspire, educate, and retain undergraduate and minority students through hands-on opportunities in bio- and nanomanufacturing, cell therapy, chemistry, characterization, and process development. <br/><br/>Although sustained cell reprogramming is feasible, the low success rate is tied to its transient transfection behavior, namely, poor delivery efficiency of the key transcription factors and low cell survival to allow for repeated delivery, and the lack of appropriate manufacturing process in the production of desired gene carriers and reprogrammed cells. This research project studies a hybrid field microfluidic process to produce homogeneous polyplex nanoparticles for better protection, condensation, and release of genetic probes by limiting the complexation at the fluid interface. Gold nanoparticle carriers help fix the internalized polymer molecules after the dissociation of the polyplex to reduce cytotoxicity.  In addition, electroporation treatment promotes transport of genetic material to the nucleus. The combination ensures increased delivery efficiency and the allowance for repeated transfection to sustain the expression of the needed reprogramming factors. The hybrid microfluidic system?s flow operation allows continuous production of gene carriers and later patient-matched cell lines with high throughput and good quality control. The project's success provides not only a powerful manufacturing route in nanoprobe synthesis, but also an effective tool for potential synergy of diagnosis and therapeutics to advance current gene/drug delivery and cell-based bio-manufacturing processes."

Giant pandas rely on chemical cues in order to communicate identity, kinship, and reproductive status to other individuals. However, limited information exists on the ability of giant pandas to communicate across a fragmented landscape. Therefore, this study will collect compounds from the air throughout the natural environment and analyze these components to assess individual movement, habitat use, and communication across fragmented habitats. This research will be conducted in the Sichuan province of China under the mentorship of Dr. Zhang Zejun at China West Normal University. Dr. Zhang Zejun not only offers expert knowledge regarding giant panda reproduction and habitat use, but also provides access to field locations, cameras, and analytical equipment required to implement this study. This research will develop a novel tool that will potentially connect isolated populations and contribute to conservation efforts of this iconic species.  <br/><br/>The elusive giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) utilizes volatile chemical cues to determine identity, gender, and sexual receptivity of conspecifics across fragmented habitats. With isolated populations still at risk for extinction, this study aims to identify unique volatile chemical profiles detectable in air that vary with distribution and habitat in free-ranging giant pandas. Field air analysis and solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) will be used to collect volatile compounds from free-ranging giant pandas occupying the Sichuan province of China. In collaboration with Dr. Zhang Zejun at China West Normal University, volatile compounds will be captured from the environment by securing SPME fibers along known giant panda routes and scent-marking stations. Extracted volatile compounds will be analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry in order to determine differences in the volatile air profile relative to identity, gender, and site location. This research will provide valuable knowledge of giant panda population dynamics and communication across a fragmented landscape. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. Graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop new methods to study the long term behavior of dynamical systems in a theoretical setting and to explore applications to the mathematical subject of combinatorics.<br/><br/>Inspired by Furstenberg's proof of Szemeredi's theorem using ergodic theory in 1977, several results in Ramsey theory and combinatorial number theory were since obtained using ideas and methods from dynamical systems. The interplay with combinatorics has likewise enriched the fields of ergodic theory and topological dynamics with a wealth of interesting new problems. The two main research directions of this project are:<br/>1. To develop new techniques within the framework of dynamical systems to solve Ramsey theoretic problems, with emphasis on those concerning partition regularity of (systems of) non-linear equations.<br/>2. To improve the understanding of the long term behaviour of measure preserving systems by exploring the phenomena of multiple recurrence and convergence of  multiple ergodic averages along polynomials and other natural classes of sequences."

Modern mammals chew in a distinctive sideways pattern that is an important part of their adaptation to high metabolism lifestyles. Mammals of the early Cenozoic era, which began about 65 million years ago, may have had a wider variety of adaptations, potentially including heavy reliance on vertical chewing, as seen in most reptiles. This may have accompanied an arrangement of the cusps of the teeth such that they would wear rapidly into flat crushing surfaces. Alternatively, heavy, planar wear on the teeth of some early Cenozoic mammals may represent a constraint on their ability to evolve solutions to resist wear caused during a normal chewing sequence by grit adhering to food. Because mammals must bring their teeth together into a stereotyped fit during occlusion, the shapes of the teeth can be used to predict the path of the two teeth as they come into alignment, and thus test these alternate hypotheses. Dr. Alistair Evans, the project host at Monash University, is a world expert in the use of digital models to reconstruct chewing path in this manner.<br/><br/>Fossil material of the species under study, Aphronorus orieli, comes from the Paleocene Bangtail Formation of Montana. It includes a complete, occluding jaw and cranium and miscellaneous upper and lower dental material that will be used to supplement the reconstruction as needed. A. orieli is a member of the Family Pentacodontidae, which may be related to living pangolins. The occlusal path of A. orieli will be reconstructed from digital models of the upper and lower dentition and compared to the treeshrew Ptilocercus lowii. P. lowii is a generalized insectivore similar in body size to A. orieli whose chewing behavior can be inferred to occur in a transverse path a priori from studies of its close relatives in the genus Tupaia. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.

The current mass production of graphene is focused on two-dimensional graphene sheets. However, the attractive forces between graphene sheets can cause two-dimensional graphene to restack into graphite-like powders, decreasing their specific surface area and deteriorating graphene's unique properties. Three-dimensional graphene, which is a graphene sheet that possesses a curved non-planar shape can inhibit the restacking. This award advances knowledge in scalable nano-scale processing of three-dimensional shape-controlled graphene. In this process, three-dimensional graphene sheets are produced from the exothermic reaction of carbon monoxide and alkali metal oxides, followed by an acid treatment. The three-dimensional graphene are explored as materials for energy devices. Project plans are to have a strong impact on education and outreach by inspiring to engage Native American students in science and engineering. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project receive advanced training, which will build a firm foundation for their future careers.<br/><br/>Current techniques for three-dimensional (3D) graphene synthesis are limited by the difficulty of controlling graphene shapes and the requirement for high energy need. To overcome these limits, a scalable process is investigated based on a previously invented method involving a reaction between CO and alkali metal oxides. In this approach, graphene sheets are formed simultaneously with alkali metal carbonate nano-particles. Consequently, the generated carbonate nano-particles do not only play a role in determining the locally curved shape of the 3D graphene sheets, but also isolate the graphene sheets from each other to prevent graphite formation during synthesis. After removing the carbonate nano-particles with acid, 3D shape-controlled graphene sheets are obtained. The specific aims of this research are to synthesize various controlled shapes, understand the kinetics of reactions for 3D graphene production, evaluate structure-property relationships, and explore the 3D graphene sheets as electrode materials for solar cells, ion batteries, and supercapacitors. This research advances a new concept in the synthesis of 3D graphene. It involves the understanding of fundamental chemistry, physics, and material science at nanoscale. Furthermore, the resulting kinetic relationships provide a scientific and engineering basis to scale-up the manufacturing process for commercialization."

Partial differential equations and several complex variables are employed in string theory and twistor theory, physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields.  The existence and regularity of solutions to such partial differential equations are still not fully understood, and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematical analysis.  The current study is not only important for the development of mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena as well, with potential applications in other sciences and technology.  <br/><br/>This research focuses on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.

Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is a challenging and important problem.  New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups.  The study of several complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics, algebraic and complex geometry.

Despite the trend towards urbanization, little is known about the influence of urban environments on the evolution and ecology of many animals. In Europe, a gene has been found to vary between urban and rural birds. This gene encodes a protein that transports an important hormone in and out of cells. This variation is thought to help birds cope differently with stress in urban settings by influencing mood and behavior. However, a major question remains, does this genetic variation consistently correspond to urbanization across species and around the world?  This research will explore how this gene varies in different bird species inside and outside cities in the Pacific coast of the US and western Amazon of Peru.  Examining the genetic differences in a diversity of birds in different locations will give us general insight into how urbanization affects bird evolution. This urban focused research will make biological science more relevant to human residents and will inform the way cities grow by recognizing that we share these landscapes with wildlife. In addition, this international research will promote scientific exchange between Peru and the US.    <br/><br/>This research will focus on genetic markers associated with a serotonin transporter. To understand the background genetic diversity in these markers, the researchers will first characterize the variation at a biogeographic scale. They will do this by taking tissue samples from natural history museum collections representing the full range of six focal species and sequencing the DNA in the relevant marker regions. Then, along with local scientists in Peru, the researchers will catch birds of the same six species in two large cities, two small cities, and two rural/natural areas. The same genetic markers will be sequenced and variation between the study sites and the larger biogeographic patterns will be assessed. Because a multi-species, multi-environment, comparative approach has not been carried out before, any pattern in the results with inform our understanding of genetic diversity in the tropics and its role in resilience against urbanization. If the patterns at a fine spatial scale are consistent with those at a large spatial scale, it will show that, unlike in Europe, urbanization has not had an important effect on the distribution of alleles of this gene in these species. If the serotonin transporter genetic diversity is different at a fine spatial scale rather than a large spatial scale, while neutral genetic markers show the same patterns of diversity at fine and large spatial scales, it will indicate that this gene has perhaps been under selection associated with urbanization. If all genetic markers show differences at fine spatial scales from large spatial scales, further investigation will be needed to tease apart the roles of ecology and species selection in urban areas, making this project a valuable first foray into a case of rapid adaptive evolution in a novel environment.<br/> "

When such languages lack a writing system and the remaining speakers are elderly, they are especially susceptible to erosion and loss. In situations such as these, there is an urgent need to document and analyze the languages while there are still fluent speakers. This work not only preserves the language for its speakers but also produces language data that can advance theoretical linguistics and typological studies. This project will document one of the least known languages in a highly diverse linguistic region. The importance of this project lies in its ability to understand the genetic relationships between languages, its potential to deepen the linguistic understanding of grammatical features poorly understood in the world's languages, and to better understand the historical development of a language family. Broader impacts include fostering an international scientific partnership in a geopolitically significant part of the world. Such documentation efforts support the national interest by facilitating soft diplomacy through the scientific training of international colleagues. Another broader impact is the potential to test and transform the technology of documentation at a distance, expanding the tools available to linguists for documenting languages where travel is restricted or otherwise challenging. Areas of dense linguistic diversity often lie in remote regions, so innovations in field methods could enable high quality documentation of more languages than is currently possible. The project will also expand the language documentation capabilities of the local university partner, setting the stage for future documentation projects in this particular linguistically diverse region.<br/><br/>This project will document and analyze Domaaki, a highly endangered and underdocumented Indo-Aryan language spoken in only two villages in northern Pakistan. This region, and the nearby region of India, is estimated to have around 50 distinct languages from six different language families. The project brings together a team of linguists from the U.S. and Pakistan, building on an existing partnership between San José State University and the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The momentum of this partnership, started through a U.S. State Department program, will enable the creation of a publicly-accessible digital corpus of the language. The corpus will consist of audio and video recordings from speakers in both villages in a variety of contexts, such as ceremonies, folk stories, spontaneous conversation and songs. The recordings will be transcribed, annotated and translated into English and Urdu, which will allow for in-depth analysis of Domaaki's grammatical structures. Although much is yet to be learned about the language, constructions involving aspectual auxiliaries, split ergativity and switch-reference converbs will be rich areas of scientific investigation, especially with regard to how they are used in spontaneous discourse. These data will shed further light on the Indo-Aryan family and Domaaki's place within it, including its similarity to close relative Romani.

In recent decades snowfall has declined across many parts of the northern United States and this decline is expected to continue into the future. This study focuses on how small mammals that live at the interface between the snow and the soil respond to the loss of this habitat. While deep snow allows small mammals, such as mice or voles, to hide from predators, these animals may benefit from leaving snow covered areas to search for food (seeds and seedlings). This study will remove snow in a small area to determine whether less snow leads small mammals to spend more time foraging and being susceptible to predators. Cameras will be used to record changes in the behavior of the small mammals.  Seeds and seedlings will be monitored to determine how the changes in mammal behavior influence their survival. Understanding conditions that promote small mammal activity in areas with little snow could help in predicting seedling survival in future decades, ultimately leading to more effective forest management strategies. This study will support the training of a graduate and undergraduate student and will provide opportunities for outreach with K-12 students and with the general public. <br/><br/>This research examines the importance of snow depth and predation risk on small mammal activity and seed predation in a northern temperate forest. The researchers will conduct an experiment that manipulates the predation refuge provided by the interface between the soil and snow (subnivium), and an alternative predation refuge (woody debris) from which most snow has been removed. Using a recently described technique, motion-sensor infrared cameras will be placed in each treatment combination to compare small mammal activity in areas with deep snow and shallow snow. Cameras will be focused on trays containing seeds and seedlings of four native tree species, allowing researchers to quantify how changes in small mammal activity can influence the relative survival rates of the plant species they consume. By combining camera traps in the subnivium with a seed removal assay, researchers will also be able to monitor the small mammal species consuming seeds. This research will help clarify the trade-offs small mammals face between foraging efficiency and predation risk during winter, providing a more thorough understanding of how environmental context might alter the relationship between snow depth, and small mammals and the seeds they consume."

The goal of this research is to improve our knowledge of how these events change the probability of future large earthquakes in New Zealand. The results may be applicable to a similar region on the west coast of the U.S. New Zealand is an excellent study site because it has known SSEs, a dense network of GPS stations used to study SSEs, and world experts in the field. Another goal is to further engage the public with earthquake science to eliminate barriers between scientific research and the public. Public understanding of earthquake hazards is the first step in saving lives and reducing response time of local rescue authorities.

First we will place bounds on the size of earthquake events in New Zealand. Then we will use delayed failure models to study how the stress from SSEs changes large earthquake probabilities in a time-dependent sense.  By utilizing these two separate techniques of moment-bounding and estimation of time-dependent large earthquake probabilities, we hope to develop a systematic way to relate SSEs to large earthquakes, especially in areas where extraordinarily large earthquakes are plausible.<br/><br/>This project funds a new research collaboration between a U.S. Graduate student, Ryan Yohler, and a prominent earthquake scientist, Dr. Laura Wallace, and her colleagues at GNS Science in New Zealand, jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand."

While the use of randomness in computer science is ubiquitous, many important computational and algorithmic problems remain to be studied using this foundational concept. Despite the complexity of many theoretic as well as practical modern algorithms, randomness is frequently able to remedy the worst-case examples focusing on the average case examples and randomized algorithms which make use of local information. This includes such intensively studied problems as the so-called Travelling Salesperson problem, by concentrating on geometric versions where efficient algorithms are feasible. An important aspect of the project is the involvement of students in the research, which is expected to have a broad impact on mathematics and on computer science beyond the theoretical foundations of the project.<br/><br/>A special focus of this project is to identify problems that involve random walks on graphs and digraphs. Based on significant recent progress, a thorough investigation of so-called hashing schemes will be undertaken, examining search algorithms on graphs that employ only local information. The classical random walk is a prime example of such an algorithm. The current available analysis for preferential attachment graphs, which are connected to random models of the world-wide web, will be extended to more general models of graphs. A statistical test has been devised for detecting bias in a sample claiming to be from the steady state of a Markov chain. Another line of research is on-line purchasing problems. In such problems, the edges of a graph are given random costs and are presented sequentially and they must be selected or rejected. The accepted edges are used to build a structure, and the goal is to build this structure as economically as possible."

The carbon-hydrogen single bond (C-H) and carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) are two of the most common chemical bonds in organic compounds and represent convenient locations to introduce new functionality into those compounds. However, it is difficult to achieve a desired reaction at only one specific C-H or C=C bond of the many that are present in a single molecule. In this project, Dr. Schomaker is developing new silver catalysts that transform these bonds to important and useful carbon-nitrogen bonds with high yields, less waste, and with the ability to selectively make many different useful products from a single starting compound.  Studies to understand the unique features of silver that enable such high, predictable levels of control over this reactivity are key to designing improved and durable catalysts that efficiently transform precious hydrocarbon feedstocks into valuable materials, even using water as reaction solvent.  Dr. Schomaker is active in outreach programs related to her research interests in catalysis to educate and engage the general public, especially young women, in fields related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Her activities include developing hands-on experimental modules centered on topics related to silver catalysis for ""Expanding Your Horizons"", a STEM-centered program for girls in 6-8th grades, as well as entertaining and educational demonstrations on silver chemistry for ""Science is Fun"" public presentations.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jennifer Schomaker of the University of Wisconsin is developing low-cost, modular catalysts for the tunable functionalization of C-H bonds to valuable C-N bonds. Such methods are crucial for streamlined syntheses of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, chiral ligands and amine building blocks, but represent a long-standing challenge in the field of catalysis. To address this issue, Dr. Schomaker is pursuing a fundamental understanding of the unique features of silver complexes that enable them to achieve catalyst-controlled transformations of C-H bonds to C-N bonds through metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer processes. A combination of variable temperature (VT) NMR, diffusion spectroscopy, mechanistic and computational studies (density functional theory and higher-level ab initio methods such as CASSCF) are being employed to assess how the features of N-donor ligands influence the electronic structure of the metal nitrene, the dynamic/fluxional behavior of reactive intermediates in solution and promotion of non-covalent interactions between substrate/catalyst to influence the site of the C-H functionalization event. Ultimately, this work is establishing universal design principles for the synthesis of catalysts that facilitate non-directed C-H functionalizations capable of overriding innate reactivity preferences that are extendable to other metals and other C-H oxidation reactions, particularly in an asymmetric context. Dr. Schomaker is also active in a number of STEM outreach programs to engage and educate students in her community about the importance of catalysis in solving challenges that currently face our society. She is particularly interested in increasing the representation of women in STEM disciplines to support the broader impacts of this work."

The project will use a number of different approaches to assess the ways in which the presence and locational arrangement of fueling and charging networks influences consumer willingness to purchase or lease alternative-fuel vehicles that operate with liquid biofuels, compressed natural gas, electricity, or hydrogen.  The project will provide new insights because it will move beyond previous studies that focused on the distance from home of a single hypothetical station or the percentage of gasoline stations that offer an alternative fuel and study how prospective adopters evaluate the geographic arrangement of a station network.  The project will consider the different dynamics of different kinds of fuel systems, moving beyond previous emphasis on slow-charging electric vehicles by giving greater attention to the more rapid recharging of newer electric vehicles and refueling of fast-filling hydrogen or natural gas vehicles.  In addition to focusing on this specific problem, the project's spatial-analytic approaches will be adaptable for use in examining other types of facilities besides fuel stations.  The project will help address a major barrier to consumer adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles: the lack of conveniently located fuel stations.  Project findings will contribute to planning more efficient and effective station networks, thereby facilitating the use of such vehicles and enabling them to serve as a more viable complement to other modes of transportation.<br/><br/>The investigators will use four different approaches to explore answers to the project's overarching research question:  How do prospective buyers assess the geographic arrangement of alternative fuel stations?  They will conduct an online survey of owners of compressed natural-gas vehicles in Southern California to gather information regarding where those drivers lived, worked, and refueled at the time they purchased their vehicles.  This study will reveal whether buyers were more likely to rely on a station near home when they purchased the vehicle and whether they adapted over time by switching to a station farther from home but along frequently traveled routes.  In a second study, the investigators will ask potential fuel-cell vehicle adopters in Connecticut to provide feedback regarding how maps of different refueling station networks affect their decisions to purchase a fuel-cell vehicle, thereby helping identify which criteria may be most influential among a range of options generated by optimal station location models.  In a third study, the investigators will conduct interviews with potential customers of fuel-cell vehicles in California in order to develop an ethnographic decision-tree model of the consumer decision-making process.  In the fourth study, the investigators will engage consumers and industry stakeholders in planning a network of refueling stations using a geodesign process that enables them to use geographic information systems in hands-on workshops to develop spatial plans.  By employing four different methods in three different regions for different types of vehicles, the project will enable the investigators to approach a complex issue from various angles to produce a deeper understanding of how to arrange stations to best promote adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles."

Rising ocean temperatures, coral bleaching and overfishing threaten coastal ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. This project focuses on a case study carried out in the Solomon Islands where the Solomon Islands Fishery Management Act is assessed for its potential to increase the ability of their coastal communities to adapt to currently occurring environmental changes. The Solomon Islands are impacted by rising ocean temperature and increasingly frequent coral bleaching, which are compounded by overfishing and coastal development. The resulting loss of marine resources threatens coastal ecosystems and the communities that rely on them. Flexible forms of marine governance are needed to ensure that stakeholders and decision-makers are able to adapt to these effects. Previous research suggests that engaging communities, and creating space for shared learning between managers, researchers, and local people, are important components of a flexible governance system. This project will use policy analysis and interviews with regional experts to assess the potential of the fisheries act to create such a system. This research will be conducted at Australia National University (ANU) with Dr. Lorrae van Kerkhoff, a noted knowledge governance researcher. Canberra is a hub for Pacific island research, making it ideal for interviews with fisheries governance professionals. The results of this work will be relevant to the Oceania region and to U.S. Pacific islands facing similar threats.<br/><br/>This project applies environmental governance as a lens to evaluate the Solomon Islands Fishery Management Act as a potential example of emerging adaptive governance. Specific attention will be given to the potential for this act to foster knowledge coproduction between stakeholders in the Solomon Islands. Adaptive governance has been proposed as a system well-suited to the complexity of rapidly changing social-ecological systems. Little is known about how adaptive governance integrates with existent knowledge systems, especially those of Pacific Island communities. This study employs a deductive policy analysis and semi-structured interviews with Pacific fisheries policy experts to better understand how adaptive governance may create space for knowledge coproduction and transmission between indigenous systems and Western science.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

The second component will develop, and run on Blue Waters, the new code SpECTRE for numerical relativity simulations with matter and radiation.  SpECTRE uses Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. It is designed for high accuracy and high scalability on current and future supercomputers by following a novel task-based parallelization paradigm.  SpECTRE's initial version already implements general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.  It will be upgraded to handle the dynamical spacetimes of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers and stellar collapse, including nuclear-theory based hot equations of state and neutrinos.

Similar interactions are responsible for creating many other interesting objects, including the Type 1a supernovae we use to measure the expansion of the universe. To better understand these processes, astronomers need reliable measurements of the mass and internal structure of mass-transfer and collision products like blue stragglers. Such measurements only recently became possible using a new technique called asteroseismology. Similar to seismologists using earthquakes to study the interior of the Earth, astronomers use seismic waves that propagate inside stars to probe their interior structures. These wave patterns can be detected as small variations in a star's brightness. NASA's Kepler mission has monitored the brightness of thousands of stars for four years, providing a groundbreaking data set to study these seismic waves. This project will study a sample of blue stragglers observed by Kepler, using their seismic wave patterns to determine their masses, rotation rates, and internal structures. This research will be done in collaboration with Dr. Dennis Stello at the University of New South Wales, one of a handful of experts on asteroseismology in the world. <br/><br/>Two key uncertainties in the physics of collisions and binary mass transfer are the mass transfer efficiency and the angular momentum evolution. In combination with detailed stellar modeling, asteroseismology can shed light on mass transfer efficiency by providing precise mass measurements of blue stragglers, a constraint that has been largely unavailable to modelers. Some blue stragglers display mixed p- and g- mode oscillations, allowing separate measurements of core and envelope properties. For this project, measuring a core and an envelope rotation rate will illuminate how much angular momentum is accreted at the blue straggler surface, and if it is transported down into the stellar core. This technique has already offered many insights into angular momentum transport in normal stars. This project will be one of the first efforts to measure these properties in non-standard stars like blue stragglers, and promises to offer more insight into the angular momentum evolution of mass-transfer and collision products. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

This theoretical instrument is a geometric count that describes the degree of instability of traveling waves and other more complicated patterns found in solutions of partial differential equations. It draws upon a broad array of tools, including spectral and perturbation theories, symplectic geometry, and Hamiltonian dynamics. While the Maslov index was originally introduced in an abstract area of mathematics, one of the major objectives of the current project is to demonstrate its fundamental importance in many unresolved and more applied problems. This approach can be used to study equations describing the combustion of solid fuels and the interaction of several chemical reactants evolving in time, as well as the stability of a regularized version of equations describing ideal incompressible fluids that has continued to challenge researches for more than three centuries.<br/><br/>Stability and instability of nonlinear waves and other patterns for multidimensional reaction diffusion and other partial differential equations, and the study of dynamics near these special solutions, are cornerstone issues at the crossroads of contemporary applied dynamical systems, partial differential equations, spectral theory of non-selfadjoint operators, and infinite dimensional symplectic geometry. The aim of this project is to develop and apply new methods in spectral theory of multidimensional differential operators, and address nonlinear stability for models in applied combustion theory, as well as general gradient systems of reaction diffusion equations, and many others. The project is built on a theoretical breakthrough recently achieved in these areas in computing the Morse index via the Maslov index. The Morse index counts the number of unstable eigenvalues of the linearization about the pattern, while the Maslov index is an invariant from symplectic geometry that counts the signed number of intersections of paths in the space of infinite dimensional Lagrangian planes. The principal investigator and his colleagues aim to to further develop the Maslov index approach by proving new Hadamard-type formulas for the derivatives of the eigenvalues and new spectral flow formulas for families of the differential operators obtained by linearizing partial differential equations about the traveling waves. The Maslov index calculations are being utilized in several open problems in applied dynamical systems: the gradient conjecture on Turing's patterns, the computation of spectra of nonlinear pencils, and the periodic problems for nonlinear Schrodinger equations. An important part of the project is the study of the multidimensional nonlinear stability of planar fronts for reaction diffusion systems arising in combustion theory of solid fuels and in modeling of exothermic and endothermic chemical reactions."

This project will advance knowledge in the design of interest triggers for science in immersive digital simulation learning games. When learners are interested in a topic, it can have a profound impact on the quality of their learning. Although much is known about how informal learning experiences can promote interest in STEM, much less research has addressed links between technology use and interest development. This Exploratory Pathways project will investigate (1) the impact of entertainment technology use by middle school learners on STEM interest development, (2) the design of interactive educational technologies created specifically to trigger interest in astronomy, and (3) informal learning resources for sustained interaction with STEM content over time. In particular, learners will have the opportunity to interactively explore the scientific consequences of considering alternative versions of Earth via ""What if?"" questions, such as ""What if the earth had no moon?"" or ""What if the earth were twice its current size?"". While using the simulations, learners will be invited to make observations and propose scientific explanations for what they see as different. Given recent discoveries of potentially habitable worlds throughout the Galaxy, such questions have high relevance to public discourse around space exploration, conditions necessary for life, and the long-term future of the human race. Studies will occur across three informal learning settings: museum exhibits, afterschool programs, and summer camps, and are driven by the following research questions: What technology-based triggers of interest have the strongest influence on interest? Which contextual factors are most important for supporting long-term interest development? And, what kinds of technology-based triggers are most effective for learners from audiences who are underrepresented in STEM? This research will result in an empirically tested approach for cultivating interest that will allow educators to leverage the ""What if?"" pedagogy in their own work, as well as downloadable materials suitable for use in both informal and formal learning settings. <br/><br/>Planned studies will identify features that are effective in triggering interest, with an emphasis on groups underrepresented in STEM, and elaborate on the importance of engaging learners in explanatory dialogues and in service of interest development. It is hypothesized that interacting in such novel ways can act as a trigger for interest in astronomy, physics, and potentially other areas of STEM. Design iterations will also investigate different forms of learning supports, such as guidance from facilitators, collaboration, and automated guidance available within the simulations, and identify how features vary with respect to learning contexts. Data collected will include interview and survey data to track interest development, measures of knowledge in astronomy and physics, and log files of simulation use to better understand how behaviors in the simulations align with stated interests. Results of the studies will advance the theoretical understanding of interest development and its relationship to interactive experiences, and will also have practical implications for the deployment of technology in informal settings by identifying features critical for triggering the interest of middle school learners. This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants."

In particular the principal investigator plans to: 1) construct  q-hypergeometric solutions of the equivariant quantum differential equation for the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety; 2) identify the quantum cohomology algebra of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with the algebra of functions on the critical set of the associated hypergeometric (or q-hypergeometric) master function; 3). use hypergeometric solutions of qKZB equations to define an action of elliptic dynamical quantum groups on elliptic equivariant cohomology of partial flag varieties; 4) find a potential for a KZ-type connection and a Frobenius-like structure on the base of the KZ-type connections; 5) develop a relation between the critical set of master functions associated with an affine Lie algebra and classical integrable hierarchies associated with that Lie algebra; 6) construct hypergeometric solutions of cyclotomic KZ equations in terms of cyclotomic discriminantal arrangements; 7) use the folding relation between the Lie algebras of certain types to geometrize a type of Bethe algebra."

The research will address a central paradox in sociological research about how information technology is changing society: while the internet is a force of liberation, e.g. because it helps people organize social activities across time and distance at low cost, the same communication technology extends existing power structures, e.g. through large-scale surveillance of dissenting citizens. By studying clashes between these two forces--in this case represented by internet-mediated crime on the one hand and law enforcement operations on the other--the project explores the unintended consequences of social control work in the digital age, as targeted groups struggle to overcome the efforts to halt them. Investigating the consequences of long-standing criminal justice methods in digital markets for banned goods and services will inform the ongoing debate on drug policy reform, and more broadly, expand the knowledge of the policing of social behavior. The proposed project will advance research on illegal markets ? directly through the undertaken research, and indirectly by making all quantitative data on trade patterns publicly available for other researchers. <br/><br/>In 2014, the Co-PI interviewed a British man who had been running a ""largeish"" drug dealing operation for ""quite a few years"", specializing in opium and cannabis. A recent shift to e-commerce had transformed his business. ""Our goals are different [now]."" In digital markets, ""you can make structured plans, attainable goals, you can expand in a controlled manner."" Another interviewee said he had no prior experience with drug trade before he started vending online. He explained at the time that he has no face-to-face interaction with customers or suppliers--he produces his chemical drugs in his home kitchen, processes all orders through the internet, and sends his meticulously packed products by conventional postal services. His plan is to remain strictly digital, he said. ""I have no contact with any milieu where I can sell my products, outside of the internet. I have no desire to risk exposure in milieus the police might know of."" The two vendors were active in a market that has since been shut down by law enforcement, but both continued to do business in other markets. This project asks, how is digital trade of illegal goods and services organized, and how are market actors adapting to law enforcement?s efforts to stop them? Drawing on quantitative data collected from digital markets for banned goods and services, the research details how the markets successfully organize trade on a scale that was, until recently, only possible for criminal syndicates with access to military, political and economic capital, and how the trade continued after several law enforcement crackdowns. To explain why and how vendors and customers continued their banned activities in the face of law enforcement, interviews with customers and vendors will be conducted."

They can result when new strains of a pathogen arise, or from a pathogen being introduced into a new area, and can threaten wildlife, livestock, and humans through illness and death. Because most emerging infectious diseases that shift to humans come from wildlife it is important to understand wildlife diseases. Often, scientists use mathematical models of disease as tools to understand existing patterns of how a disease spreads or to help predict future trends. This research focuses on understanding differences among hosts in how they behave, or how their bodies respond to infection affect the next step in a disease epidemic: when the pathogen spreads among hosts. This research will help scientists better understand how individual differences in what happens after infection should be incorporated into disease models. With this information, scientists and managers will be able to better design data collection and disease models for the targeted control of emerging infectious diseases. The project will also train a graduate student and result in the development of new teaching tools for grade school and undergraduate students, including a website that could be used at many other colleges and universities.<br/><br/><br/>Given the potential for severe consequences of emerging infections diseases with wildlife sources and the time and resource-intensive nature of gathering pathogen data in wildlife populations, improved disease models are necessary tools for providing insight into the research effort necessary to capture the transmission process. The objective of this research is to link empirical and modeling approaches to better understand how among-host variation in traits affects pathogen transmission in a wildlife system. It will integrate a theoretical model with empirical data from the host-pathogen system of house finches and their bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum. This work will address how the behavioral and physiological phenotypes affect disease dynamics and will also explore the effects of infection-induced behavioral changes. Experimental M. gallisepticum infection data combined with empirical contact network data will be used to parameterize a dynamic network disease model. This research will provide novel insights into the potential role of covariation between behavioral and immune competence in epidemic dynamics, and will serve as one of the first models to apply dynamic networks to an emerging infectious disease system in wildlife."

The exact mechanisms linking ocean circulation to ice sheet variability can be difficult to tease out using modern observations alone. Geologists therefore look to the past for examples of when ocean circulation changed and how those changes relate to other phenomena in past eras. In particular, it has been found that the circulation of Antarctic Bottom Water, dense water that sinks around the Antarctic continent and fills the deepest parts of the world?'s ocean, may have a very intimate link with melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The concentration of naturally-occurring uranium in Southern Ocean sediments, formed under low oxygen conditions, is a key tool that has been applied to reconstruct past circulation changes during one past warm period, ~125,000 years ago, in one area of the Southern Ocean.  This project will apply this recently developed method to other areas of the Southern Ocean and to other time periods in the past (up to 500,000 years ago) in order to investigate a more robust mechanism for how circulation around Antarctica is linked to ice sheet melting and how this might change in the future.  The project supports an early-career researcher as well the training of a graduate and undergraduate students in the research.  Outreach will be accomplished through the development of a new course and with high school students through events such as the Ocean Sciences Bowl competition. The project will contribute to infrastructure by developing a new proxy for paleoceanography, which has the potential to better constrain models of ice sheet melting and inform on issues related to climate change and sea level rise.<br/><br/>To more accurately reconstruct past deep Southern Ocean oxygenation conditions, and therefore Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) circulation, the project will utilize a novel geochemical approach using the isotope composition of authigenic uranium (U-234/U-238), augmented by other redox sensitive metals (Re and Mn). This combination of measurements allows for periods of changing oxidation to be identified that elemental proxies alone could not detect. This approach will be applied in multiple Southern Ocean cores to test for reproducibility and sensitivity to varying sedimentary environments. Furthermore, the project will investigate multiple interglacial periods over the past 500,000 years to examine the response of AABW across a range of forcings and Antarctic Ice sheet extents. The result will be a robust perspective on AABW variability during interglacial periods and its relationship to external forcings (orbital configuration, CO2, Southern Ocean productivity) and West Antarctic Ice Sheet melting."

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative algebras, which are mathematical objects that have operations of addition and multiplication; however, the multiplication may not be commutative: xy does not have to equal yx. The purpose of the project is to investigate a set of mathematical problems motivated by physics. More specifically, the motivation derives from a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research promotes further interaction between these fields. The project provides excellent opportunities for the investigator to work with young scientists and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other countries to promote scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry, one studies geometry via algebras of functions on noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative associative algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra.  An important class of noncommutative manifolds can be obtained as deformations of commutative algebras.  The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different.  Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. This project will focus on the study of homotopy algebra structures in noncommutative geometry using tools from deformation quantization and Lie groupoid and Lie algebroid theory.  The problems include exploring the Duflo and Todd type class, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem, and studying Tsygan noncommutative calculi in a general framework in terms of Lie algebroids."

Additionally, national surveys show that sleep is poorly understood among the general public and that many Americans, particularly students, are extremely sleep deprived.  Therefore, this project integrates a series of research and educational goals to impact our understanding of the brain mechanisms that control mammalian sleep.  The PI will manipulate two populations of neurons (called AgRP neurons and POMC neurons) in rodent brains using powerful genetic technologies to determine their roles in regulating sleep/wake behavior.  These groups of neurons are well-known for sensing the nutritional and caloric needs of the body, and so our research will study how food intake affects states of sleep and wakefulness. This work will thus increase our understanding of how the brain coordinates complex behavioral states, in this case hunger and sleep.  The educational goals will broaden the impact of this project by including undergraduates in all aspects of this research and by implementing a new course at Williams College on the science of sleep.  This course will produce educational materials on sleep that will be freely available and distributed. Together, the research and educational components of this award will increase the United States' competitiveness in science and technology, particularly in the field of neuroscience.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how neurons that regulate energy homeostasis also regulate sleep.  Previous studies indicate that sleep/wake states are significantly affected by food need and availability, but the role of neurons that regulate food intake in sleep/wake behavior is unknown.  The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus contains two populations of neurons that regulate food intake behavior: orexigenic agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons.  Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that AgRP neurons can independently promote wakefulness and food intake and that POMC neurons maintain sleep states in addition to suppressing appetite.  Previous data also suggest that AgRP and POMC neurons might influence sleep/wake states by projecting to hypocretin-expressing neurons and melanin-concentrating hormone-expressing neurons, respectively, in the lateral hypothalamus.  This project will use cutting-edge optogenetic and chemogenetic methods in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral analyses to increase our understanding of these systems in sleep/wake behavior and thus how the brain coordinates complex behavioral states. Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this work, which will further impact the field of neuroscience through the hands-on training it will provide for the next generation of scientists and educators."

The bedrock hidden beneath this ice sheet may provide clues to how today's continents formed, while the ice itself contains records of Earth's atmosphere from distant eras. New drilling technologies are now available to allow for direct sampling of these materials from more than two kilometers below the ice surface. However, getting this material will require knowing where to look. The Southern Plateau Ice-sheet Characterization and Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (SPICECAP) project will use internationally collected airborne survey data to search East Antarctica near the South Pole for key locations that will provide insight into Antarctica's geology and for locating the oldest intact ice on Earth.  Ultimately, scientists are interested in obtaining samples of the oldest ice to address fundamental questions about the causes of changes in the timing of ice-age conditions from 40,000 to 100,000 year cycles.  SPICECAP data analysis will provide site survey data for future drilling and will increase the overall understanding of Antarctica's hidden ice and geologic records.  The project involves international collaboration and leveraging of internationally collected data.  The SPICECAP project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>This study focuses on processing and interpretation of internationally collected aerogeophysical data from the Southern Plateau of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The data include ice penetrating radar data, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetics.  The project will provide information on geological trends under the ice, the topography and character of the ice/rock interface, and the stratigraphy of the ice.  The project will also provide baseline site characterization for future drilling.   Future drilling sites and deep ice cores for old ice require that the base of the ice sheet be frozen to the bed (i.e. no free water at the interface between rock and ice) and the assessment will map the extent of frozen vs. thawed areas. Specifically, three main outcomes are anticipated for this project.   First, the study will provide an assessment of the viability of Titan Dome, a subglacial highland region located near South Pole, as a potential old ice drilling prospect.  The assessment will include determining the hydraulic context of the bed by processing and interpreting the radar data, ice sheet mass balance through time by mapping englacial reflectors in the ice and connecting them to ice stratigraphy in the recent South Pole, and ice sheet geometry using laser altimetry.   Second, the study will provide an assessment of the geological context of the Titan Dome region with respect to understanding regional geologic boundaries and the potential for bedrock sampling.   For these two goals, we will use data opportunistically collected by China, and the recent PolarGAP dataset.   Third, the study will provide an assessment of the risk posture for RAID site targeting in the Titan Dome region, and the Dome C region.  This will use a high-resolution dataset the team collected previously at Dome C, an area similar to the coarser resolution data collected at Titan Dome, and will enable an understanding of what is missed by the wide lines spacing at Titan Dome.  Specifically, we will model subglacial hydrology with and without the high resolution data, and statistically examine the detection of subglacial mountains (which could preserve old ice) and subglacial lakes (which could destroy old ice), as a function of line spacing."

Rooftop runoff is largely underused, but has the potential to provide potable water to communities where treated water is limited or unavailable. In order to determine the potential for rooftop runoff to serve as a small-scale drinking water source, research must be conducted on the impact of atmospheric pollution, specifically smog, on the quality of the runoff from storm events. Many Chinese residents lack access to potable water, and regularly face the additional hardship of heavy atmospheric pollution. Professor Yungfeng Yang of Tsinghua University School of Environment, an expert in environmental microbiology and microbe mediated biogeochemistry, will serve as host and mentor. Results from this project could assist in making rooftop runoff a viable water source for people in heavily populated and polluted cities throughout the world, including the USA. <br/><br/>A lack of access to water, complexes to store and treat water, and exposure to excessive amounts of fluorine and arsenic in groundwater sources prevent many Chinese citizens from acquiring clean drinking water. Utilization of rooftop runoff has the potential to improve the accessibility of water sources. In addition to lacking clean water, Chinese citizens' health is also heavily impacted by atmospheric pollution which is influenced by industrial activities, traffic, and coal burning. Particulate Matter (PM2.5) accumulates in the form of smog, which has been proven to reduce visibility, contribute to acid rain, and get trapped in lungs. Beijing, China and Los Angeles, United States both sit in a bowl-like depression which can trap particulates that can cause smoggy conditions; however, regulations have proved successful in preventing Los Angeles from having serious smog problems. Poor atmospheric conditions negatively impact rooftop runoff quality and produces bacterial contamination. This study will investigate the impact of atmospheric conditions on rooftop runoff quality in Beijing in order to develop rooftop runoff collection and treatment techniques that could provide potable water to Chinese residents in need. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. Graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Today, over 56 million people in the United States report some degree of disability, a number which will likely grow in coming years as the so-called ""baby boomer"" generation ages.  RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities.  RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in both non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology.  The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field.  Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers.  It encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers as well as participants in previous SDCs, many of whom are now leaders in service, research, and education related to technology for persons with disabilities.  Furthermore, continuing a practice started a few years ago, all participants (not just the finalists) will create blog posts that capture and archive their submissions, and these will remain accessible indefinitely through the RESNA website and the AT Wiki.  Thus, educators will be able to share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done, while service providers and persons with disabilities will be able to search for unique solutions to barriers they may face.  More information about RESNA and its annual conference is available online at http://www.resna.org while information specific to the SDC may be found at http://aac-rerc.psu.edu/wordpressmu/RESNA-SDC and student team entry abstracts are included on the AT Wiki http://atwiki.assistivetech.net/index.php/ATWiki_Home.<br/><br/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities.  The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference; since then over 265 designs have been identified as winning entries from among over 850 submitted by students from over 125 different universities and institutes of higher learning.  Both undergraduate and master's level graduate candidates are eligible to submit entries, which must represent the work of students only; no faculty or professionals may be included as co-authors, although faculty may be mentioned as advisors and/or mentors.  NSF has been a supporter since 2005.  This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities.  A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools.  A team of 5 judges will pre-select at least 6 semi-finalist teams, from each of which two members will be invited to attend the conference fully supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration.  At the beginning of the conference these teams will make presentations and show off their working prototypes to the judges before a public audience during a platform session on Wednesday, June 28, where 5 finalist teams will be selected.  Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams.  In addition, finalists will have an opportunity to present their projects during the Annual Developers' Forum later that evening, which highlights new products under development (some past SDC student team designs have been patented and are now available commercially)."

Like us, many animals have immune systems that help them to fight diseases.  However, many animals also use medicines.  Animals often use plants as sources of medicine and must search their local ?green pharmacy? for the appropriate drugs. These natural medicines are used together with the immune system to help the animal fight infection. But what happens when the quality of plant-based medicines changes because the environment changes? Scientists do not fully understand how our rapidly changing world will affect animal immunity and, through it,  disease in natural populations. Monarch butterflies are attacked by a parasite that is related to those that cause malaria and toxoplasmosis in humans.  When monarchs get infected with their parasite, they find it difficult to fly and to reproduce.  However, monarchs can use natural medicines in milkweed plants in combination with their own immune systems to help combat their parasites. This research will help scientists understand how the medicinal compounds that are available in milkweed change with the environment, and how changes in medicines available to the butterflies affect their ability to use them to fight the parasite.  New diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate and the impacts of environmental change on animal immune function may make this trend worse. Understanding the influence of environmental change on animal immunity will help scientists and managers to predict which animals are most at risk and where, as well as facilitate improved management decisions.<br/><br/><br/>This project will address how changing medicinal and nutritional quality affects parasites' ability to harm their hosts. It will do so by exploring the effects of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on the medicinal (secondary chemistry) and nutritional (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) quality of host diet. The researchers will examine how dietary effects on immunity underlie corresponding shifts in a host?s ability to limit parasite infection success, and mitigate the fitness costs of infection at a given pathogen load. This work will be conducted using a system with a high degree of diet dependency: the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, and its protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). Secondary and primary metabolites of the milkweed (Asclepias) plants that monarchs consume convey increased performance against OE. Critically, elevated CO2 alters the medicinal and nutritional quality of milkweed foliage. This research will be the first to elucidate the effects of whole plant chemistry on host immunity and performance."

This project aims to investigate one threat--decreased water quality in the GBR lagoon--by linking the impacts of long-term grazing management with sediment export and erosion in the Burdekin Basin. Though the impacts of land-cover on gully erosion have been well documented through small-scale, plot-based experiments, there is little knowledge of the long-term effects of historical grazing management to gully activity and rate of expansion. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Scott Wilkinson, an expert in gully erosion, at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia. By comparing historical records and vegetation surveys, this research will provide a quantitative analysis of gully erosion in upland rangelands, aiding CSIRO and the Australian government in the effort to improve water quality and preserve the Great Barrier Reef. <br/><br/>Seawater temperature rise, ocean acidification, and decreased water quality in the GBR lagoon are causing considerable degradation and mortality to the GBR. CSIRO attributes 40% of all fine sediment imported to the GBR lagoon to rangeland gully erosion in the catchment basins. Erosion is directly linked to land-cover; studies in the GBR have shown that a 5-15% increase in vegetation cover can reduce sediment erosion by 35-60%, thereby decreasing sediment yield and improving water quality in the GBR lagoon. However, there is little knowledge about the long-term effects of grazing management and gully activity. For specific gully-prone soil types, this project will evaluate the long-term effects of different grazing management and stocking rates on gully stability by comparing historical remote sensing imagery of vegetation cover to surveys of gully stability at 10-20 different properties. This research project aims to provide a quantitative assessment of grazing and erosion and determine criteria to identify zones exceedingly vulnerable to over-proportioned sediment export for priority preventative management. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Some seeds can produce a gelatinous covering many times the size of the seed that expands when the seed gets wet. This functional trait, known as mucilage, may be an important way plants deal with stressful environments--for instance, by increasing seed germination percentage and seedling establishment in conditions of water stress--yet little is known about the trait This study will compare seeds from Plantago lanceolata, known as common plantain, that experience different habitat across the globe.  The researcher will determine the frequency of this trait in dry habitats, its effect on seed germination, plant growth, and plant success under low and unpredictable water availability. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Zhenying Huang, an expert on seed mucilage at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the Central Mongolian Field Station.<br/><br/>Seed mucilage (myxospermy) is found in 230 genera of angiosperms and has been demonstrated to serve a variety of ecological functions including aid in dispersal and germination.  There is a trade-off between seed number per fruit and mucilage in P. coronopus along a latitudinal gradient, suggesting that seed mucilage may be costly to produce and mitigate stressful environments (increased temperature and reduced precipitation). The researcher will use a common garden experiment to conduct an intraspecific study on myxospermy in P. lanceolata, a perennial species with a global distribution.  The researcher will ask if seed mucilage increases germination and establishment of P. lanceolata under low and high osmotic stress. Through comparison of spatially dispersed populations, the researcher will determine whether seed mucilage production differs along a temperature or precipitation gradient. The researcher predicts that the seed to mucilage ratio will be greater in arid and highly stochastic environments where buffering may be needed. Another prediction is that seed mucilage will improve fitness when seeds are exposed to osmotic stress. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Instead of using a time consuming and potentially dangerous visual inspection process, building and structure owners and operators can remotely assess icing conditions on any surface where ice could accumulate. Adopting this time and cost saving technology reduces the risk of the public and workers being harmed by falling ice, and also assists managers in making the appropriate operating decisions for icing mitigation measures such as activation of a deicing system.  Initial applications may include bridges, tall buildings, bus terminals, museums and other structures.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a water phase sensor that determines the icing condition at a point on the surface of structure. When a structure goes through an icing cycle (ice accumulation, ice persistence and ice shedding), water changes phase from liquid to solid and back. When ice accumulates, water freezes on the surface which can be detected by the sensor. Before the ice sheds, water starts to appear beneath the ice layer. The sensor can also identify this water. This technology is the only point source surface mounted ice detector, and thus is distinguished from other technologies that do not attach on a surface and that utilize the weather conditions in the local area to predict the presence of ice on a surface. In addition, the other detection technologies utilize materials that are different from the material of the structure's surface. For these reasons, existing sensors may not provide a good representation of ice collecting on the actual surface of the structure. This sensor's accuracy, reliability, and durability have been demonstrated through laboratory and field tests. This testing includes three years of deployment in the field."

Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community.  For example, the material from which stars and planets form, interstellar clouds, and even planetary rings all consist of dusty plasma. Dusty plasmas are also present on the Earth, particularly in industrial plasma applications, while the controlled formation of dust crystals in a laboratory setting provides a useful analog for both atomic and molecular systems, allowing fundamental progress in our understanding of the physics involved. As such, dusty plasma research enables the progress of science while allowing insight into practical issues of yield efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing. This award will also impact the STEM workforce through engagement of students who will develop computation and modeling skills, obtain practical experience with instrumentation, and improve their technical writing and presentation skills. <br/><br/>A proper understanding of the physics underlying the field of dusty plasma research is complicated by the fact that the majority of research conducted occurs in a gravitational environment (i.e., on the Earth). This project directly addresses this issue, utilizing a multinational collaboration to compare studies on self-ordering of interacting complex plasma dust particles collected on the Earth to experimental results employing the PK-4 facility under microgravity. Data obtained will be compared with data from two different ground-based experiments as well as to results provided by numerical modeling of the plasma / dust environment using a comprehensive set of analysis techniques. This combination will be used to define the parameter space where particular wave modes can exist, and to develop comprehensive theories on interparticle potential and grain-plasma interactions, determining the microscopic and macroscopic properties of the complex plasma.  The results obtained will directly impact research in astrophysics and planetary science (e.g., dust in protoplanetary disks, charged dust on the surface of airless bodies, such as the moon and asteroids, planetary ring systems), atmospheric physics (e.g., noctilucent clouds), fusion research (e.g., dust contamination), materials physics (e.g., soft matter, metastable states, complex fluids, granular matter), and advanced manufacturing (e.g., semiconductor, etching, and deposition systems).

Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopies are used to study the charge transport dynamics at the earliest stages, where the influence of electronic coherences is manifest. More specifically, this project is investigating how coherent charge transfer from a donor to two or more electron acceptors occurs within molecular building blocks of organic semiconductors. Separately, the project investigates coherent charge transfer in thin solid films of organic semiconductors. Additionally, the influence of quantum interference in multi-path charge transfer processes on the rate and efficiency of electron-hole pair production in organic semiconductors is addressed.

Nonequilibrium phenomena are omnipresent and range from weather patterns to life itself. For systems that are out of equilibrium two complementary aspects, both equally relevant, can be distinguished. These are stationary states, wherein the system will remain if not pushed from the outside, and the relaxation towards these stationary states. Gaining a better understanding of both the stationary properties and the relaxation processes are needed in order to fully understand the world around us, and to develop new ways to use these processes for tailoring the properties of various systems of interest, ranging from novel materials to biological systems and ecosystems. <br/>The study of systems far from equilibrium poses many challenges, both on the fundamental and on the practical level. Whereas there is a well-established theoretical framework for equilibrium systems, a similar comprehensive framework for non-equilibrium systems and processes remains elusive. This project aims at exploiting a variety of analytical and numerical techniques to advance understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena. The project covers both fundamental and applied aspects. One important activity focuses on the investigation of the stability of food webs to various perturbations, as for example species extinction, species migration or seasonal changes. Related to this is the question of ecomanagement and the targeted intervention in predator-prey systems in order to achieve specific goals, as for example maintaining  biodiversity or removing a detrimental species. Another activity investigates the relaxation properties in model systems used to describe synchronization phenomena in biology. This investigation will allow to explore possible relationships between physical and biological aging.<br/>The project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can learn and contribute in a substantial and meaningful way. This training through research approach allows to involve students at every level in cutting-edge research projects.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education toward developing a theory of systems far from equilibrium. Non-equilibrium processes in nature and in human activities, such as making and processing materials, abound, and a unifying theoretical description of non-equilibrium interacting many-body systems remains elusive. The study of specific model systems can lead to progress in understanding systems far from equilibrium through revealing universal properties, using the large toolbox of numerical and analytical methods provided by statistical physics. The PI will combine advanced analytical and numerical techniques to address fundamental questions and potential applications of systems far from equilibrium through three different research thrusts. The first research thrust focuses on directed spin models that are prototypical examples of system that evolve to the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution even though detailed balance is violated due to the irreversibility of the dynamics. Preliminary results for the two-dimensional directed Ising model show that in the low temperature phase directedness yields a remarkable acceleration of the dynamics, manifested by a change in the value of the dynamical exponent. The research on directed spin models, addresses both fundamental aspects, such as change in dynamic properties due to irreversibility, and applied aspects, such as algorithmic tools to accelerate convergence to equilibrium. New insights into the properties of systems that violate detailed balance but fulfill the weaker condition of global balance are expected to result. For some classes of systems, directed models have the potential to become an algorithmic tool to accelerate convergence to equilibrium, which could have impact on many disciplines. The second research thrust proposes to investigate relaxation processes and the responses to perturbations in many-species systems. Food webs, discussed in the context of population dynamics, allow to gain insights into generic issues related to biodiversity and species extinction. Many of these food webs exhibit remarkable space-time patterns in a spatial setting that warrant an in-depth characterization. The PI plans (1) to study the stability of an ecological system, more specifically its response to perturbations, both small and large, and how it relaxes to the steady state, and (2) to investigate the control of an ecology, for example in order to assure biodiversity and avoid species extinction. Optimal control theory will be exploited as an analytical tool for understanding targeted interventions in predator-prey systems. This study is expected to yield valuable insights into the ecomanagement of non-trivial food webs. The third research thrust is devoted to the study of physical aging in coupled classical rotators. Coupled classical rotators and related systems present a class of systems with dynamic properties reminiscent of spin glasses. The PI will study the aging properties of these systems, investigate their responses to perturbations, and explore the existence of memory and rejuvenation effects. This study of coupled oscillators and related systems, with known biological applications, will provide an opportunity to explore possible relationships between physical and biological aging.<br/><br/>Due to the ubiquity of non-equilibrium processes in nature, this research project may have impact beyond the boundaries of condensed matter physics. Gaining a better understanding of transient and steady-state properties in systems amenable to an in-depth investigation using the large toolbox of statistical physics should contribute to the development of a more general theory that describes systems far from equilibrium. This project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can learn and contribute in a substantial and meaningful way. This training through research approach allows to involve students at every level in cutting-edge research projects."

The equations considered have deep connections with a host of other areas of mathematics, including the calculus of variations, differential games, dynamical systems, geometry, homogenization theory, inverse problems, and optimal control theory. The main goal of the project is to discover new underlying principles and general methods to understand the properties of solutions of the differential equations under investigation. One of the key objects of the research is homogenization theory, in which the models (say, of physical or social phenomena) are set in heterogeneous media and have many parameters varying on a small scale. If one zooms out and looks at the macroscopic scale, one often sees a simple effective (averaging) behavior. To make practical use of the models, it is extremely important to understand deeply the qualitative and quantitative aspects of this effective behavior.<br/><br/>The project has two overarching themes: (i) going beyond mere well-posedness in order to understand fine properties of both the limiting process and the effective equation in homogenization theory (e.g., shape of the effective Hamiltonian, optimal rate of convergence), and (ii) advancing knowledge of the duality method and fully nonlinear elliptic equations (e.g., representation formulas of solutions, the vanishing discount problem, regularity). The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed new approaches in these (and related) topical areas, approaches that have already provided solutions to some open problems. These methods are expected to be developed further in this project, thereby bringing fresh perspectives on and insights into the field of viscosity solutions."

A precise measurement of the dynamics and arrangement of quarks inside the proton will provide experimental input needed to improve the quantitative understanding of the strong nuclear force. COMPASS produces enormous amounts of experimental and Monte-Carlo simulation data.  With its massive data storage capabilities and petascale processing capabilities, Blue Waters will turn the COMPASS data into unique images of quark position and motion inside the proton and will thus refine the theory, Quantum Chromo Dynamics, describing the strong nuclear force."

Such systems play an important societal role; for example, they are central to the elliptic curve cryptography currently in use around the world. A dynamical system consists of an ambient space, along with a rule for how points in that space move over time. Dynamical systems constructed from finite fields are objects of fundamental mathematical interest, both theoretically and for practical applications to modern cryptography, which involves iterating a process that is hopefully hard to reverse. In studying a dynamical system, one often tries to understand the points that are the most well-behaved: fixed points, which do not move over time, and more generally periodic points, which are eventually brought back to their original locations after a finite amount of time. This project is a computational exploration of quadratic dynamical systems over finite fields, which are the simplest interesting examples, efficiently defined by a single quadratic polynomial. The researcher will examine patterns in the counts, over different finite fields, of how many systems having a given structure of periodic points there are. The project will be conducted at University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, under the mentorship of Professor John Roberts. This provides access to their uniquely strong group of researchers working in computational number theory along with important high-performance computating resources.<br/><br/>These counts of pointed dynamical systems will be conducted over 1) finite fields whose sizes are growing powers of a fixed prime number, and 2) finite fields of prime size for different primes.  The first approach can be used, thanks to the Lang-Weil estimates, to examine the irreducibility of reductions of dynatomical curves, important geometric objects which parameterized the dynamical systems under consideration. The second approach has been fruitful in recent years in uncovering unexpected geometric structure in sequences of moduli spaces, in particular in the case of the moduli space of curves of fixed genus with an increasing number of marked points. The researcher will also apply recently developed closed-point sieve methods to questions of how closely degree d polynomial dynamical systems can approximate random d-to-1 dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

In a boom-bust cycle, communities rich in natural resources experience rapid economic growth when demand spikes, then rapid economic decline when resources are exhausted or demand dissipates. Both trends are often accompanied by increases in crime, infrastructure damage, and environmental degradation, and reduced quality of life. There is little research on how communities use the tools of county and city-level governance - such as public investment, subsidies, taxes, and zoning - to manage societal problems linked to boom-bust cycles and perpetuate positive impacts, such as increases in local employment, after a boom ends. The project identifies governance strategies used by localities in three U.S. states (Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia) affected by the recent shale drilling boom and bust. It examines how community characteristics and local and regional networks of information and resource-sharing among policymaking participants may influence the strategies communities adopt. Finally, it studies how citizens and stakeholders perceive these strategies and which factors encourage communities to deploy more successful governance approaches.<br/> <br/>This project is a mixed-methods investigation of the strategies that local governments pursue to mitigate adverse impacts and leverage positive aspects of the shale drilling boom-bust cycle. By conducting interviews and analyzing survey data with social network and statistical techniques, the research team examines how Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia communities overlaying the Marcellus and Utica Shales have tried to manage the boom-bust cycle. Specifically, the researchers investigate: how pressures from citizens, stakeholders, and government actors affect whether cities and counties adopt boom-bust governance strategies, which strategies they choose, and how strategies diffuse among jurisdictions; whether systematic differences exist between jurisdictions that fail to consider a given approach, fail to adopt it, or adopt it successfully; and how the composition of and strength of ties within local governance networks influence the strategies jurisdictions adopt and how successful citizens, stakeholders, and decision makers view the strategies. The project brings a cross-sectional, quantitative approach to issues typically studied with qualitative, small-n techniques, building theoretical micro-foundations for and testing key assumptions in the policy diffusion and adoption, sustainability, and boom-bust literatures. The research aims to produce actionable insights for communities currently experiencing pernicious boom-bust effects."

Could this intensified competition be strong enough to cause species extinctions? This research will provide one of the few experimental tests of this scenario, using alpine plant communities of the southern Rocky Mountains, CO, USA. This project expands upon past work by coupling competition experiments with mathematical models to predict population growth into the future and to generalize the results to other ecosystems. This research will provide new insights for the management of alpine and other ecosystems under variable temperature and precipitation patterns, specifically for species important in wildlife management, recreation, and restoration. In addition, this project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students and the public by utilizing the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Science Festival and Kids Nature Camp outreach programs.<br/><br/>The researchers have used niche models to inform an experiment that transplanted alpine species into the low elevation plant communities expected to encroach upslope. Results suggest that focal alpine species performance is reduced more by low elevation plant communities than by resident alpine communities.

These models are aimed at long-term predictions of focal species population growth under experimental conditions to determine their viability in a competitive environment altered by increased temperatures. This project will generalize these results to a wider set of systems and species. The researchers will collect plant trait and environmental data on focal species and competing communities to parameterize a new trait-based model aimed at predicting competitive interaction outcomes from differences in species traits. By predicating the competitive environment on newly measured trait-environment relationships, this project will produce a priori predictions of plant performance in various physical and competitive environments."

Our everyday devices are ever more capable, cheaper, and faster. Most of these consumer items' inbuilt technology exists because of fundamental advances in condensed matter research. Future advances will happen because of curiosity driven exploration of new regimes presently accessible only in a laboratory environment. The research to be conducted in this program will examine the special properties of superfluid 3He when confined in precisely defined structures less than a thousandth of a millimeter tall, marking the transition from bulk three-dimensional behavior to a new two-dimensional regime. Undergraduate students and Ph.D students will design and fabricate these structures opening up a new area of quantum nano-fluidics.  The surfaces will have to have a well-defined smoothness - and the surface coating (with pure helium 4 or helium 3 under a magnetic field) should alter the types of superfluid states (""phases"") that emerge. These phases should show a property ""chirality"" that should have properties like a spinning top. Further, the conversion from one state to another (""phase transition"") should reveal whether models of the early universe (important for our understanding of the evolution of the universe) can be tested in the laboratory. Past graduate students and undergraduates working with this research group have gone on to productive careers in academia, high-technology industries and the financial sector, and the planned research will prepare a new generation of students for challenging careers. The size range where the system transforms from a nearly three-dimensional material to a more two-dimensional system will be revealed by new phases. These new phases should exhibit novel characteristics such as highly conducting ""edge states"" that are scientifically ""exciting"" and that could, in the future form the basis of new types of devices for metrology and computation. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Superfluid 3He can inform research activity that extends across many fields in Physics. The project combines nanofluidics (intricate and precisely fabricated cavities with sizes tuned to the scale of the superfluid's coherence length) with low temperature physics, to expose new size effects. The experimental activity will probe excitations using transport (superfluid density and heat conductivity) as well as a novel nanoscale ultra-fine wire to act as a local thermometer or spectrometer. Researchers expect that entirely new p-wave superfluid states can be stabilized by such confinement and the balance between the superfluid ground state that preserves (3He-B) or breaks (3He-A) time reversal symmetry will also be affected by confinement. By measuring the phase diagram of confined 3He both with and without an applied magnetic field, details of the pressure and temperature dependence of the strong coupling strength will be mapped out allowing for more reliable prediction of the phase diagrams of 3He under confinement.  Confinement will also provide the means to study the surface/edge excitations emerging as a result of bulk/edge correspondence. Furthermore this research activity will provide a new example of ""cosmology in the laboratory"". Studies of the first-order transition between the confined A and B phases, radically different from nucleation in bulk, will potentially provide a model of processes during the inflationary epoch of the early universe. New geometries will explore the physics of quantum transport across single and multiple interfaces. By combining low temperatures and nano fabrication, graduate students and undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting training ground that has prepared scientists for lead roles in academia and high-technology industries. Eventually, the new superfluids that emerge under confinement might be of interest in quantum computation."

This project investigates a novel approach to autonomously control the thermal and mechanical properties of building façades using pressure-regulated metamaterials. Unlike mechanically actuated kinetic louvers that require numerous moving parts and high operational energy, the deformable mesostructure of some metamaterials can respond to fluidic pressure and collectively change the envelope properties at macroscale level. This will lead to radically less maintenance and lower life-cycle cost. It also offers advantage over smart materials by providing adaptation to much broader variations in climate conditions and occupant demands.

The hypotheses of this research are (1) the reversible volume reaction between fluids and pressure-responsive metamaterials can be utilized to manipulate the thermal and mechanical properties of building façade; and (2) building energy and structural efficiencies can be synergistically improved by allowing the envelope system to dynamically interact with the changing environments. Specifically, three interrelated tasks will be carried out where: (1)  a computational framework will be established to design and optimize pressure-responsive metamaterials with adjustable thermal and mechanical properties; (2) an autonomous control strategy will be formulated based on Model-Free Reinforcement Learning method to enable the otherwise passive building envelope to learn and adapt to the continually changing environments; and lastly (3) full-scale component validation tests and case studies will be performed to quantify the energy saving potential."

While many people are familiar with how antibiotics are used for human health, the vast majority of antibiotics produced today are used to promote the health and growth of livestock. As with many medicines, up to 80% of the total dosage of active antibiotics are eliminated through animal waste, like feces and urine, and introduced to the surrounding environment. Although previous research has found more antibiotic-resistant organisms near livestock farms than generally, scientists do not fully understand how antibiotics coming from livestock waste impact important organisms in soils that are exposed to them: soil microbes, like bacteria and fungi, and invertebrates, like millipedes, pillbugs, spiders and insects. Healthy communities of microbes and invertebrates are responsible for recycling nutrients in soils and making them available to plants and the animals that eat them. This research will help scientists understand how the common practice of adding antibiotics to soils, by applying contaminated livestock manure to crop soils, may be disrupting the nutrient-cycling soil organisms, and how well these organisms can make nutrients available. Through this research, scientists, farmers and the public can promote responsible waste management practices that will help protect our ecosystems and benefit human health.

This research fills a critical gap in our understanding of three important ecological phenomena: (1) how antibiotics affect community structure of soil microbes and invertebrates, (2) which invertebrate and microbial taxa are most important to decomposition and greenhouse gas emission, and (3) how disrupting invertebrate microbiomes drives mortality in invertebrate communities. Furthermore, by conducting our proposed study at an agricultural field site, we provide insight into what governs the health and function of a globally prominent and economically important ecosystem."

This question will <br/>be addressed using cosmogenic exposure dating of the beryllium-10 isotope bedrock and boulder surfaces in <br/>previously proposed ice-free areas.  Together with detailed mapping of the paleo-ice margin from publicly <br/>available topographic data and aerial imagery, exposure ages from these locations will allow the doctoral <br/>student to reconstruct the maximum extent of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet.  (2) What was the timing and <br/>pace of retreat of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet?  Cosmogenic beryllium-10 dating of rock surfaces along <br/>coast-to-inland transects will be used to resolve this question, which has implications for basic <br/>understanding of the sensitivity of marine-terminating ice sheets to climate change.  (3) What environmental <br/>factors, such as ocean warming, atmospheric warming, and sea-level rise, influenced ice-sheet retreat?  The <br/>retreat chronology developed in this study will be correlated with existing climate and sea-level records to <br/>test the hypothesis that ocean warming was the primary factor influencing marine ice-sheet collapse in <br/>southeastern Alaska."

At the heart of a microprocessor is a complex integrated circuitry, which consists of billions of intricately fabricated nanostructures. Miniaturization of micro-circuit structures and ensuing exponential increase in computing speed and processing power has followed the predictions of ""Moore's Law"". Such aggressive miniaturization necessitates a paradigm shift from traditional manufacturing approaches to newer nanomanufacturing technologies for atomically precise manipulation, deposition and etching of materials. In spite of numerous efforts, a versatile technology for atomically precise etching that meets the requirements of cost and atomic-level control is presently unavailable. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project advances knowledge in scalable, low-cost electrochemical processes with the creation of pathways for tailoring and etching of metals with atomic precision. The project bridges various disciplines in science and engineering, including chemistry, electrochemical engineering, process design, and materials characterization. The research provides educational experiences, industrial traineeships and fellowships to graduate and undergraduate students including students from underrepresented groups. Engagement with industry helps develop a model platform for industry-university collaboration on cutting-edge electrochemical technologies for next generation integrated circuits. <br/><br/>To date, much progress has been made in the atomic layer etching of semiconductors. However, atomic layer etching of metals is still in its infancy. Plasma-assisted approaches to etch metals have encountered many technical hurdles including surface contamination by volatile byproducts and lack of atomic-level precision. The project investigates a new liquid-phase electrochemical approach for the atomic layer etching of metals. Through the use of novel self-limiting electrochemical reactions and selective etching chemistries, this research advances knowledge in atomically precise etching of metals such as copper. Fundamental aspects of the chemistry of atomic layer etching are investigated leading to the identification of process parameters for precision etching of integrated circuits. To assess the scale-up potential of the atomic layer etching process, nano-patterned geometries on large area silicon wafers are created with in situ diagnostics and process monitoring and studied. The resulting process could become an enabler of atomically precise manufacturing of structures in future nanoelectronics circuits."

Mistletoes are parasitic plants that reduce the growth of their host eucalyptus trees but also promote increased bird diversity in forests, resulting in conflicting opinions about how mistletoes affect forest function and productivity. Assessing how biologically-important nutrients, such as nitrogen, cycle through forests in response to mistletoe parasitism may give insight into forest health and function.  Changes in nitrogen processes resulting from increasing abundance of mistletoe will likely have ramifications for forest health and global climate, and may inform future land management decisions in Australian woodlands and elsewhere. This project, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Elise Pendall at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University in Australia, will explore the role of mistletoe for nitrogen cycling in eucalyptus woodlands. Dr. Pendall is a renowned ecosystem ecologist known for her work in biogeochemical cycling in response to ecological disturbances.<br/><br/>Relatively little is known about the impacts of Amyema miquelii mistletoe litter on decomposition, nitrification, and denitrification processes in woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus moluccana and E. fibrosa found in Cumberland Plain, Australia.

This study will explore how rates of various components of nitrogen cycling respond to increasing proportions of A. miquelii litter in Eucalyptus forests. By analyzing the quality and quantity of litterfall from plants, the soil microbial activity responsible for processing plant litter and its nitrogenous components, and the emissions of  N2O from forest soils, the researcher will determine the increasing contribution of A. miquelii to soil processes and nitrogen cycling in previously nitrogen-poor systems.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Recently, many atomically thin materials have been realized that each offer unique properties ranging from superconductors to semiconductors and insulators.  By combining these atomically thin materials in vertical heterostructures, new electronic properties are expected to emerge.  Spatially resolved probes offer a unique opportunity for precision measurement and control of the electronic properties of these two dimensional materials.  These probes have the ability to measure the orientation of the materials and the interactions between them.  These quantities ultimately determine the type of states that can be created in the heterostructures.  The results obtained in this proposal will lead to the development of novel electronic devices, such as transistors, photodetectors and sensors.  The proposed program will provide training for graduate students as well as enable undergraduate students from underserved groups to participate in research through the Arizona Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars (ASEMS) Program, and will aim to increase the retention of these students in STEM majors.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This proposal will create and study novel correlated states in graphene heterostructures using a combination of scanning probe microscopy and electrical transport measurements.  In addition, this project will train graduate and undergraduate students in the field of nanoscience.  While graphene is a topologically trivial semi-metal, there are a wide range of other two-dimensional materials which are expected to exhibit more exotic behavior such as superconductors and topological insulators.  By creating vertical heterostructures between graphene and these other materials, unique states will be created in graphene devices.  In particular, three different types of devices will be fabricated and studied: (1) graphene on hexagonal boron nitride to create a commensurate stacking and therefore open a band gap in graphene. (2) Graphene on superconductors to study the proximity effect and the effect of a periodic magnetic field from vortices.  (3) Graphene on topological insulators and heavy metal transition metal dichalcogenides to enhance the spin-orbit interaction in graphene.  The key to an understanding of all these induced states in graphene is the ability to map their behavior on the atomic scale that the combination of scanning probe microscopy and electrical transport measurements will provide."

This connection is necessary for interhemispheric communication and information integration. The interhemispheric connection is formed and remodeled early during fetal development, but how this occurs is poorly understood. One candidate cell type involved in interhemispheric remodeling is the microglial cell, the immune cell of the brain. Microglia are spatially and temporally correlated with midline development, and known to play a role in remodeling other regions of the cerebral cortex. Understanding interhemispheric remodeling will aid our understanding of communication between the two hemispheres and disorders of the corpus callosum, the structure bridging the two hemispheres. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Linda Richards, one of the world's leading experts on development of the cortical midline, at Queensland Brain Institute in Brisbane, Australia. <br/><br/>Before the two cerebral hemispheres are fused, they are separated by a lining of leptomeningeal fibroblasts. These fibroblasts are removed during midline remodeling, but how they are eliminated is not well understood. To address this question, tissue will be immunostained for markers of leptomeningeal cells, microglial cells, and apoptotic cells. This research follows the hypothesis that microglia are involved in midline remodeling based on their temporospatial correlation and phagocytic nature. The project will assess a role for microglia along the cortical midline through immunohistochemistry by analyzing microglial phagocytosis of leptomeningeal cells, whether phagocytosed cells are apoptotic, and the morphology of phagocytic microglia. This research will provide insight into how the two cerebral hemispheres are fused, a potential novel role for microglia, and could provide an explanation for the distribution of microglia along the cortical midline.<br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Although information privacy is a concern for everyone, common tools such as spam-detecting captchas, password strength meters, security alert messages, and browser icons that indicate secure connections are often designed without considering people with visual impairments and thus are hard for this group to use.  Meanwhile, common workarounds such as audio screen readers and requests for help from other people come with their own privacy risks.  To better understand the privacy challenges people with visual impairments face, the researchers will first study their use of and known privacy concerns around technologies.  They will then work with people with visual impairments to generate, test, and improve a number of design ideas that might address those challenges and concerns.  Finally, they will work to generalize the studies and designs to other populations, including older adults who might have different privacy expectations than younger people as well as people with cognitive impairments.  The research will lead to a better understanding of privacy needs across the population, as well as ""inclusive"" designs for privacy management tools that can be better not just for underserved populations but for all people.  To spread the knowledge and increase the impact of the work, the team will hold workshops at relevant research communities and with local disability groups, as well as develop course materials on inclusive and accessible privacy for the Security Education (SEED) labs program that is widely used in education. <br/><br/>The research is organized around three main phases.  The first phase aims to learn more about the privacy needs of people with visual impairments through a combination of longitudinal diary studies, in which people record and answer questions about incidents where they felt their privacy was at risk, and observational studies of people with visual impairments and their help givers using technology in context.  The second phase looks to develop better privacy support tools; the team will focus first on privacy threat reminders and tools for privacy-respecting collaborative use as these are key issues that arose in preliminary work, but will also develop tools in response to the concerns identified in the first phase.  In each design activity, the researchers will use a participatory design approach that includes people with visual impairments (and when appropriate their help givers) on the design team, working together at both local disability support centers and at the research lab.  Designs will follow a standard iterative process, starting with initial requirements generation and review, moving through brainstorming and low-fidelity prototypes, and finally developing and testing high-fidelity prototypes.  The third phase involves using the results from the first two phases to generate guidelines for inclusive privacy design -- that is, general privacy guidelines that may apply to a wide range of user populations with varying abilities.  To do this, the team will conduct research similar to phase one, but with groups of older adults, people with cognitive impairments, and a group of younger people without disabilities; they will also test the privacy tools generated in phase two with these groups to both identify new issues that arise in these populations and modify the tools to be more broadly inclusive."

Specifically, over 400 students per year in introductory science classes at Brevard College will control remote rovers with sensors in the exploration of a 200-acre plot in the Pisgah National Forest in western North Carolina. Using an array of sensors, such as cameras, thermometers, soil moisture detectors, and a drill for geology studies, the remote-controlled robots will probe the forested environment. A submersible to study the water quality of stream-fed ponds is also part of the robot group. Students will experience the excitement of becoming researchers and guiding the rovers to explore. They will learn about flora and fauna and develop 21st-century technology skills needed in the STEM workforce. By using broadly applicable, state-of-the-art technology, the project will engage and inspire undergraduate students and faculty, while creating a set of institutional tools to share with peer institutions and informal science education centers.<br/><br/>The integration of engaging, experiential approaches using the rovers will create a rich learning environment in which students will see the connection between scientific theory and practice. Freshmen-level courses that will be affected include chemistry, biology, environmental science, geology, and physics. All students graduating from the college take at least one of the science courses plus one mathematics course. Instructors will incorporate the robotic manipulation, collection, and interpretation of data into these courses, especially the laboratory portions. By examining the rates of engagement and retention of students in STEM before and after the robotic technology has been implemented, the investigators will advance knowledge about the impact of innovative technology on undergraduate STEM education. The forest habitat data that will be gathered will also be valuable. A habitat map of a section of a national forest, which can be a longitudinal study, is important for environmental scientists and ecologists.

Microorganisms live all over the surfaces and inside of every type of larger organism on the planet, forming what is known as the ""microbiome"" of the larger hosts. This research will focus on the microbiomes of plants, which have profound impacts on plant health and performance.  This research will focus on how microbiomes affect resistance of a host to another microorganism: a disease-causing fungus. By experimentally manipulating combinations of microbiomes, host species, and whether or not the disease-causing fungus is present, the researchers will be able to find out how microbiomes affect the ability of different plant species to compete with one another and to resist disease. By growing microbes found in natural microbiomes and by using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing approaches, they will begin to identify how important microbial players affect plant health. This project will involve the training of a graduate student in cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques. Because one outcome of this work will be to identify how and whether inoculating plants with the right microbiome protects against disease, the results from this work will also contribute to the development of new approaches to fighting costly pathogens in crops, and to helping land managers promote biodiversity in natural systems. <br/><br/><br/>In the past three decades, the plant-soil feedback framework has been used to achieve theoretical and empirical breakthroughs. Phyllosphere microbial communities, which reside in or on aboveground plant tissues, are similarly diverse, but current research suffers from an inability to connect presence and identity of phyllosphere microbes to larger ecological questions. In this project, researchers will test how pathogen infection alters the fitness and growth outcomes of con- vs. heterospecific phyllosphere microbial communities, with a focus on the fungal constituents of these microbiomes. Next-generation sequencing technologies will be combined with culture-dependent approaches to study the mechanisms of fungal community assembly in the phyllosphere. Functional trait data will be collected on select fungal cultures as metrics of plant-fungal and pathogen-fungal interactions. This trait-based approach will then be used to determine whether specific traits of the fungi measured in the lab can be used to understand their abundance and role on plants. This body of work has the potential to expand the scientific community's understanding of phyllosphere community assembly, and the mechanisms by which different phyllosphere communities inhibit or facilitate plant-species coexistence on their own or in conjunction with pathogens."

The common mathematical structures that thread the various aspects of this project together are called quantum symmetries. Quantum symmetry can be thought of as an enriched notion of symmetry, adapted to model the complex structures arising in nature. In practical contexts, mathematicians and scientists are interested in studying properties of a given system (e.g., a mechanical system, a molecule, or a population of organisms). Understanding the symmetries of such a system - transformations of the system that preserve the relevant structure - provides a wealth of insight into its properties. In many contexts, the symmetries that one encounters are described by mathematical structures called groups. However, for certain complex systems (particularly those connected to quantum mechanical phenomena, or operator algebra theory), groups are insufficient to describe the relevant symmetries that arise. This results in the need for a more general mathematical notion of symmetry, and led to the concept of a quantum group. Quantum groups were formally introduced in the 1980's as a tool to study certain types of non-classical symmetries arising in statistical physics. Since that time, quantum groups (and related notions of quantum symmetry) have proved to have remarkable applications in topology, quantum algebra, operator algebras, quantum probability, quantum information theory, and the classification of topological phases of matter. By exploiting the quantum symmetries appearing in various mathematical and physical systems, this project aims to provide new insights into challenging problems in both operator algebra theory and quantum information theory.<br/><br/>This project is divided into three components. The first part concerns the structural theory of von Neumman algebras associated to a class of discrete quantum groups, called orthogonal free quantum groups. The principle aim here is to use recent exciting developments in free probability theory and geometric quantum group theory to solve a conjecture which states that these von Neumann algebras can never be isomorphic to free group factors. The second part of this project concerns the structure of a class of von Neumann algebras, called the q-deformed Araki-Woods algebras. The PI will use certain asymptotic distributional symmetries for these algebras to investigate finite dimensional approximation properties and algebraic indecomposability results. The third and final part of this project proposes completely new applications of quantum symmetries in quantum information theory (QIT). The PI will investigate a new method for constructing examples of quantum channels using representation categories of quantum groups. Applications of these new quantum channels to various relevant questions in QIT will be investigated."

In the last ten to fifteen years there has been a drive to understand a more general question: Find primes in integer sequences associated to infinite groups of symmetries of finite-dimensional spaces. Formulation of this general question followed the realization that many fundamental integer sequences are connected to groups of symmetries, for example the entries of Pythagorean triples, curvatures appearing in Apollonian circle packings, and the denominators of continued fractions formed using only a finite alphabet. In many important cases, the relevant group of symmetries is 'thin,' meaning that it is sparser than expected, and hence is not subject to classical techniques. As a result, new technology that draws on many different areas of mathematics has been developed to treat questions about thin groups and their associated integer sequences. The research in this project will study primes in integer sequences that arise in the study of moduli spaces. A moduli space is a mathematical object that encodes all geometric structures of a given type on an object, up to natural identifications. Moduli spaces often have associated groups of symmetries. These are built from integers, and so invite many intriguing number theoretic questions. In fact, these symmetry groups are sometimes thin, giving surprising new applications of the theory of thin groups. <br/><br/>The PI will study two types of counting problems. The first concerns the number fields associated to periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow on moduli spaces of abelian differentials. The PI has recently generalized Selberg's 3/16 Theorem to higher genus moduli spaces. This result will be used to obtain a congruence count for periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow. In addition, Selberg's Theorem will be extended to affine invariant submanifolds of moduli space. The second type of problem concerns the Markoff-Hurwitz affine variety and its automorphism group. The PI will study the prime factors of the coordinates of integer points on this variety by obtaining congruence lattice point counting estimates and using sieve methods. This requires understanding the orbits of the automorphism group on the points of the variety over finite fields, and extensions of this question to square-free moduli. Questions about the statistics of the series of permutations obtained by the actions of a fixed global automorphism on the points on the variety over various finite fields will be studied. These questions are related to surprising numerical results obtained in collaboration with undergraduate students."

Examples include construction of physical structures, such as nests, and techniques to process or store food. Dung beetles are especially skilled at food storage. Females roll dung from large animals into a ball, inoculate it with special microbes (bacteria), lay their eggs in it, and burry it in the soil. This study will examine the types of microbes deposited by the mother and how they help young dung beetles get nutrients from the dung. Understanding how species like dung beetles can modify their environments may be crucial to understanding how they can buffer themselves against environmental changes. This research also contributes to the training of a graduate student and the mentoring of undergraduate research assistants and high school students. <br/><br/>This research will use larval dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus as a novel system for investigating (i) the developmental, ecological, and evolutionary consequences of niche construction, and (ii) the mechanisms by which beetle larvae actively modify their developmental environment (a ball of dung), with particular focus on the role of maternally-inherited microbial symbionts. First, the researchers will experimentally assess the degree to which known outcomes of larval niche construction (e.g., enhanced growth) can be explained by the presence of maternally-inherited microbiota in dung balls. Second, the researchers will use a biochemical technique to begin assessing the metabolic capabilities of the microbiota, hypothesizing that the gut and dung ball microbiota may break down complex macromolecules (e.g. cellulose) that are otherwise indigestible by larvae. Finally, the researchers will perform 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on larval guts and dung balls to characterize the dung beetle microbiota and identify those microbial taxa that are associated with enhanced developmental outcomes. More generally, this work will advance understanding of the causes and consequences of niche construction in development and evolution, and will shed light on the importance of microbes in the nutrition and development of organisms."

In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Caroline Chick Jarrold uses a unique approach to preparing radicals by (1) stabilizing them with a negative charge, then (2) gleaning detailed information about the neutral radicals by using lasers to selectively detach the electrons in a way that the energy of the electrons precisely reflects the properties of the radicals. The specific molecules of interest are involved in production of ozone in the part of the atmosphere with negative impact on human health.

This combination of tools is being applied to OH-isoprene adducts, and species formed by ozonolysis of isoprene, which may include Criegee intermediates (carbonyl oxides believed to be formed during ozonolysis), along with non-covalent complexes the intermediates form with H2O and O2. The oxidation of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) by OH and O3 leads to the formation of a wide range of reactive open-shell molecules, the kinetics of which has been a very active area of research. The spectroscopic data from the proposed studies complements kinetics studies with more detailed electronic and molecular structural information. Additionally, the effects of water, which influences isomerization and reaction barrier heights, and O2, which can both photosensitize and react with the transients, are being probed. Spectroscopic analysis is supported collaboratively by quantum wavepacket ab initio molecular dynamics studies. The broader impacts of this project include an increase in current understanding of the complex, interconnected web of atmospheric processes, in addition to highly technical training for a postdoctoral research associate, graduate students, and undergraduates in the context of an area of global importance."

However, there are scientific questions which still remain regarding their fundamental optical properties.  There is a need for further scientific investigations which will allow scientists to tailor the structures of polymers in order to achieve better optical and electronic effects.  In this project the PI will carry out experiments with two types of organic polymeric materials.  In order to examine the optical properties of these two types of organic polymers advanced specialized laser spectroscopic measurements will be carried out.  These laser experiments will be conducted so as to determine how changes in the polymeric structure affect their optical properties.  Ultimately, the results of these optical experiments will be utilized to design new organic polymeric materials for enhanced optical applications.  This research project will also promote scientific education for high school students in the surrounding areas of southeast Michigan as well as facilitating the participation and training of undergraduate students from the University of Michigan and other undergraduate institutions with diverse backgrounds.  Among the goals and impacts of this research project will be the identification of specific properties leading to improved polymeric materials for potential optical applications, as well as an increase in the diversity of students trained in science or engineering related to polymer areas.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY :<br/><br/>Organic conjugated polymers and macromolecular aggregates are now promising candidates for many electronic and optical applications.  In order to further understand the fundamental structure-function relationships in macromolecular materials one must probe the dynamics of excitations.  In the proposed studies the PI will investigate the optical excitations of new organic polymers and macromolecular ladder-type systems.  Measurements of time-resolved and nonlinear optical properties will be carried out in these materials in order to provide new structure-function relationships to further design superior materials.  Measurements in solution as well as in the solid state will be carried out on the new macromolecular materials.  The effects of energy transfer, charge transfer and exciton diffusion will be probed with time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption experiments in solution and in solid thin films.  The results of the time-resolved measurements will be utilized to design new materials with better optical properties for nonlinear optical applications.  This investigation will facilitate the progress in scientific training of high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students.  The investigation will also enhance the participation of women and minority scientists in the area of polymer physics and materials science with activities related to increasing the diversity of faculty in this area of research."

Hundreds of languages are spoken on the continent besides English, French, and Spanish, and these languages are unevenly distributed, with far more diversity in some places than others.  Although this language diversity is well documented and fundamentally affects how humans communicate, relatively little is known about the processes that have shaped the geographic patterns of language diversity.  The investigators will refine a new simulation modeling approach to provide new understanding regarding the degree to which different social and environmental processes have influenced language diversity patterns over the last 10,000 years.  The methods the project will use will provide new tools for larger-scale and longer-term contributions to the discovery of processes that influence multiple facets of cultural diversity across the planet.  The investigators will map North American language diversity and produce an open-access resource for the researchers, educators, students, and the public.  The project will further enhance an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers and will increase the utility of a global, open-access database created to enable studies of cultural and linguistic diversity.  The project also will provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Why do humans collectively speak so many languages, and why is the geographic distribution of these languages so uneven?  Dating back centuries, researchers from many disciplines have debated the degree to which different sociocultural, environmental, and geographic factors have shaped linguistic diversity, but the few tests of these hypotheses have failed to reach consensus due to methodological limitations, including inadequacies in multivariate analytic approaches, the failure to account for non-independence of societies due to spatial proximity and common ancestry, and inadequate attention to complex webs of causal factors and to spatial and temporal dynamics of diversification and extinction.  Previous research also has relied largely on correlation-based analyses, which imply only associations and cannot determine the mechanisms that lead to diversity patterns.  The investigators undertaking this project have pioneered the use of process-based simulation modeling in biogeography to overcome the prior methodological limitations.  They will build on experience gained during those activities to use recent modeling advances to conduct tests of long-standing and competing hypotheses from multiple disciplines regarding the geography of language diversity.  Previous work employing this approach enhanced understanding of how rainfall and demography shaped language diversity patterns in Australia.  By expanding their attention to North America, the investigators expect to provide new insights into the social, cultural, historical, and environmental processes that influence many facets of cultural diversity in different locales across the planet."

Here transport circulation refers to the movement of air masses and atmospheric constituents, including water vapor and chemical tracers which move over long distances before being rained out or removed by chemical reactions. The transport circulation of the atmosphere is of interest for two practical reasons: first, it plays a key role in determining air quality, as local air quality can be affected by pollutants transported from remote sources.  Second, the transport of water vapor, energy, and momentum largely determines the evolution of weather patterns.  This is true not only for daily weather but also for month-to-month and year-to-year change in weather patterns such as those associated with El Nino events, fluctuations of the jet streams, and global climate change.  In the stratosphere the transport circulation determines the distribution of ozone and the size and severity of the ozone hole.  In this project the primary focus is on the longitudinally averaged transport circulation in the north-south direction, for example the movement of constituents into and out of the tropics and polar caps, and the extent to which this movement is enhanced or impeded by various dynamical processes.  For example, to what extent do the midlatitude jet streams constitute a mixing barrier which reduces exchange between the polar caps and lower latitudes?<br/><br/>More specifically, the research seeks to 1) characterize and quantify the transport circulation using both observed winds (from reanalysis products) and mean tracer motion in numerical simulations; 2) investigate and isolate the mechanisms of tropospheric transport in idealized models; 3) examine the causes of interannual variability in the transport circulation; and 4) investigate the changes in transport circulation associated with changes in time-mean (Eulerian) circulation induced by climate change (for example, the widening of the tropics and the poleward shift of the jet streams).  The numerical simulations are performed using a hierarchy of models in which the most realistic is the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which has a well-resolved stratosphere and sophisticated representations of atmospheric chemistry. Other models include an aquaplanet configuration of a global atmospheric model, used to study the transport circulation in an idealized setting which includes the effects of atmospheric moisture (including parameterized convection).  Variations in the width of the Hadley cell, positions of the storm tracks and jet streams, and other circulation features would be created in the model by varying the imposed sea surface temperature, and the transport response to these variations would be examined.  Further experiments would be performed using an idealized dry atmospheric model driven by highly simplified physics (primarily Newtonian damping), in which transport can be studied as a function of basic factors including atmospheric stability, equator-to-pole temperature gradient, and planetary rotation rate.  Much of the diagnostic analysis of observations and model output focuses on the effective diffusivity of the longitudinally-averaged mean circulation.  A new formalism based on equivalent latitude coordinates is used in which the longitudinally averaged meridional transport of tracers is represented as a resolved eddy flux and an effective downgradient diffusive flux.<br/><br/>The education  component of this CAREER proposal is based on demonstrations and experiments performed with a portable rotating tank. The tank is rotated to induce a Coriolis force and circulations can be generated in the tank which are analogous to the motions of Earth's atmosphere.  The tank is used both on campus, in undergraduate and graduate courses, and in museum-based outreach to middle and high school student groups and to the general public.  The on-campus activity consists of a week-long lab module incorporated into six different classes, in which students identify a phenomenon of interest (for example, a midlatitude cyclone) and design an experiment in the tank to simulate and study it.  The rotating tank lab is motivated by a desire to present students with a hands-on learning experience which will allow students to develop an intuitive, hands-on appreciation for atmospheric dynamics.  In the absence of such hands-on work students in atmospheric dynamics can become so focused on mastering the mathematical formalisms that they fail to appreciate the physical significance of the dynamical equations.  The museum-based outreach would take place at teh Paleontological Research Institute's Museum of the Earth.  Two forms of outreach are planned, one consisting of 50-minute demonstrations targeted to groups of middle and high school students, and another consisting of video presentations of atmospheric circulation features and their analogs in the rotating tank. The video exhibits would be complemented by 30-minute demonstrations of the rotating tank, to be performed on a monthly basis.  The museum activities will be documented, evaluated by an external evaluator, and shared with other museums.<br/><br/>In addition to the broader impacts of the education component, work under this award has societal relevance due to the effect of the transport circulation on atmospheric weather and pollution, as noted above.  In addition, the work will have scientific broader impacts by building connections between the research communities engaged in atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric dynamics.  The work will also support and train a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Because species respond to these changes in different ways, the composition of ecological communities is also changing. One important result is the movement or ""encroachment"" of woody species of shrubs and trees into grasslands around the world. Because woody plant species have very different characteristics than non-woody plants, their encroachment can have dramatic effects. For example, encroaching plants may affect microbial organisms living in the soil, such as bacteria and fungi. These soil organisms are very important for nutrient cycling and soil health because they break down decaying plant and animal material and fertilize the soil in ways that affect plant growth. Therefore, changes in the species of microbial organisms, or how they function, could in turn affect other plants in the area. This research studies how a woody species, a sagebrush shrub, that is moving uphill in the White Mountains of California, affects composition and function of soil microbial communities and the plant species they associate with. This work will be helpful in improving land management strategies in areas experiencing woody plant encroachment. It will enable training of graduate and undergraduate students and outreach to a museum and local conservation groups.<br/><br/><br/>This project will build upon previous work demonstrating that in the White Mountains, sagebrush has been expanding its range into alpine grasslands over the last 50 years. The project will integrate field and greenhouse experiments, modern molecular and enzymatic tools for characterizing soil communities, and plant demographic modeling to: 1) assess effects of sagebrush on soil fungal community structure and extracellular enzyme production, and 2) determine how these belowground changes feed back to affect the performance of other native alpine plants. The primary hypothesis is that native range-expanding species may affect soil microbial communities in ways that have critical feedbacks on the fitness of the existing plant community, including altering nutrient cycling and the relative frequency of pathogens vs. mutualists. This research will result in a more complete understanding of the above- and belowground impacts of alpine shrub expansion. Results will provide valuable information on the long-term status of alpine plant species under future environmental and landscape change, and the underlying mechanisms that link soil microbial communities and plant performance."

The major objective of this research is to better understand how to design polymers to facilitate the decoupling of ion motion from local segmental motion. These polymers will be based on dicarboximide oxanorbornene monomers. Homopolymers and diblock copolymers will be synthesized using ring-opening metathesis polymerization. The homopolymers studied will focus on structures that have high salt solubility and an increased fragility parameter as well as structures that incorporate the salt as part of the monomer itself. The former will be studied as a function of molecular weight and with structural changes to increase the fragility parameter. The diblock copolymers will incorporate the ion conducting monomer in one block and a high modulus monomer in the other block. The diblock copolymer morphologies should allow the blending of these two properties on a nanometer lengthscale. These new materials will be evaluated by dielectric spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, DSC, and potentially solid-state NMR. If scattering data (X-rays or neutrons) are needed, this research will be conducted with collaborators or at national laboratories.

Molecular visualization, or the ability to understand three-dimensionality from two-dimensional representation, is a useful element in this building this understanding, yet few instructors teach or assess the skills needed to interpret two-dimensional images.  This project will develop strategies and approaches to help students gain these important skills.  In particular, the project will build a community of biochemistry and molecular biology educators who will help develop a set of competencies defining specific tasks that students will be expected to perform to develop their molecular visualization skills.  Specifically, during the one-year term of this project, a series of national and regional workshops will be organized to develop a community of educators who are dedicated to the task of producing reliable and valid molecular visualization concept inventories.  This group will develop a framework of goals and objectives for understanding four fundamental themes in molecular visualization - Monomer Recognition, Topology and Connectivity, Alternate Renderings, and Molecular Interactions.   The group will also develop and populate a website with the competencies arising from the workshops.<br/><br/>This project will expand a framework established following an education symposium at the 2013 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology meeting to include competencies that will ultimately lead to constructing concept inventories in molecular visualization.  This project will focus on four fundamental themes: Monomer Recognition, Topology and Connectivity, Alternate Renderings, and Molecular Interactions.  Understanding these four themes will build a foundation that allows students to comprehend the structure-function relationship inherent in biomolecules.  Regional workshops will bring together educators to identify and reach a consensus on competencies within these four themes.  These competencies will be added to the molecular visualization framework housed at http://cbm.msoe.edu/crest/molviz/ for public use.  This project has already begun to transform the way many biochemistry and molecular biology instructors use molecular representations in their classroom.  For example, several instructors understand the need to assess their students' comprehension of the representations of a particular model before they used the model to draw higher level inferences (e.g. function).  In articulating consensus-based learning goals and objectives and identifying competencies, this project will identify the foundations upon which concept inventories will be developed in future years.  Importantly, this effort will be built around workshops that establish a community of practice for the explicit instruction of molecular visualization skills."

This organic matter warms and becomes available for microbial communities to turn carbon (C) into the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide via metabolic processes.  Microbial communities play a large role in the ultimate fate of this C but have been relatively unstudied in lake sediments in these regions. Therefore, little is known about the dominant lineages present and which microbes are responsible for fueling carbon cycling in these systems. Working with leading scientists in the field of ecosystem genomics at the Australian Center for Ecogenomics, microbial communities present in these systems will be identified, allowing us to determine relationships between species and metabolism of C and contribute to our understanding of ecosystems here in the United States. <br/><br/> Due to a lack of empirical data recording interactions between microbial communities and their impacts on the metabolism of carbon (C), accurate modeling of carbon dynamics and the ultimate fate of C has been difficult. Old carbon (C) decomposes to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from thawing permafrost, which can flow into lakes and drive additional CH4 emission. Our study will address the questions: how do microbial communities interact and affect carbon cycling, which microbial lineages are dominant in lake sediments from within a thawing arctic permafrost system, and contribute to understanding of the broader question: how will climate change effect these microbial communities? DNA extractions will be taken from sediment core samples collected from Stordalen mire peatland complex in northern Sweden. The cores were previously analyzed for geochemical parameters and will be sequenced using the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method. Relationships between sequence data and geochemical measurements will be identified at both a species specific and community level, allowing us to characterize dominant lineages and record shifts in microbial communities as a function of thaw. <br/><br/>This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."

Thus, this EAPSI will investigate how geomagnetic field strength affects biodiversity and biological function in modern environments, thereby improving the rigor of magnetosomes as proxies for oxygen-poor environments and microbial diversity in deep time. The researcher will collaborate with Dr. Yongxin Pan at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. Dr. Pan is a global leader in MTB microbiology and access to his facilities and expertise will be indispensable for the success of this project. <br/><br/>Magnetofossils (fossilized magnetosomes) have the potential to encode linkages between microbial diversity, ambient environmental conditions, and external environmental forces. The goal of this EAPSI project is to test if there is a measurable relationship between the strength of the geomagnetic field, phylogeny, and magnetosome biomineralization in MTB. The researcher will test if and how the external force of the geomagnetic field affects biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, this project will demonstrate how the smallest and most sensitive organisms, microbes, respond to changes in geomagnetic field throughout time. The PI will work with Dr. Yongxin Pan, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, to culture field and laboratory samples of MTB in prescribed magnetic field intensities. She will then characterize these organisms using genomic analyses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and mineral magnetic measurements to determine how MTB cultured in variable magnetic field strengths differ phylogenetically and in magnetosome biomineralization (by observing morphology, crystallographic structure, composition, and magnetic grain size/domain state of magnetosomes).<br/><br/>This award is through the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program and supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student; it is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."

Thus, extracting the useful and interesting building blocks of a network is critical to the understanding of many systems. Indeed, the most pivotal moments in the development of a scientific field are centered on discoveries about the structure of a network. For example, chemists have found that many chemical interactions are the result of the structural principles of interactions between the elements. Biologists agree that tree structures are useful when organizing the evolutionary history of life, sociologists find that triangles are important in the development of communities, and neuroscientists continue to untangle the network dynamics of neurons in the brain. To aide in these discoveries, principled strategies for extracting network patterns are needed to discover the precise mechanisms that govern network structure and growth. This is exactly the focus of this project: to develop and evaluate techniques that learn the building blocks of real world networks that, in aggregate, simply describe the interactions expressed by the network. This project will also support educational and outreach programs that will broaden participation in computer science. Open source software implementations of the new algorithms will be made available to the public, and will also serve as an educational tool. Research supervision and career mentoring will be made available to K-12 students through the development and publication of science fair projects in computing, and undergraduate and graduate student training will be offered through a new course in data and network science. <br/><br/>This project will develop and evaluate principled techniques that learn the building blocks of real world networks. The ideas in this proposal originate from a newfound relationship between graph theory and formal language theory that allow for a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) to be extracted from any graph without loss of information. Like a context free grammar, but for graphs, the extracted HRG contains the precise building blocks of the network as well as the instructions by which these building blocks ought to be pieced together. In this project, we take the first steps towards reconciling the disparate fields of formal language and graph theory by asking incisive questions about the extraction, inference, and analysis of network patterns in a mathematically elegant and principled way. Graph mining research has scientific applications of societal importance, such as new drug therapies, knowledge networks, and natural language understanding, which will be explored as part of this project. In addition, this project will result in the formation of new interdisciplinary scientists, career mentoring, graduate and undergraduate research, and the development of science fair projects in computing for K-12 students, focusing on economically disadvantaged youth. The results will also be disseminated through tutorial and workshop organization at renowned international conferences."

Before such questions can be answered accurately, duplicated information from databases must be removed in a systematic and accurate way. In the research literature, this process is commonly known as record linkage, de-duplication, or entity resolution. This CAREER award will develop general methods and scalable algorithms for record linkage so that pressing global issues can be addressed in real time or near real time. The modeling and computational tools to be developed will significantly increase the volume of data that can be analyzed. This project will enable researchers to address a broader range of scientific questions and advance research in multiple domains, including precision medicine, official statistics, and human rights.  To facilitate these advances and encourage further development, all algorithms will be released as open source software. In terms of education, the investigator will expand the Youth in Machine Learning (YiML) program to enable 50 high school students and 50 undergraduate students per year to participate in the bootcamp and skills-building workshops offered. This will enhance the pipeline of students prepared to study machine learning in future years. At an international level, the investigator will teach workshops at the International Society for Bayesian Analysis Meeting, including a YiML workshop for women.<br/><br/>This research project will develop flexible, general Bayesian nonparametric models for record linkage tasks that propagate the amount of linkage error exactly. The project also will develop scalable record linkage algorithms. By drawing on recent advances in clustering, Bayesian nonparametrics, and probablistic dimension-reduction algorithms, this project will advance the state-of-the-art in record linkage. The models and algorithms to be developed will attempt to solve the microclustering problem, which is at the core of this research. In collaboration with domain experts, the investigator will test the new methods using data sets from health care, official statistics, and human rights. The resulting estimates may provide useful information for policy makers in these areas."

The award to Savannah State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project seeks to develop an autonomic security management framework and apply the framework to realize a self-protecting Healthcare Information System (HIS). The comprehensive self-protection system will enable HISs to autonomously assess their potential security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect realtime intrusions and react to cyber attacks, thus maintaining normal performance and enhancing patient data security and privacy. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of cyber security courses.<br/><br/>The research seeks to adopt computing technology to realize a Self-Protecting Healthcare Information System (SPHIS) that can autonomously assess system security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect real-time intrusions and react to cyber attacks with little or no human intervention. Eventually the SPHIS will maintain the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystem's normal performance and enhance patients' data security and privacy. An Internet of Things cyber security lab and Healthcare Information System cloud testbed will be built to validate the SPHIS autonomous feature and functions using real-world cyber attacks. The research will determine cyber attacks and use time series forecasting methods to initialize early warning modules and send attack alerts based on the variation of power utilization of IoMT devices. Power consumption of IoMT devices thus will be collected offline when the system is under normal and known cyber attack situations. The power data will be used to set up the IoMT ecosystem's normal behavior region by data mining techniques, and help to identify abnormal behaviors and detect cyber attacks using unsupervised learning techniques. The power data of IoMT devices will be collected online when the HIS is compromised by unknown attacks, and the power data will be analyzed by a network of forensics analysis tools. The attack patterns will be added to update the intrusion detection module.  A dynamic intrusion response system will be developed to select the optimal prevention and protection mechanisms for mitigating cyber attacks. The research promises to change the current HIS cyber security state from poorly prepared to well defended against emerging cyber attacks. This research will also contribute to development of the cyber security workforce and enhance security awareness in healthcare organizations."

These novel liquids have been proposed for a variety of applications such as electrolytes in batteries and supercapacitors, solvents, etc., and they have a number of properties that are quite different from those of more commonly known water-based liquid electrolytes.  The nanoscale origins of these unusual properties are investigated by studying how the ions arrange themselves near electrodes when variable voltages are applied, and how these arrangements develop and change with time.  These studies will develop the knowledge necessary to not just understand the observed properties of RTILs, but ultimately to design and control these behaviors.

The primary experimental probe is in situ X-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction from solid-RTIL interfaces, using national synchrotron facilities.  The dependence of the interfacial structure and its dynamics on the ions present, the nature of the electrode surface, and on applied direct and alternating voltages, are being studied and compared to existing theoretical predictions.

Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. Contemporary science education reforms consider modeling as a means to understanding science ideas and as an essential scientific practice to be learned. Modeling is the practice of developing and refining representations (or ""models"") as analogs of scientific phenomena. Important to the practice of modeling is the idea that, as an analog, a model draws out (or ""abstracts"") some as opposed to all aspects of a phenomenon. However, a well-known problem in modeling instruction is that leaners have difficulty understanding this essential point.  Learners often think of models as literal interpretations, or replicas, of what they represent. The investigators hypothesize that engaging students in a process of abstraction -- that is, drawing out common structures from multiple scientific phenomena -- during the creation (or ""synthesis"") of their own model will help students better understand the nature of scientific models.  Importantly, this approach will help students discover that a scientific model is not simply a literal interpretation, or replica, of any single phenomenon.  Sixteen teachers and their estimated 960 students from economically challenged communities in Georgia and Maine will participate in and benefit from the research study in the context of high school earth and environmental science classes. The project will develop a short instructional sequence and new student learning assessments that are implemented in earth science classes. The findings will help the field to understand whether the process of abstracting from multiple phenomena during model construction supports students' understanding of scientific models in relation to earth science ideas and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The project will provide professional development workshops to up to forty-six teachers over three years as means of recruiting research participants and to cultivate teacher leadership around the new approach to modeling. The developed products and the research findings will be shared with researchers, teacher educators, and teachers through science education journals and conferences. <br/><br/>This Exploratory Learning Strand research study builds upon prior work of investigators at University of Georgia and University of Maine by rigorously testing their hypothesis that that engaging students in the process of abstracting from multiple source phenomena during model synthesis supports more scientifically accurate understandings of the nature of models.  The research has the potential to (1) generate new knowledge about the potential value of abstraction as a guiding principle of learning about models and modeling practice; (2) identify ways in which specific classroom conditions, including teacher talk and actions, enable or hinder student learning about abstraction in models and modeling practice; and (3) demonstrate how teachers translate the modeling approach to other science disciplines they teach.  Teachers will be recruited through existing partnerships with schools and through professional development workshops offered to teachers nearby the two universities. To address the first two goals, the investigators will develop and test a two-part instructional sequence that addresses core ideas in earth science and the cross-cutting concept of scale. The first component of the instructional sequence is a typical model-based inquiry, and the second component requires that students abstract structures from multiple phenomena during the synthesis of their own models.  Twelve teachers and their students will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The treatment group will experience the two-part instructional sequence. The control group will initially not experience the second component, but will have an opportunity to do so at the conclusion of the study. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of classroom observations, interviews with teachers, student knowledge tests, student work, and teacher logs will be used to determine the effectiveness of abstracting during model synthesis and classroom conditions that enable or hinder students' learning when the approach is used. To address the third goal, investigators will document the experience of four teachers as they develop and implement a similar instructional sequence in other science disciplines, providing preliminary evidence on the broader utility of the synthesis-through-abstraction approach to modeling. A new research assessment for measuring students' understanding of the nature of models, core ideas of earth science, and the cross-cutting concept of scale may be broadly useful for future research on learning at the intersection of the three knowledge dimensions. Findings will be shared by traditional means, such as papers in peer-reviewed research and practitioner journals and conference presentations. Investigators will conduct professional development workshops for teachers in the third year to disseminate the products and findings of the research to practitioner audiences and to further cultivate participating teachers' leadership around this novel approach to modeling practice in science education."

Since composition of two linear maps depends on which of the maps acts first, this is a noncommutative mathematics setting where noncommutative analogues of basic mathematical theories are being developed. The principal investigator will work in two directions involving Hilbert space operators, following recent realizations in his research. On one hand the exploration of invariant properties of n-tuples of operators under certain types of perturbations leads to the study of the rings of operators which almost commute in a certain sense with the n-tuple. Connections to operator theory questions as well as to noncommutative geometry in the sense of Alain Connes are appearing. The second direction is in the area of free probability, the most noncommutative among noncommutative probability settings. Free probability, which was initiated by the principal investigator, has important connections to random matrices, combinatorics and to operator algebras. Via the random matrix connection, there are applications to certain models in physics and to models of multiuser communication systems. Recently the principal investigator found that free probability has an extension to a so-called bifree probability theory, which is a fast developing new area, with many open problems and which will also be part of the free probability problems studied.     <br/><br/>In more detail, the principal investigator will explore on one hand commutants modulo normed ideals of operators, smaller than the ideal of compact operators, which constitute a new operator algebra framework for the study of normed ideal perturbations of operators and on the other hand the bifree extension of free probability, to systems with noncommuting left and right variables. The operator theory questions involve obstructions to quasicentral approximate units relative to a normed ideal with diverse relations to almost normal operators, entropy and supramenable groups. The commutants modulo normed ideals are Banach algebras with involution of operators on Hilbert space, which have unexpectedly many relations to C*-algebras, like in the appearance of C*-algebras which are coronas of non-C*-Banach-algebras.  The K-theory aspects of these algebras are also of interest, for instance they provide a new angle on results about invariance of absolutely continuous spectra under perturbations . On the side of free probability and of its bifree extension the emphasis will be on the analysis, while other researchers emphasize the combinatorics. Trace-class commutators of hermitian operators appear both in questions about commutants modulo normed ideals and in free and bifree probability, with the possibility of being a point where the two subjects meet. The principal investigator expects to attract young mathematicians to research in areas of his investigations and in particular to continue organizing conferences and seminars about free probability, which has many connections to other fields in mathematics and provides good training for young mathematicians."

Not only are fault zones the sites of concentrated movement and seismic activity; they also form conduits by which fluids, magmas, and heat circulate through the Earth. A major unsolved problem centers on how the behavior of near surface faults relates to deformation in the deepest parts of fault systems, including the lowermost crust and upper mantle. Two of the most challenging aspects of resolving this problem are (1) a high degree of variability in the physical properties and behavior of faults at great depths and (2) there are few places on Earth that expose large tracts of material that once resided at depths below approximately 40 km and are available for direct study. This project utilizes one of only a few places on the planet where it is possible to directly observe the deep roots of an ancient fault system that once penetrated continental crust to depths of more than 65 km. Deep within Fiordland National Park, in southwest New Zealand, a near vertical fault zone up to 20 km thick can be traced continuously from areas that once resided at depths of 10 km to depths of 65 km during the Cretaceous time period. The research team, in collaboration with New Zealand researchers, will determine the internal structure, mineralogy, and behavior of this ancient fault zone at different depths and will show how the fault zone connects vertically through the crust and helped move, fluids, magmas, and crustal melts from mantle depths to near-surface environments. These are fundamental issues that are important to the understanding of all large fault zones, including those that occur with the United States and elsewhere. The project will also advance desired societal outcomes through an innovative, summer workshop program that provides research experiences to underrepresented students at minority-serving institutions in southern California, thereby promoting interest in research and graduate school opportunities. Providing graduate and undergraduate students with international field experiences and exposure to cutting-edge analytical research facilities will develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>An unsolved problem in continental tectonics centers on how competing weakening mechanisms localize deformation into faults and shear zones deep within the roots of continental arcs. This problem is especially acute in Cordilleran systems where episodes of voluminous magmatism, crustal melting, and high-grade metamorphism quickly change the compositional and rheological structures of the deep crust. The aim of this project is to determine how strain localization was achieved and sustained within the deep root of an ancient Cordilleran arc located in Fiordland, New Zealand during a cycle of magmatism and transpression. The project integrates transect maps, U-Pb geo- and thermochronology (zircon, titanite), and electron backscatter diffraction analyses to determine the following: (1) how competing weakening mechanisms localized strain at lower and middle crustal depths with a large transpressional shear zone, (2) how high-strain zones connected vertically across deep crustal boundaries, and (3) how temporal and spatial variations in magmatic, metamorphic, and deformational processes influenced shear zone development. The outcomes of this project will include a new 4-D model that shows how high-strain zones at different depths are physically connected within Cordilleran arcs, how strain localization is achieved and sustained within them, and how the deformation interacts with migrating magma and melts. This project is important because large faults and shear zones play a key role in the formation and evolution of continental lithosphere. They act as agents of weakening and hardening at different depths and they advect mass and heat through the lithosphere. One of the most challenging aspects of studying these features is determining their variability throughout the crust and mantle. Physical experiments, numerical models, and studies of xenoliths help us infer how materials deform at great depths, but polyphase flow laws for lower crustal compositions are scarce and no experimental studies of anorthite-diopside aggregates yet include melt in the deformation. In addition, few places expose large tracts of material that once resided at depths below about 40 km. To address these problems, this project involves a field-based investigation of strain localization mechanisms within the world's largest and deepest (up to 65 km) known exposure of lower arc crust. The project will provide new information on the geometry, composition, thermal evolution, and rheology of lower crustal shear zones that once penetrated the crust to depths of at least 65 km.<br/><br/>The Tectonics Program (Div. of Earth Sciences) and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering are supporting this project."

An instrument to do this work does not currently exist.  Such an instrument is important because it will facilitate college administrators monitoring progress in this area. It will also lead to the identification of opportunities with regard to making local STEM learning environments more supportive from the perspectives of undergraduate students in general.  The research team will survey students at three institutions to assess their local environments, provide data-driven evidence for interventions tailored to the unmet needs of the target population, and monitor progress relative to effectively supporting students.<br/><br/>Student-retention theories traditionally focus on institutional retention, even though efforts to support STEM students occur at the college level. The proposed study will bridge this gap between research and practice by extending and empirically testing the Model of Co-curricular Support (MCCS), which specifically focuses on supporting and retaining underrepresented groups in STEM.   The project will extend a prior student-retention theory to provide evidence that STEM researchers, educators, administrators, and policy makers need for informed decisions to improve STEM learning environments and design effective programs, activities, and services. The project will enable institutions to gauge the effectiveness of their institutional support for undergraduate STEM students, including those from under-served populations.  The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, extensive, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development."

Waves are moving oscillations, which can propagate in many substances. In some substances waves are easily visible, in some they are easily manipulated, and in some the waves attain a large displacement so that they take on a different character called nonlinearity. Attaining all three of these characteristics at the same time is possible in a substance called a dusty plasma, which is a mixture of highly charged micron-size solid particles immersed in a partially ionized gas consisting of electrons, ions, and neutral molecules.  In this project, large amplitude waves will be observed using video microscopy and manipulated using an experimental instrument on the International Space Station. An undergraduate student will carry out the analysis. The topic has an overlap with other fields of research including nonlinear dynamics as well as other plasma physics areas outside of dusty plasmas.<br/><br/>The data to be analyzed are mainly from the PK-4 instrument, which is a European-Russian apparatus now on the International Space Station. Data returned to Earth are distributed to scientists at other locations including The University of Iowa. A scientific video camera images a cross-section of a cloud of polymer microspheres, which are electrically charged due to their immersion in a weakly ionized plasma. This so-called dust cloud sustains waves such as dust acoustic wave and ionization striations; these waves grow naturally, by an instability, to attain nonlinear amplitudes. The use of data from PK-4 is valuable because under microgravitiy conditions, the dust cloud fills a three-dimensional volume of greater size than is possible in laboratory experiments on Earth. To support this effort the investigators will collaborate with theorists in describing the nonlinear motion.  This award to support an undergraduate student is made under a ""NASA/NSF Partnership on Science of Dusty Plasmas: Utilizing the PK-4 Facility on board the International Space Station"" and is complementary to a NASA award made under the joint program."

This is because color information is more reliable than other kinds of visual cues like an object's brightness.  Despite the widespread use of color by animals to advertise to potential mates and to warn predators against attack, scientists know very little about the way color vision works in most organisms, including why color vision differs between males and females in some species.  This project aims to examine vision in a group of toxic butterflies that display a new form of coloration on their wings, ultraviolet-yellow, and have novel violet and ultraviolet photoreceptors in their eyes. This project will identify key parts of their genome which control eye development and the placement of photoreceptors in their eyes, which differ between the sexes.   The differences in ability between males and females to detect color will be studied using behavioral tests and linked to cues in the butterflies' light environment which contribute to their survival and reproduction. In addition, this project will result in the training of the next generation of scholars - graduate and postdoctoral students in physiological methods, which will permit the recording of an animal's response to light. Undergraduates will be trained in the annotation of genomes. Lastly, the project will make freely-available a method for increasing the production of difficult-to-study light-sensitive proteins, which may be useful for a variety of biotechnology applications. <br/><br/>Mimetic animal coloration evolves in the context of predator confusion. Unless mimetic animals have adaptations for discriminating between mimetic colors there is a risk of confusion for the animals themselves, with negative consequences for mating and reproduction. Heliconius butterflies are of interest because many unpalatable species have formed mimicry rings in the Neotropics. The research team has discovered that Heliconius eyes express duplicated ultraviolet (UV) opsins and have shown that this duplication may be an adaptation for species recognition, via enhanced UV color vision. The proposed project will permit the elucidation of the biological significance of the ultraviolet opsin duplication by tracing species- and sex-specific patterns of photoreceptor evolution using immunohistochemistry, character mapping, and ancestral state reconstruction. In addition the project will draw on a Heliconius butterfly reference genome together with other genomic resources and transcriptomic resources that the project will generate, to identify eye genes that may have been the target of selection in these different lineages along with the duplicate UV opsin gene. The proposed work will reveal in unprecedented detail the evolution of color vision within a group of closely-related butterflies in relation to the signals they encounter in their daily lives. Whereas there has been much work on sexual dimorphism in signals, there is virtually no work on sexual dimorphism in sensory systems especially in color vision. This is a major gap that we can now begin to fill using a variety of methods: Pac-Bio and Illumina DNA-sequencing, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, intracellular electrophysiology, cell culture, and behavioral tests."

The research team will compare rubric ratings and outcomes to its own assessment of scholarly production, impact and teaching quality, extracted from candidates' CVs. Also, video-recordings of the candidates' formal job talks will be analyzed to determine social interactions, such as the number and tone of questions and interruptions, which may vary depending on whether the candidate is male or female. Study 2 surveys advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and newly hired faculty to examine if men and women self-report being treated differently during academic STEM interviews, and to determine if men and women react differently to similar interview events such as interrupting. Study 3 surveys early career scholars to determine their perceptions of discipline-specific understandings and stereotypes about merit and how these perceptions may or may not affect how they navigate their own interview processes.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

Bivalves have high commercial value as seafood, and provide important ecosystem services, such as clearing water, stabilizing soft sediments, providing habitat and serving as prey to larger animals. A single bivalve can filter several liters of water each hour, selecting the most nutritious particles to optimize energy gain and rejecting undesirable silt and debris. While this general process has been known for decades, understanding the mechanisms bivalves use to accurately sort particles is key to understanding the role bivalves serve in complex coastal food webs. This project will investigate how bivalves identify and select their food particles. It is hypothesized bivalve feeding structures identify specific molecules on the surface of food particles. These molecular factors will be characterized using several state-of-the-art analytical tools. The project will provide research training to postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The project will also establish a series of outreach events organized in partnership with a public aquarium to introduce the general public to hot topics in marine research, including the importance and sensitivity of marine resources. Overall, the results and educational initiatives will contribute to the promotion of science in general and to improved stewardship of coastal natural resources. <br/><br/>This project will identify biochemical cues and underlying regulatory mechanisms that mediate particle sorting in suspension-feeding bivalves. Based on preliminary findings, the central hypothesis is that particle sorting in these animals is controlled by interactions between microalga cell surface carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) present in mucus covering bivalve feeding organs. Using complementary molecular and physiological approaches and techniques, the bases of particle selection at the levels of the cell, organ and species will be probed and the major factors that mediate particle sorting will be elucidated. Several lines of research have been developed to (1) evaluate whether carbohydrate-protein interactions represent a main driver for sorting across suspension-feeding bivalves, (2) identify microalgae carbohydrates driving selection, (3) determine the functional role of carbohydrate-binding proteins in particle sorting, and (4) assess how these proteins are regulated. Findings from this project are expected to transform the field by (1) validating a novel concept establishing the role of carbohydrate-protein interactions to provide particle sorting on-the-fly, by (2) generating data needed to develop a mechanistic model for particle sorting in bivalves, and by (3) supporting a new dimension for the role of some evolutionarily-conserved lectins in the Metazoa. Altogether, this new information is highly needed to unravel interspecific interactions that regulate pelagic-benthic coupling and energy flow in coastal systems."

While the cold, wet environment is clearly important, the biological factors that cause so much peat to accumulate in these ecosystems are not entirely understood. This project will study how changes in peat carbon cycling at the Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research site vary with nutrient availability.  Researchers will conduct experiments to test hypotheses concerning the importance of algae and the food web of insects and invertebrates that algal production supports, to accumulation of carbon in peatlands. Food webs are a poorly know aspect of peatland ecology, and a better understanding of what controls biotic interactions within them will have profound implications for understanding the global carbon cycle. In addition to charting new conceptual ground in ecosystem science, this project will support two early career researchers, involve undergraduate students from under-represented groups, and train two graduate students.<br/><br/>This Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project challenges the notion that energy flow within the food web of boreal peatlands is limited to detrital pathways. Through a contribution of carbon subsidies and by modifying redox potential for heterotrophic microorganisms, the investigators propose that algal photosynthesis fuels a microbial loop and contributes to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen fluxes. The research will evaluate the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down effects (and their interactions) on boreal peatland food webs using a factorial experiment to test three hypotheses: 1) Under low nutrient availability, algal biomass is constrained and decomposition is primarily regulated by detrital pathways. 2) Increasing nutrient availability promotes algal biomass and the transfer of energy to grazers, releasing higher trophic levels from resource limitation. 3) The presence of a second energy pathway in algae (edible vs. inedible) mutes the trophic cascade, leading to greater stability (i.e., lower coefficients of variance) in food web structure than would be expected with strong top-down control of a homogenous edible community."

Residual stresses (nominally force divided by area) are caused by internal forces that remain even after all external loads are removed. Despite the fact that residual stresses can reduce the service life considerably, comprehensive and practical methods to determine them without destroying the parts do not exist. Current non-destructive techniques allow their quantification on the surface of the parts only. Thus, development of new materials or manufacturing techniques can be greatly helped by a thorough estimation of residual stresses that might develop during the processes. For example, residual stresses are extremely prevalent in additively manufactured parts and strongly depend on process parameters in a complex way that are not understood well. This award supports fundamental research in inverse computational methods based on the mechanics of materials to estimate residual stresses in both non-destructive and destructive fashions from the measurement of forces and surface displacements. Advancement in residual stress analysis will promote both opportunistic use and mitigation in the development of new materials and manufacturing processes, which will greatly enhance automotive, aerospace, defense, and nuclear industries. The research team will also promote engineering and education through participation in the summer camp programs that will involve female and underrepresented high school students.<br/><br/>For the development of the non-destructive approach, surface displacements will be measured cost-effectively on varying part sizes using digital camera images to trace speckle patterns. Mechanics-based mathematical algorithms derived using adjoint equations will be implemented to infer residual stress distribution from these measurements. Validation on a 3D printed rubber like material will be conducted. For the development of the destructive approach, very thin sectioned samples will be retrieved from the polycrystalline specimens to relieve all residual stresses, with the implication that the thin slices will deform as a result. Subsequent loadings of the samples will be used to determine the heterogeneous, anisotropic granular microstructure of the material using mechanics-based mathematical models. Application of reverse deformation on the now known microstructure to retrieve the original configuration can then be used to predict the residual stresses in the given section of the material. The fundamental scientific issue underlying both approaches is: What are the minimum number of experimental data sets and deformation modes, i.e., experiments, required to uniquely map residual stresses?"

Climate, weather, and aquatic ecosystems such as streams and lakes are intimately connected to each other.  This is especially true in mountain regions where glaciers as well as permanent and seasonal snowpack have major effects on physical (temperature), chemical (nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus), and biological (microbes, algae, fish) features of streams and lakes.  However, mountain environments are experiencing very rapid changes in climate, even more pronounced than global averages. Since mountain regions are like humanity's ""water towers"", we need a better understanding of what these changing environmental conditions mean for the quantity and quality of our water supply.  To best advance this understanding, scientists in different regions need to compare their findings and share their best practices of analysis and discovery. This project will support an intensive interdisciplinary workshop in which scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from the USA and China will meet to share data, develop collaborations, and make plans for further work to advance our understanding of how a changing alpine environment might affect lakes and streams and thus our water resources.<br/><br/>Ongoing climate variation is having major physical, chemical, and biological impacts on global ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems in mountain regions are especially impacted due to amplified temperature increases observed at high elevation and due to the sensitivity of key cryospheric components (glaciers, snowpack) to changes in temperature and precipitation. The ongoing changes in the cryosphere are widespread, complex, and affect a variety of key parameters for alpine lakes and streams such as temperature, transparency, discharge, and nutrient supply. The roles of natural variability versus external forcing in driving observed changes in snow and glacier distributions, as well as high elevation energy, water, weather, and biogeochemical cycles, need to be investigated. Documenting, understanding, and forecasting these impacts is challenging and requires broad interdisciplinary collaborations. To address these global challenges, this workshop will bring together experts in limnology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and hydrology as well as data science and mathematical modeling from both the USA and China to coordinate research, share key findings, identify major unanswered questions, and establish a network for future collaboration.

Some of the most interesting diversity involves ecomorphs, which are different species that have evolved to have similar body forms and behaviors that adapt them to the same ecological niche. It is known that the same ecomorph often evolves independently many times, but little is known about what explains overall patterns of ecomorph evolution. For example, is evolutionary change between some ecomorphs more common than others, and what explains these differences? In this project, a new, integrative approach will be developed to explore these fundamental questions about evolution, using frogs as a model system. The approach combines reconstructing species ancestry, (i.e., their evolutionary relationships), with data on species ecology, body morphology, physiological performance (how well they jump, swim, and climb), and their geographic distribution. This study will provide the first exploration of how these different factors explain large-scale patterns of ecomorph evolution across this major group of organisms. To address these factors, the investigators will develop statistical tools that can be applied to any group of organisms. General questions about the methods used to reconstruct evolutionary trees with genetic data will also be addressed. This project will support training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in a diversity of disciplines and techniques. The training will also include a summer undergraduate research experience, with students recruited from historically underrepresented groups. Outreach talks and a video on the project's goals, results, and implications will be delivered to public audiences. <br/><br/>This project has two major objectives. First, a new large-scale phylogeny of anurans will be developed, using new phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements and existing supermatrices. Urgent and general questions about the methodology of phylogenomic analyses will also be addressed. Second, the investigators will estimate patterns of transitions in ecomorphs and test the factors that explain these patterns. Specifically, researchers will collect morphological data from museum specimens for ~2,500 species.  They will also collect new performance data for 65 targeted species from North America, Europe, Africa, and Madagascar, and add this to their existing performance data for 63 species from Asia, Australia, and North and South America.  Data will be obtained on microhabitats and analyzed in the context of the new phylogeny to estimate transition rates among microhabitat-associated ecomorphs. Several hypotheses will then be tested about why transition rates differ among ecomorphs, including hypotheses related to ecomorph morphology, functional performance, diversification rates, and biogeography. Data will come from the scientific literature, specimens from scientific collections, and fieldwork in North America, Europe, and Africa."

To mitigate and properly react to this threat, society needs accurate predictions of future sea-level variations. The largest uncertainty in these predictions comes from estimating the amount of ice that melts from polar ice sheets, especially from the West Antarctica ice sheet. Right now, scientists estimate the mass variations of ice sheets in two ways. The first way is using airplanes and repeated flybys to monitor the variation of ice sheet topography and estimate the gain or loss of ice. The second way is using satellite measurements to track gravity fluctuations that correlate with the variation of ice sheet volume. Both techniques work, but both have limitations including cost and resolution. This project uses a passive seismic monitoring method to estimate the change in weight of the ice pressing on the Earth's crust. One advantage of this seismic method is that vibrations are recorded continuously; therefore, it is possible to monitor the changes of the ice sheet with better temporal resolution. The sensitivity of the seismic waves also provides a picture of the structure of the interface between the ice and the rocks beneath the ice, where most of the dynamics and changes of the ice sheet take place. This information is difficult to obtain with other methods. In this project, the researchers will process and analyze previously acquired seismic data from the POLENET-ANET array, measuring variations in seismic wave speed through time to assess the amount of ice lost or gained. They will also determine important information about the mechanical properties at the ice-rock interface. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar to develop this new branch of seismological research and more generally the field of environmental seismology. This project will also support the education of a PhD student who will work in close collaboration with the postdoctoral scholar and the two researchers.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The researchers plan to monitor ice-mass variations in the West-Antarctic ice sheet by measuring and interpreting seismic velocity changes in crust beneath the ice sheet. This project will extend similar work already completed on the Greenland ice sheet, where ice-mass fluctuations were found to lead to poroelastic changes in the crust and modify the seismic-wave velocity. This investigation uses a passive seismology method, whereby repetitive seismic noise correlation functions are computed from records of Earth's ambient seismic noise field. Measurements of the temporal changes in the correlation functions are made and then related to variations of the poroelastic properties of the crust. The physical model for the relationship between ice-mass change and surface-wave velocity change has previously been verified using GRACE satellite data in Greenland. This project will specifically focus on the recent rapid ice loss in Western Antarctica using data from the POLENET-ANET seismic network. A comparison between the ice-sheet behaviors in Greenland and Antarctica will provide clarification about the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed seismic velocity changes. This new method will be a transformative approach to monitor ice sheets with the potential for much higher spatial and temporal resolution than existing methods. The fact that this method relies on seismic waves makes the approach completely independent from other modern ice-sheet monitoring techniques."

Much of our understanding of earthquake nucleation is the result of laboratory rock mechanics experiments, but the laboratory-based models are difficult to apply to observations of natural earthquakes. This project brings together field recordings of earthquakes in Oklahoma and large scale laboratory experiments with the goal of linking both sets of data to identify a physical model of earthquake nucleation that can be tested with seismic observations. Larger than most laboratory experiments, the meter-sized samples are instrumented with a laboratory version of a seismic network, so a more direct comparison can be made to seismic recordings made in the field. A better understanding of the earthquake nucleation process will help us understand why earthquakes occur, how to avoid them, and how to better interpret seismic clues such as foreshocks.<br/><br/>The most commonly cited model of earthquake nucleation proposes that earthquakes do not begin instantaneously but are preceded by slow slip. However, the model's seismic implications are unclear, and its applicability to crustal conditions is debated. The proposed laboratory experiments allow the direct observation of the nucleation of magnitude negative three earthquakes under controlled conditions. The meter-sized sample is instrumented with arrays of sensors that can record both slow slip and any seismic signatures of the nucleation process including magnitude negative seven foreshocks and initial P-wave seismograms. This project will then rigorously interpret seismic data collected in north-central Oklahoma within the context of physical models of earthquake initiation and seismic/aseismic interactions developed in the laboratory."

As a consequence, this project has the potential to inform actors in the legal system about ways to limit bias in expert decision making.<br/><br/>This project will employ surveys and experiments designed to document biases of experts, and their perception of those biases. Further, it will examine differences that experts and non-experts have with respect to their biases. The focus will be on experts in the legal field, including forensic mental health and fingerprint identification experts. The project will test the hypothesis of ""bias blind spot,"" which is the tendency to recognize bias in others but not oneself. Thus, the project is designed to compare any bias blind spots of experts with that of non-experts. Surveys of experts and non-experts in various fields will be utilized to document experts' and non-experts' bias blind spots. Then, the project will employ experiments that measure experts' actual susceptibility to various biases and their awareness of those susceptibilities.

These single-celled organisms are ubiquitous in the world's oceans and live either in the upper water column (planktic) or on the sea floor (benthic). After their life-cycle is completed, the sand-grain-sized calcite shells are fossilized and contribute substantially to marine sediments. This rich fossil record, combined with the well-studied relationship between environmental parameters and shell-chemistry, make foraminifera a primary climate archive. While chemical and isotopic data collected from benthic and planktic foraminifer shells provide a largely consistent record of the Earth's past climate variability, these paleorecords may be slightly biased, as the chemical composition of fossil shells may be modified after being deposited for millions of years in the sediment column. A precise assessment of this bias could significantly improve critical applications of societal importance such as model simulation of past sea level or ice sheets, as these models strongly rely on the quality of paleoclimate data.  This project will apply advanced technological analytical tools to document the magnitude of this bias in chemical composition resulting from alteration of fossil shells. The project will support and train a female graduate student in the research.  Project outreach activities include museum quality displays for the Lamont Core Repository and Open House.<br/><br/>Previous studies suggest that certain domains within foraminifera shells are better preserved than the remaining material, and thus provide a robust record of past environmental parameters. However, these well-preserved domains are inaccessible by conventional analytical approaches that require analysis of whole shells. Thus, conventional ""whole-shell"" data represent the averaged chemical composition of different generations of shell calcite from a potentially large preservational range. Recent innovations in the combined use of high-magnification imaging by scanning electron microscope (SEM), cathodoluminescence (CL)-spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) now allows the identification and chemical analyses of both well-preserved and altered domains in single foraminifera shells. This project will apply this state-of-the-art approach on benthic foraminiferal shells from climate events relevant for climate model simulations, such as the last glacial-interglacial intervals and the Mid Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP), a potential climate analogue ~3.2 - 2.9 m.y. ago. This study will provide model simulations with more robust paleoclimate data, further, a comparison with conventional measurements will permit quantification of the potential bias in published records and thus establish corrections. This is the first study investigating potential alteration in benthic foraminifera with an unprecedented level of detail, and the anticipated outcome will be the compilation of more accurate paleoclimate records, which have a direct impact on the performance of model simulations for long-term forecasts."

Electronic structure theories, particularly represented by Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), have been developed into workhorse tools with a wide range of applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology.  High fidelity electronic structure simulation requires the solution of increasingly larger and more complex problems.  Efficient, accurate, and scalable numerical methods can transform the range of applicability of electronic structure theories and enable scientific applications that are beyond reach today.  The education component of this project focuses on introducing electronic structure theories to graduate students, early career researchers, and advanced undergraduate students with mathematical backgrounds. Efficient techniques developed in the applied mathematics community, after adapted to specific computational problems, can be valuable tools to reduce the cost of electronic structure calculations. Electronic structure theories can also offer new ideas and application areas for the development of general mathematical and numerical techniques. Currently there is a high language barrier between the applied mathematics community and the electronic structure community. This project will develop new education activities, such as new topic courses and summer school activities, with the goal of reducing the language barrier and bridging the gap between the two communities.  <br/><br/>The research component of this project aims at significantly reducing the computational cost for KS-DFT calculations with high fidelity hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. Mathematically, hybrid functionals involve the Fock exchange operator, which is generally nonlocal and full-rank, and its treatment is computationally very challenging.  This project will develop an adaptive compression strategy for treating the Fock exchange operator, and accelerate two important types of calculations with hybrid functionals: ab initio molecular dynamics, and real-time time dependent density functional theory.  The new methods will be transferred to community electronic structure software packages used by chemists and materials scientists, and be validated by simulation with real materials. The goal is to transform how hybrid functional electronic structure calculations are performed for large, complex systems."

Although women's share in STEM employment has been growing in non-computer science occupations, their share in computer science occupations has been declining since the 1990s.  Because computer science occupations account for 50% of STEM workers, this decline is slowing the growth of women?s share in STEM fields overall, and suggests significant untapped potential that could improve US productivity and competitiveness.  One reason that women may not seek out or remain in computer science fields is that they are treated differently than men during the hiring process.<br/><br/>This project uses a laboratory experiment in the field on first-line hiring managers to determine first if there is differential treatment of women in hiring recent computer science graduates. If there is such a difference, it will determine the characteristics of women who are more likely to be treated negatively as well as general characteristics of firms that are more likely to exhibit differential treatment.  Resumes will be randomly generated to include different characteristics that, if their inclusion helps women more than men, will indicate potential reasons for this differential treatment. The experiment will also use eye-tracking to determine how recruiters visually process computer science resumes and whether or not there are differences between how they process male vs. female resumes.  These combined results will help to differentiate between economic theories of discrimination, and will advance social science by increasing our theoretical understanding of when and how differential treatment occurs. Results from this study can be used to make recommendations to individuals applying for these positions and  institutions which advise them, to employers who desire to hire the best candidates, and to policy makers who want to increase meritocratic hiring in STEM.  The results will thus lead to a more diverse and competitive workforce, increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S.<br/><br/>This project combines two cutting-edge methodologies, eye-tracking and resume-randomization, to study gender discrimination at the first stage of the STEM hiring process. It will determine if there is differential treatment by gender in how first-line hiring managers treat resumes, whether the treatment is similar or different along the applicant quality distribution, and if there are industry characteristics (ex. firm size, industry code) that would lead to higher or lower levels of differential treatment.  Finally, this study will differentiate between different theories of statistical and taste-based discrimination.<br/>Technical recruiters in charge of first-line interview decisions will be solicited at university recruitment fairs and industry fairs to view and process hypothetical resumes for Computer Science majors. They will be asked to follow their standard hiring practice and to choose resumes to ?move to the next stage. The resumes will then be redisplayed and participants will rate each resume and give the expected starting salary and position. While participants are viewing the resumes, their eye-movements will be tracked via an eye-tracking device. Following the resume rating exercise, they will answer a short demographic survey.<br/><br/>Resumes with randomized inputs based on actual resumes will be created via a randomization program. Outcomes of interest include information on ratings, moving the resume to the next stage, position placement, salary ranges, time spent on individual resumes, time spent on and number of looks at specific parts of resumes. The coefficients and significance on the coefficient of gender determine whether or not there is differential treatment by gender, and if so, for which women and by what kinds of firms. Time spent on resumes by gender interacted with differential treatment findings provide information on use of heuristics in the decision-making process. Time spent viewing specific parts of the resume (areas of interest or AOI) and tracking the order that recruiters view parts of the resume provide insight into their decision-making processes. Gender interactions with randomized inputs that support or contradict stereotypes will be used to test employee taste-based discrimination and levels-based statistical discrimination.

The project engages a diverse group of undergraduate students in research in several areas of mathematics and mathematics education. The main goal of this program is to contribute to the development of human resources in mathematical fields by engaging undergraduates, mostly from non-PhD-granting institutions, in research that yields publishable results, produces conference talks and posters, and inspires the students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics, mathematics education, and other mathematically intensive disciplines. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the National Science Foundation.<br/><br/>Specific projects will vary from year to year. In pure and applied mathematics, typical projects will involve using computational tools or hands-on combinatorial arguments to investigate properties of basic examples that are expected to illuminate some larger part of the theory.  Topics are expected to include problems from sub-Riemannian geometry, stochastic processes, analysis and mathematical physics on fractals and disordered media, and mathematical finance. Projects in mathematics education will vary depending on student interest, but the anticipated focus is on creating and refining curricular and pedagogical tools that support students in constructing, communicating, and critiquing mathematical arguments as a means of enhancing both conceptual understanding and practical quantitative reasoning.  In addition to research experience, the program will give students practice in writing and presenting their work, teach them how to use software for mathematics (e.g. Mathematica and Matlab) and for writing mathematics (LATEX), and expose them to a broad range of mathematical topics through a weekly seminar series.  Workshops on the graduate school applications process and ethical issues in scientific research will also be provided."

Despite a wealth of literature on competition in psychology, economics and political science, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of competition between such organizations.  One would expect that sustained rivalries between groups can, in turn, lead to more general forms of violence against the population more broadly.  These expectations are counterintuitive given the amount of work - both academic and policy-based - that contends competition among non-state organizations can serve to reduce violence.  Conclusions of this sort have led political actors to adopt policies that might lead them to support one group in the hopes that it will destroy or distract a rival group.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The project addresses two remaining issues with respect to competitive dynamics among violent non-state actors in the field of international relations.  First, there is currently no large-scale dataset that provides detailed information on the competitive relationships between specific organizations. In this project, the authors develop a typology of rivalry along with a dyadic dataset that captures detailed information about the nature and intensity of intergroup rivalries over time.  Second, existing research overlooks the impact of multiple intergroup relationships on group behavior.  To address this omission, the research team utilizes both dyadic and social network analysis techniques to identify the effect of multiple simultaneous relationships.  This approach also allows them to examine to the ""co-evolution"" of violent behavior and the formation of rivalries."

As post-tornado disaster surveys have repeatedly revealed, tornado-induced losses and fatalities are often due to damage to low-rise buildings.  A critical factor contributing to such building damage is that many low-rise buildings are designed only for winds that travel mostly along a straight line near the earth's surface, and not for the rotating tornado winds that are potentially more damaging, primarily due to inadequate understanding of tornadoes and tornado wind loading on structures.  The goal of this research is to formulate computational models that comprehensively characterize rotating tornado wind loading and the impact of such wind loading on low-rise buildings. Such models can be used by engineers to conduct performance-based evaluation of low-rise buildings subjected to tornado hazard as a way to reduce damage and fatalities. To raise awareness of the impact of natural hazards, including tornadoes, on buildings and communities, this research will be integrated into education and outreach activities within existing programs at Texas Tech University (TTU), such as courses offered by TTU's National Wind Institute Wind Science and Engineering Ph.D. program and ongoing outreach activities, including a 4-H Mentoring Program, Science Camp, and Lubbock's Annual Severe Awareness Day.  <br/><br/>To achieve this research goal, this project will test models of low-rise buildings with two roof types in various types of tornadic vortices simulated in a large-scale tornado simulator at TTU and straight-line winds simulated in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) boundary layer wind tunnel at the University of Florida to provide two benchmark datasets. These two datasets will be used to quantify the differences between the loadings by tornado and boundary-layer-type straight-line winds. The focus will be placed on the effects of building internal pressure and the nonstationary and non-Gaussian nature of tornado loading introduced by the translation of spatially varying wind speed and static pressure deficit in tornado vortices. On this basis, an innovative approach based on discrete wavelet transform and Gaussian filtering will be used to characterize, model, and simulate nonstationary, dynamic tornado wind loading on low-rise buildings to enable probabilistic evaluation of the loading effects. Project data will be made available in the NHERI Data Depot at https://www.designsafe-ci.org/."

PAD is caused by a blockage (often due to atherosclerosis) of a major systemic artery such as the femoral artery that supplies blood to the leg.  Due to reduced blood and oxygen delivery to their calf and foot, PAD patients often develop pain when walking that progresses to pain at rest and eventual tissue loss, requiring surgical grafts or, in severe cases, amputation.  In addition to lost productivity and reduced quality of life for patients, the annual health care costs for PAD are estimated to be 160-300 billion dollars.  Currently, only two medications have been approved by the FDA for treating PAD-associated walking impairment, and both treatments are minimally effective.  The lack of sufficient data and understanding of the impact of different blood vessel adaptations on restoring normal blood flow following an occlusion motivates this research work.  A combined theoretical and experimental model will be used to design more optimal experiments, provide a mechanism for understanding the significance of adaptations to arterial occlusion within distinct vascular segments, and assist in designing more successful PAD therapies.<br/><br/>After a major arterial occlusion there is an immediate drop in flow, followed by a short (minutes), steep flow increase and then a gradual (hours to days) flow increase. However, the ability of the vasculature to regulate flow is significantly altered following a major occlusion, preventing full restoration of normal perfusion.  Vascular adaptations such as new vessel formation (angiogenesis) and existing vessel growth (arteriogenesis) have been observed to occur in response to a major arterial occlusion, but the relative roles and timing of each adaptation are unclear, making it difficult to extrapolate an optimal strategy for blood flow compensation.  In this project, a mathematical model will be developed to predict how short- (acute) and long-term (chronic) vascular adaptations impact flow after a major arterial occlusion.  The work will use a multi-scale differential equation model to couple the dynamics of the acute and chronic time scales and to assess the effects of hemodynamic and metabolic stimuli on the collateral and distal microvasculature following an occlusion.  Experimental data from the mouse hindlimb will be used to optimize model parameters.  To date, no theoretical model has been able to capture both the short and long term dynamics of flow following a major arterial occlusion based on mechanical factors affecting vessel diameter and number.  Such work will truly transform the current understanding of peripheral arterial disease by pinpointing the correct targets and timing for therapeutic agents that will help to restore normal perfusion in PAD patients.  The project also provides direct exposure of this interdisciplinary research work to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, thereby promoting the study of STEM disciplines among future generations and enhancing the scientific culture of our nation."

To achieve this, environmentally-friendly novel perovskite Cex(CH3NH3)1-xGeI3 will be synthesized with a facile, low cost approach to realize fortified<br/>stability and enhanced performance.  A simple device with p-i-n planar architecture will be constructed.  Lead will be replaced with germanium to minimize toxicity, and cesium partially incorporated to fortify stability. Meanwhile, the fundamental operative mechanism of perovskite solar cells will be elucidated by investigating cells with various configurations. The findings gained in the project will enrich knowledge in the photovoltaic field, facilitating the process of various practical applications and commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Particularly, the comprehensive understanding of the operative mechanisms will have a far-reaching impact on rational device design and optimizing device performance.

This project proposes to characterize and understand glutamate binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr), a member of the glutamate receptor family of proteins, with potential profound consequences for neuroscience and pharmacology.   However, the characterization of the configurational landscape of NMDAr is a High Performance Computing (HPC) problem.  It requires simulations with timescales and system sizes well beyond any that have previously been undertaken.  The project will use the petascale computing capabilities of Blue Waters to study such a system, using new sampling methods and original computing and data processing techniques.<br/><br/>The project will use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study this macromolecular system.  However, it remains a challenge to obtain an adequate sampling of the configurational space of complex chemical systems to accurately describe the structural properties of important substates, their relative propensities, and accessible transitions between them.  The project proposes to use a novel software framework that on the right computational resource makes a step-change in our ability to sample the conformational space of macromolecules by MD.  The project will study a protein of great biomedical relevance that exemplifies these issues, namely the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr).  The idea at the core of the software strategy is similar to many other multiscale methods -- such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, adaptive biasing methods, or transition path sampling: instead of one or a few long MD trajectories being run, many (hundreds or thousands) of short trajectories may be simulated concurrently.  Information is extracted from these very large datasets using sophisticated data reduction and analysis methods, and the coarse-grained information -- which embodies the chemical insight necessary to understand the system, e.g. an approximate free energy -- is used to refine the way in which further trajectories are generated (i.e., how we sample). Results from the analysis of the space sampled are then used in an iterative process to further direct the search of the conformational space (i.e., where we sample). This Blue Waters allocation will allow the project to access a total of 2.7 milliseconds of simulation of the NMDAr LBD system. With the three orders of magnitude (at least) speed-up in sampling allowed by our methodology with respect to plain MD, the project will be able to map the configurational landscape of this protein relevant for conformational dynamics up to a timescale of seconds, that is, to completely characterize the role of the ligand binding domain in the biological function and mechanism of NMDAr."

This technology has been used to identify areas of the genome that differ between populations occurring in different environments, and which may be important in preventing closely-related species from forming hybrids. This project uses similar methods to compare populations that differ in whether they co-exist with a close relative with which they can hybridize. The project focuses on orangethroat darter fish.  The project will identify genome areas associated with a preference to mate with one's own species, and test whether the same genetic changes happen in all closely-related species that coexist, or whether unique genetic changes occur each time. Data obtained from this study will provide critical insight into how differences in biological communities can drive species diversity. This project will provide valuable research opportunities and teaching materials for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used to educate community members about the biology of local native fish species. <br/><br/>Reinforcement plays a critical role in finalizing the process of speciation after secondary contact by increasing prezygotic isolation between taxa that produce unfit hybrids. As reinforcement directly selects for divergence in mating traits in sympatric populations, it can also incidentally lead to behavioral isolation among populations within species (i.e., cascade reinforcement). The objective of this project is to develop genomic tools to examine how reinforcement affects genome-wide divergence between and within species in two groups of darters (the orangethroat darter clade Ceasia and the rainbow darter Etheostoma caeruleum). Previous studies have provided strong behavioral evidence that reinforcement is driving behavioral isolation between sympatric Ceasia and E. caeruleum, and subsequently causing cascade reinforcement and behavioral isolation between species within Ceasia. This research will examine genomic divergence between species experiencing reinforcement, and investigate whether this divergence between species may incidentally be causing genomic divergence among populations within species (or among recently diverged species). Specifically, Next-Generation Sequencing will be utilized to (1) identify any differences in chromosomal structure between Ceasia and E. caeruleum that may be contributing to postzygotic isolation and facilitating reinforcement, (2) identify loci responsible for postzygotic isolation between Ceasia and E. caeruleum by genotyping hybrid and backcross individuals, and (3) conduct genome scans that compare genetic differentiation between multiple populations of Ceasia that are sympatric and allopatric with respect to E. caeruleum, in order to identify highly differentiated outlier loci between sympatric and allopatric populations that are likely associated with prezygotic isolation."

Through this type of training, early-career investigators will be able to develop future research directions that, in turn, will promote the advancement of the fields of petrology and tectonics. The conference will be held in the Washington State Convention Center, and will emphasize lecture-style presentations from experts in the discipline, and include a demonstration of data reduction software and possibly additional discussion time to identify areas of improvement of these methods. The first day will cover theory and analytical methods, and begin the systematic survey of relevant mineral systems. The second half-day will complete discussion of petrogenetically useful minerals and the presentation of useful software followed by discussion. Participants will be recruited from the broader communities interested in developing these new skills.<br/><br/>Petrochronology has emerged in the last 5-10 years as a preferred approach to geochronology, basically using chemistry and/or textures to integrate ages of individual crystals or crystal domains into a petrogenetic context. Examples in metamorphic systems include the use of crystal domain-specific trace element patterns or thermometers in minerals like zircon, monazite, titanite and garnet to link an age to an overall P-T-t evolution. Examples in igneous systems include resolution of crystal residence times, timing and rates of magma recharge, and rates of magma transport from zoning in quartz, olivine, feldspar, and melt (glass). Petrochronology directly benefits studies of tectonics, and metamorphic and igneous petrogenesis. It is expected that a corresponding book, published through ""Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry"", will provide an important foundation accessible to high-level undergraduate students, graduate students, and junior professional researchers who are interested in theory and applications within this burgeoning field."

It also couples the dynamical evolution of the stratosphere to the circulation near the Earth's surface on sub-seasonal and seasonal time scales. Chemical species of distinct tropospheric and stratospheric source regions are sporadically exchanged through the tropopause. The goal of this project is to study the dynamics of large-scale wave coupling near the tropopause waveguide, how this wave coupling is influenced by the background atmospheric thermal structure, and how it modifies the exchange of chemical constituents between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Different approaches will be used, including theory, observational data analysis, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>The results from this project will advance our understanding of climate- and weather-relevant processes in the tropopause region, including the processes behind the two-way coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere.

The project will furthermore improve our understanding of how the background atmospheric thermal structure near the tropopause influences exchange processes between the troposphere and the stratosphere. An improved understanding of the tropopause region is expected to ultimately lead to improved fidelity of models for weather and climate with corresponding societal benefits. The project will provide training as well as teaching and research experience for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, which will help prepare them for continued careers in science and/or education.

To date, there are no efficient semiconductor lasers operating in the deep visible (green and yellow) spectral range, which has been limited by the presence of large densities of defects in gallium nitride based materials. Consequently, the current commercial green lasers generally rely on the use of nonlinear optical conversion. Such devices, however, are bulky, heavy and expensive, and are not suitable for on-chip integration. Moreover, there has been no established manufacturable technology to spatially vary alloy compositions to achieve multi-color emission on the same substrate. As a result, the current solid-state lamps rely on the use of rare earth doped phosphors to down-convert the blue emission of a gallium nitride based light emitting diode (LED) to generate white-light, which limits the flexibility to tune the spectral power distribution and to achieve color-tunable emission. In this project, by using gallium nitride based nanostructures, the applicant will address these fundamental challenges and demonstrate small size, high efficiency multi-color lasers. This project will address the ""green gap"" in semiconductor light emitters and will enable phosphor-free solid-state lighting, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency, reducing the manufacturing cost, and improving the light quality. The broader impacts of this research also include the highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and the outreach to undergraduate, underrepresented minorities, and K-12. This project also provides the opportunity to educate the students involved in the research and to involve high school students on the science and technology of nanostructured materials, LED lighting, and photonics.<br/><br/>Technical: The applicant proposes to demonstrate white-color and full-color surface-emitting lasers through innovations in epitaxy, quantum-confined nanostructures, nanophotonics, and device engineering. Full-color emission will be achieved on a single chip by varying the nanowire diameters through selective area epitaxy, which was not previously possible for gallium nitride based quantum wells. Moreover, nonradiative surface recombination, one of the primary limiting factors for nanowire devices, will be addressed by using dot-in-nanowire core-shell heterostructures. In this project, surface-emitting lasers will be achieved by exploiting the two-dimensional band-edge resonant effect of a nanowire photonic crystal, instead of using conventional thick and resistive distributed Bragg reflectors. The unique approach will also enable the monolithic integration of red, green and blue emitters on a single chip, thereby leading to full-color and white-color laser diodes that were not previously possible. The device characteristics, including threshold, wall-plug efficiency, near and far-field profile, and modulation characteristics will be investigated."

Some tropical places are called ""hotspots"" because their local biodiversity greatly exceeds the biodiversity of other regions with similar climates. Madagascar is such a special place, with a tremendous number of species occurring only on this island, distributed within very small geographic areas. Part of the explanation of Madagascar's rich biodiversity is geographic isolation: long isolation from other landmasses has produced unique species across an island with high topographical and ecological diversity. But why do so many of Madagascar's unique species seem to occupy the same ecological role and yet occur side by side? This research will use ant diversity information from Madagascar to understand the processes that drive distribution patterns and organize insect communities. The results will provide insights into how species diversity patterns evolve, enabling us to both decipher the past and allow us to adapt to the future and respond to threats such as deforestation and habitat loss. This scientific study is accompanied by an extensive education plan integrating undergraduate students into a field research and outreach program to raise awareness on forest conservation issues both in Madagascar and the United States, and teach the skills necessary to monitor and conserve forests.<br/><br/>To investigate community structure and diversity patterns, as well as potential drivers of community assembly and species endemism, this study will utilize new phylogenomic tools and an unparalleled ecological data set for ants in Madagascar based on field inventories and collections conducted across the region by the researchers over the last 20 years. The objectives are to: (1) Assemble a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly 1,300 species of Malagasy ants. (2) Combine over 100,000 curated specimen records with climatic niche data to model species distributions for all Malagasy ants at 260 study sites. (3) Analyze and characterize patterns of ant community structure and diversity in Madagascar based on these genetic lineage and community data sets. In particular, the vertical stratification of ant communities in the canopy and leaf litter, as well as diversity along elevational gradients, will be examined. This large-scale community analysis aims to understand factors important in generating and maintaining species distribution patterns and endemism, and will allow us to draw widely applicable conclusions about the role of these patterns in community assembly. Beyond expanding the boundaries of scientific discovery, this research will (4) communicate arthropod, rainforest, and canopy biodiversity by educating public and scientific audiences through internships, workshops, video exhibits, and talks, and create extensive training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

To mitigate and properly react to this threat, society needs accurate predictions of future sea-level variations. The largest uncertainty in these predictions comes from estimating the amount of ice that melts from polar ice sheets, especially from the West Antarctica ice sheet. Right now, scientists estimate the mass variations of ice sheets in two ways. The first way is using airplanes and repeated flybys to monitor the variation of ice sheet topography and estimate the gain or loss of ice. The second way is using satellite measurements to track gravity fluctuations that correlate with the variation of ice sheet volume. Both techniques work, but both have limitations including cost and resolution. This project uses a passive seismic monitoring method to estimate the change in weight of the ice pressing on the Earth's crust. One advantage of this seismic method is that vibrations are recorded continuously; therefore, it is possible to monitor the changes of the ice sheet with better temporal resolution. The sensitivity of the seismic waves also provides a picture of the structure of the interface between the ice and the rocks beneath the ice, where most of the dynamics and changes of the ice sheet take place. This information is difficult to obtain with other methods. In this project, the researchers will process and analyze previously acquired seismic data from the POLENET-ANET array, measuring variations in seismic wave speed through time to assess the amount of ice lost or gained. They will also determine important information about the mechanical properties at the ice-rock interface. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar to develop this new branch of seismological research and more generally the field of environmental seismology. This project will also support the education of a PhD student who will work in close collaboration with the postdoctoral scholar and the two researchers.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The researchers plan to monitor ice-mass variations in the West-Antarctic ice sheet by measuring and interpreting seismic velocity changes in crust beneath the ice sheet. This project will extend similar work already completed on the Greenland ice sheet, where ice-mass fluctuations were found to lead to poroelastic changes in the crust and modify the seismic-wave velocity. This investigation uses a passive seismology method, whereby repetitive seismic noise correlation functions are computed from records of Earth's ambient seismic noise field. Measurements of the temporal changes in the correlation functions are made and then related to variations of the poroelastic properties of the crust. The physical model for the relationship between ice-mass change and surface-wave velocity change has previously been verified using GRACE satellite data in Greenland. This project will specifically focus on the recent rapid ice loss in Western Antarctica using data from the POLENET-ANET seismic network. A comparison between the ice-sheet behaviors in Greenland and Antarctica will provide clarification about the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed seismic velocity changes. This new method will be a transformative approach to monitor ice sheets with the potential for much higher spatial and temporal resolution than existing methods. The fact that this method relies on seismic waves makes the approach completely independent from other modern ice-sheet monitoring techniques."

Evidence from advanced industrialized democracies shows that when women participate in higher numbers as voters (e.g. after the extension of suffrage rights), it produces policy shifts in line with their political preferences. However, it is unclear whether similar outcomes result in developing contexts where women?s voting rights are guaranteed in the constitution as a result of elite, rather than popular consensus. In this project, the PI draws on evidence from a developing democracy with persistent gender inequality, to show that voting rights are at best unevenly exercised by women.  Certain additional conditions must be present for increased participation to produce improved representation: notably the independence of women's vote and the credible potential for collective action by women.  By identifying the conditions under which women's preferences are equally represented in policymaking, the project findings can inform policy aimed to achieve women's political equality and improve the representation of marginalized voices in politics.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>This project addresses a question that is central to political science theories of democratic representation and of substantive interest to policymakers and advocates for women?s rights: under what conditions does the equal exercise of a de jure right to participate produce de facto equality of representation for women? While this is a quintessential question in the study of democracy, rarely has it been examined outside the context of the developed world. This project fills this empirical gap by generating evidence on the actual content of women?s preferences in a developing democracy, and makes a contribution to democratic theory by identifying the conditions under which increased electoral participation by a group leads to more direct representation of their preferences in policy decisions. The PI uses original survey and behavioral data collected from citizens and representatives, supplemented by electoral and administrative data collected from government departments and data on women's mobilization collected from local NGOs to test the theoretical predictions. The PI also draws on semi-structured interviews with local government representatives, political party workers and civil society members to develop appropriate measures of key concepts and to contextualize the results of quantitative findings."

GaN-based blue laser diodes are widely used in optical information storage, in display, and in automobile lighting. However, to this day all the commercial blue laser diodes have relatively low efficiencies; in the best scenario only 1/3 of the input electricity is converted to optical laser output. A major and frequently overlooked issue is that the optical waves (or modes) within these laser diodes are not adequately confined for laser operation. In order to confine the optical modes effectively, layers with a sufficiently low optical index are needed to clad the emitted light, which has been very difficult to achieve. We propose to use a porous GaN layer, with a foam- or cheese-like nanostructure, as an effective confinement layer in laser diodes. Simulation results indicate that, due to a much-enhanced optical field inside the laser cavity, the threshold of blue laser diodes can be reduced by a factor of 3, and the overall efficiency can be boosted up to 60% or higher. Such an improvement will greatly extend the usage of blue (and near UV) laser diodes in applications such as chemical sensing, theater projections, and high-intensity lighting.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The purpose of this proposal is to provide a detailed analysis of GaN laser diodes (LDs), to overcome inherent material constraints through innovative nanoporous (NP) engineering, and to break the efficiency barrier of the state of the art (SOTA) GaN LDs. The efficiency barrier of the SOTA blue LDs (~30%) originates from fundamental constraints of the III-Nitride material system. In the III-Nitride material system, forming an effective waveguide with AlGaN cladding layers has proven to be a daunting task. The difficulties stem from (1) large lattice mismatches among III-N compounds for heteroepitaxy, (2) a low contrast in optical indices among III-nitride compounds, and (3) the tendency for layers to become electrically insulating as the Al-content increases. In this proposal a new, nanoporous form of GaN is exploited to address the aforementioned difficulties simultaneously. By using the NP GaN as cladding layers with an unprecedented tunability in optical index, a new degree of freedom becomes possible in optical waveguide design in an edge-emitting laser diode. The goal of this project is to demonstrate clear technological pathways to high performance blue laser diodes. The use of NP GaN introduces a new paradigm in LD design with (1) an enhanced optical confinement and therefore stimulated emission efficiency, (2) a reduced electrical impedance and an improved Joule efficiency, and (3) an enhanced light extraction efficiency. In principle, the enhancement of these three efficiency components will advance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LD to a power conversion efficiency of greater than 60%."

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to North Carolina A&T State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project focuses on developing a mathematical model to understand the mechanisms underlying deep brain stimulation, a therapy used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Undergraduate students as well as high school students will gain research experiences.  <br/><br/>The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease has been linked to the destruction of pathological rhythmicity in basal ganglia. To find a more effective deep brain stimulation procedure, it is crucial to use appropriate neuronal network models that are able to produce intermittently synchronized oscillatory dynamics observed in parkinsonian patients. As the only excitatory nucleus in the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in the dynamics of basal ganglia and is a standard target for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Recent experiments have identified a set of ionic currents that are responsible for various rhythmic bursting patterns in subthalamic nucleus neurons. This research will develop a new computational model for the subthalamic nucleus that comprises key currents and then set up network models, namely an updated basal ganglia network model and an extended cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus model. By performing numerical and mathematical analyses, the research will study how intrinsic neuronal properties and network properties in basal ganglia incorporate to generate intermittently synchronized rhythms. This project will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathological rhythms in parkinsonian basal ganglia and deep brain stimulation procedures. The research may also lead to the discovery of more effective methods to break the intermittently synchronized rhythms in parkinsonian states with a minimal amount of stimulation intervention."

Consequently, best practices for constructing lineups provide that suspects should not stand out from other lineup members. Yet, data has established that criminal suspects with facial features matching an African phenotype are more likely to be chosen from a lineup than those with less Black or African features. This puts innocent suspects with African facial features at risk of misidentification, especially if lineups are constructed with suspects having more African facial features than other lineup members. This project examines whether certain facial features influence mistaken identification of innocent suspects and correct identifications of guilty ones. It thus will provide information designed to improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification, as well as guidance to judges, attorneys, and jurors when evaluating the identification of phenotypically African suspects.<br/><br/>This project will involve a series of studies that examine how phenotypic facial features affect the accuracy of eyewitness identification. First, this project will test whether phenotypic bias (the tendency to view people with African features as criminal) in eyewitness identification is due to stereotype influence during the encoding of witnessed events, failures to use deliberative processes to correct for stereotype influence on judgments, or a combination of the two. This study also will test assumptions behind applied lineup theory, which suggests that automatic recognition processes lead to accurate identifications and deliberate processes introduce bias. These outcomes are in opposition to dual-process theories of stereotyping, which predict that phenotypic bias would influence judgments automatically and that deliberate processes would be required to correct for the biasing effects of stereotypes. Further studies in this project explore the interaction of phenotypic bias with factors that bias witnesses toward mistaken identifications. De-identified data from the project will be made publicly available. As a result, this project will test multiple theoretic foundations on lineups, as well as the potential mechanisms behind phenotypic bias, which may impair the accuracy of eyewitness identification."

Typically, two friends have a stronger relationship than do two strangers. The nature of the interaction also varies depending on the messages conveyed, such as when a truth versus a lie is told. A measure that captures the fundamental social dynamics between people is called interactional synchrony, and it reflects the extent to which the behavior of two or more individuals correlates within a short time window. Past research shows that interactional synchrony strengthens a relationship. However, a cohesive synchrony measure that captures multiple facets of behavior has yet to be tested. This project explores the role of deception in interactional synchrony in three different social constellations: individuals who have built rapport with a stranger, individuals who are friends, and individuals who belong to the same social organization. The synchrony between an interviewer and an interviewee, of varying levels of social relationship, will be captured when the interviewee lies and tells the truth about an action. The research uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze and uncover synchrony in the faces, vocal tones, bodies, postures, and sub-visible physiological responses of interviewers and interviewees. The results will inform the need to consider social ties in research on deceptive behavior and when assessing demeanor during real world interactions, such as interviews with criminal suspects or potential terrorists.<br/><br/>This project explores the role of deception in interactional synchrony in three different social constellations: individuals who have built rapport with a stranger, individuals who are friends, and individuals who belong to the same social organization. Interactional synchrony is expected to be higher for interactions that involve high rapport, closer friendship, and shared group membership. The deception scenarios involve both sanctioned and unsanctioned lying. The variation in interactional synchrony as a result of lying compared to truth telling within participants and as a function of truth/lie interactions with rapport, friendship, and shared group membership will be evaluated. The analysis of synchrony using computer vision and machine learning algorithms applied to different channels, ranging from more controllable behaviors, such as posture, to those less controllable, such as electrodermal responses, will enable a global interactional synchrony measure and also aid in the understanding of interactional synchrony as a concept, separating intentional mimicry from synchrony that is more automatic and unconscious. This refinement in the measurement technology of interactional synchrony will be of special value in detecting deceit, thereby contributing to the nation's security priorities."

This project brings these concepts and techniques to bear in a new field: large-scale distributed computing. The modern paradigm for large-scale distributed computing systems is driven by  ""scaling out"" of computations across clusters consisting of as many as tens or hundreds of thousands of machines. As such, there is an abundance of resource redundancy that can be exploited. This project develops a foundation for ""coded computing"", a new framework that combines coding with distributed computing to overcome several fundamental challenges limiting the performance of today's large-scale distributed computing platforms. The research outcomes of the project will be integrated into education and will be disseminated broadly. <br/><br/>This project takes a principled and foundational approach to providing a unified coding framework to tackle three key challenges in large-scale distributed computing: significant delays due to straggling nodes; large communication loads between computing nodes; and massive input data-sets. In particular, three novel coding concepts are proposed for distributed computing: coding for injecting computation redundancy to mitigate straggler issues; coding to trade local computation with global communication; and coding for statistically principled data sketching. The unified role of codes in both doing fast sketching and in providing robustness to straggler node delays and communication bottlenecks is also studied."

This workshop will bring together researchers in the area of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to study a promising new approach to solving QCD on the lattice that is expected to alleviate deficiencies of current methods. Developing reliable methods of calculating the properties of QCD is important, because QCD is the theory of strong interactions that binds fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons into protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei. If successful, the new approach will have significant impact on the experimental program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  <br/><br/>This workshop represents a good opportunity for junior researchers to further their training and improve their careers. To make this possible, NSF funding will provide partial travel support for junior scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend this workshop. The focus of this activity on new methods to solving Lattice QCD at finite density is expected to improve the understanding of experiments at relativistic ion colliders that study the quark-gluon plasma properties and the location of the QCD critical point."

All bacteria have cell envelopes with one or two membranes that play critical roles in cellular defense, communication, and structural integrity. Species in the Corynebacterineae have two membranes, the outermost of which is composed mostly of complex sugar-linked lipids called mycolic acid conjugates. This ""mycomembrane"" is unique to the Corynebacterineae and gives them distinctive physiological and pathogenic characteristics. Many aspects of the production, maintenance, and composition of the mycomembrane remain unknown because of the challenges encountered when using standard experimental techniques. This project generates and utilizes new chemical biology tools to characterize the structure and dynamics of the mycomembrane. The tools being developed form a significant part of the process of acquiring a better understanding of how the Corynebacterineae survive within and adapt to their surrounding environment. In addition, an investigation of this bacterial system advances understanding of the nature of interactions of bacteria with the environment and provides information that would enhance efforts to gain environmental control of pathogens. Undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows working on this research acquire interdisciplinary training in organic synthesis, microbiology and proteomics. This research is also integrated into an outreach program that introduces community college students to chemical bacteriology research and encourages their continued education in science. The tools generated in this project are expected to have broad utility and to support other scientists pursuing basic and applied research on the Corynebacterineae.<br/><br/>Traditional biochemical and molecular biological approaches are not well-suited to investigating the mycomembrane because it is made up largely of non-genetically encoded lipids and sugars. This research project develops chemical probes that exploit native metabolic pathways to introduce tags into specific mycomembrane components in intact bacterial cells. Tagged molecules are then imaged or identified by mass spectrometry, depending on the goal of the experiment. The probes developed in this project provide information on (i) how the major glycolipid constituents of the mycomembrane are synthesized and remodeled when the bacterium encounters stress; and (ii) what proteins reside within and contribute to the construction and maintenance of the mycomembrane. The findings from this project will lead to an improved understanding of mycomembrane structure and dynamics and provide insight into the physiology of bacteria in the Corynebacterineae suborder."

Unfortunately, researchers often lack the time, resources, and expertise to perfectly execute all of these activities. While requirements for data management have been in place for six years, many researchers are still not entirely clear on what a good implementation strategy should look like or what their specific responsibilities are with respect to data management. There are few good Research Data Implementations (RDMI) exemplars and a lack of common standards and practices. Data remains difficult to manage and reproduce throughout its lifecycle, and solutions are still carried out and implemented in a piecemeal fashion.<br/><br/>In March of 2013, an NSF-funded workshop on RDMI brought together 109 data management experts, with an additional 73 experts attending online, to discuss RDMI implementations as they relate to domain specific workflows and deployments. These discussions were very helpful to the scientific community. There is a broad community of researchers that would benefit from RDMI, but RDMI availability is currently limited to institutions and domains with the resources and specialized personnel to develop them. After 4 years, the scientific community would greatly benefit from an opportunity to come together again to reflect on what has been accomplished to date related to Data Management, share achievements and assess gaps and opportunities for further contributions, and contribute with suggestions for a future roadmap. We propose to organize a second RDMI workshop to be held in 2017. This new workshop will focus on:(a)the impact that RDMI have on science, (b) developing RDMI in partnership with research communities, and (c) increasing access to RDMI for the broader research community. Workshop organizers will invite submission of position and experience papers and encourage dialogue on these focus areas through talks, panel discussions, and breakout sessions. Individual case studies will be discussed and workshop participants, through breakout sessions, will offer feedback and suggestions that will aid in refining future RDMI implementations."

To that end, this research project will collect data about the experiences, beliefs, and praxis of Black mathematics teachers from historical and contemporary perspectives to: (a) inform recruitment and retention efforts; and (b) contribute to theory building. This study is highly important since the number of Black mathematics educators choosing to teach mathematics at the secondary are either choosing not to select mathematics as a career or leaving the profession due to racial/ethnic biases and stereotype threats that often question their ability to teach the subject. To help encourage more Black educators to choose teaching mathematics as a career, this study will document the oral histories and experiences of Black mathematics teachers pre- and post-de jure school desegregation as a means of informing contemporary recruitment and retention procedures and processes. It will also examine the experiences of practicing Black secondary mathematics teachers about their beliefs about mathematics content, recruitment, retention, racialized experiences in education, and perceptions and beliefs about current pedagogical practices. This information will be used to inform educational policy and provide implications for recruiting and maintaining a more diverse mathematics education teaching force. <br/><br/>A mixed methods research design will be used to collect data through oral history interviews with retired Black mathematics teachers and focus group sessions with current mathematics teachers. A large-scale survey will also be adapted and administered to capture the experiences of current Black secondary mathematics teachers from a sociocultural perspective. Through these data sources, this research will advance knowledge of the historical and sociocultural influences that impede recruitment and retention of a diverse teaching force by focusing efforts on understanding these issues in relation to Black mathematics teachers. It will also inform research methodology in STEM by integrating untapped, yet appropriate methodologies suitable for challenging issues of recruitment, retention, and praxis of other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups across time periods and school contexts. Further, this project will contribute to theories about the development of mathematics identity and mathematics teaching. This outcome, in turn, will help broaden participation of underrepresented teachers and students in STEM while improving mathematics achievement and performance overall. Through these avenues, findings from this research will reach a variety of academic and general public audiences through online digital portal and website that will provide informational and educational tools for the larger education community."

Over the past decade, a trauma-informed approach has become increasingly ubiquitous among non-profits and government agencies in the United States. Trauma-informed approaches are being implemented most vigorously in urban areas as a response to the negative aspects associated with urban poverty, including lack of physical and mental health resources, community violence, and housing instability. Trauma-informed approaches attempt to remedy these problems through therapeutic interventions and by making existing institutions and organizations more attuned to trauma. Via a critical geographic approach, this research will investigate how trauma-informed interventions are implemented at different geographic scales, i.e., individual, family, community, institution, or state, and what their effects are in urban areas. The project will contribute to ongoing debates in urban geography, and urban policy more broadly, about where the causes of and remedies for poverty are located. Because of trauma-informed approaches' concern for mental and neurobiological health, the project will also contribute to a growing literature in geography about the relationship between health and biology to social and spatial phenomena. In particular, it will look at how people's daily interactions with urban space and urban processes impact individual and community health, and the ability of trauma-informed approaches to effect city-wide change.  <br/><br/>Current research into trauma-informed approaches centers on the evaluation or implementation of specific programs and focuses on best practices in the field of social work and policy. Little is known about how trauma-informed approaches operate as an urban policy intervention and how they fit into broader political, institutional, and geographic shifts that have occurred in urban areas over the past several decades. This research seeks to fill that gap by documenting current, discourses, practices, and experiences of trauma informed approaches and bringing the empirical work in productive conversation with critical and urban geographic perspectives. To accomplish this, the study will proceed through ethnographic research, including key informant interviews, participant observations of trauma-informed professional trainings, and discourse analysis of trauma literature. The research will be carried out in the cities of Philadelphia, PA and New Orleans, LA. These cities will provide unique contexts for this research because Philadelphia is attempting to become the first ""trauma-informed city"", and New Orleans is implementing trauma approaches in light of the traumatic event and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. However, they are also like many urban centers in the US, having high rates of poverty, increased privatization of public services, and disproportionate neighborhood violence. By conducting a multi-sited ethnography, the research will situate trauma-informed approaches at the intersection of both theoretical and public policy concerns about urban poverty and healthy populations. Furthermore, findings about how trauma-informed approaches are being deployed by different organizations, at different scales of governance, and in different cities will be used to improve the practices of non-profits, governmental agencies, and other stakeholders in urban areas."

The high performance of these devices is enabled in part due to the use of high quality monocrystalline III-V materials and in part due to the coupling of multiple sub-cells that collectively allow for absorption of a broadband solar spectral range. However, the materials and manufacturing costs required for the development of III-V tandem junction devices is prohibitively high for use in wide-scale terrestrial consumer applications. As a consequence, the world's highest performance solar cells are limited to use in niche markets such as terrestrial high concentration and space power applications. A high-risk, high-payoff exploratory research path is proposed here that aims to provide an unconventional, yet potentially transformative nanotechnology-enabled solution to the above consumer market penetration challenges faced by state-of-the-art tandem junction solar cells. The project aims to dramatically reduce manufacturing costs by monolithically integrating III-V sub-cell composed of vertical nanowire arrays to a central silicon sub-cell, thereby simultaneously eliminating the primary III-V substrate cost-driver while cutting III-V crystal growth volumes by up to 95% compared to conventional technologies. The broader significance of this EAGER project lies in the potential realization of a low-cost and high-efficiency renewable energy innovation that provides greater national energy independence and clean power. This research also impacts and advances fundamental knowledge in science and engineering in the fields of physics, nanomaterials growth and characterization, nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics. Immediate anticipated societal impacts include outreach activities that promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts to the general public, training new members of a highly-skilled workforce, and direct inclusion of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from under-represented communities.<br/>	<br/>Technical:<br/>The technical approach of this EAGER project relies on selective-area heteroepitaxy of a GaAsP (1.75 eV) nanowire array on the top surface of a thinned Si (1.1 eV) sub-cell by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. A bifacial, three dissimilar materials, tandem junction device is formed via monolithic integration of a back-side InGaAs (0.5 eV) nanowire array. The vertical nanowires comprising the top- and back-surface arrays will contain radially-segmented p-i-n junctions and will be serially connected to the central Si sub-cell via epitaxial tunnel junctions. This design enables absorption of broadband incident solar energy as well as albedo radiation. Standard lattice-matching constraints are overcome via strain relaxation along nanowire free surfaces. Therefore, ideal spectral matching is realized without a need for graded buffer layers or dislocation mediation strategies. Use of vertical nanowire arrays with coaxial p-i-n junction geometries permits key advantages, including near-unity absorption of solar irradiance at normal and tilted incidence without the use of anti-reflection coatings, decoupling of photon absorption and carrier collection directions, and dramatic reduction of 95% in epitaxial volumes. Rigorous modeling of device parameters will be iteratively coupled with extensive materials characterization and property correlation experiments for optimization of III-V sub-cell structure on the single nanowire and ensemble array levels. The ultimate target of this work is demonstration of a functional bifacial, three dissimilar materials, nanowire-based tandem junction solar cell with one Sun power conversion efficiency of 30% or better."

Some tropical places are called ""hotspots"" because their local biodiversity greatly exceeds the biodiversity of other regions with similar climates. Madagascar is such a special place, with a tremendous number of species occurring only on this island, distributed within very small geographic areas. Part of the explanation of Madagascar's rich biodiversity is geographic isolation: long isolation from other landmasses has produced unique species across an island with high topographical and ecological diversity. But why do so many of Madagascar's unique species seem to occupy the same ecological role and yet occur side by side? This research will use ant diversity information from Madagascar to understand the processes that drive distribution patterns and organize insect communities. The results will provide insights into how species diversity patterns evolve, enabling us to both decipher the past and allow us to adapt to the future and respond to threats such as deforestation and habitat loss. This scientific study is accompanied by an extensive education plan integrating undergraduate students into a field research and outreach program to raise awareness on forest conservation issues both in Madagascar and the United States, and teach the skills necessary to monitor and conserve forests.<br/><br/>To investigate community structure and diversity patterns, as well as potential drivers of community assembly and species endemism, this study will utilize new phylogenomic tools and an unparalleled ecological data set for ants in Madagascar based on field inventories and collections conducted across the region by the researchers over the last 20 years. The objectives are to: (1) Assemble a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly 1,300 species of Malagasy ants. (2) Combine over 100,000 curated specimen records with climatic niche data to model species distributions for all Malagasy ants at 260 study sites. (3) Analyze and characterize patterns of ant community structure and diversity in Madagascar based on these genetic lineage and community data sets. In particular, the vertical stratification of ant communities in the canopy and leaf litter, as well as diversity along elevational gradients, will be examined. This large-scale community analysis aims to understand factors important in generating and maintaining species distribution patterns and endemism, and will allow us to draw widely applicable conclusions about the role of these patterns in community assembly. Beyond expanding the boundaries of scientific discovery, this research will (4) communicate arthropod, rainforest, and canopy biodiversity by educating public and scientific audiences through internships, workshops, video exhibits, and talks, and create extensive training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

Better understanding of how the social and technical elements of the financial system adapt to this jolt will advance our understanding of technology infrastructures in general and inform the design of accessible technologies and technologies for contexts where financial, educational, and technology experience resources are limited. Studying this in India will provide important insights for U.S. companies looking to enter the Indian market or already operating there, and will also offer key insights on prospects and challenges in broadening the cashless economy in the U.S. The project will also provide educational experiences that cross both intellectual and national borders that will help train a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Based on an integration of ICTD and infrastructure studies, this project will develop better understanding of how people adapt to technology in forced or deterministic contexts. The team will study and compare three different user populations: 1) college students; 2) people working in the informal sector; and 3) people with visual impairments.  These populations were chosen to highlight different aspects of the broader population: college students are less reliant on the cash economy and more educated; those in the informal sector are more cash-reliant and less educated; and those with visual impairments may gain transactional benefits from not having to handle cash, but also have to overcome inaccessibility of mainstream technology. The research will employ a two-stage plan that starts with interviews to capture nuance and inform questions that can be asked in a second, survey stage; the team plans to conduct the research twice, once in the first 6 months and again (with improvements based on the first round) in the last 3 months of the year-long project, to capture both relatively fresh and longitudinal experiences of the jolt.  Leveraging existing relationships with payment providers, visually impaired groups, and informal workers, the researchers will study the ecosystem of payment technologies people use, the ways their specific design affects people's ability to use them, and how their social network both supports (through intermediation) and affects (through network effects) the ways they can use those technologies. This will provide lessons for understanding and improving innovation and technology use in marginalized communities, lessons that may transfer to other contexts such as the rapid adoption of mobile health apps and the use of technology in natural disaster situations."

A nonlocal interaction can be illustrated by its contrast to a local interaction in a simplified picture of a population of agents (say, people) interacting across a shared network.  A local model is one in which people can share information only with their immediate neighbors, whereas a nonlocal model is one in which they can share information more broadly, possibly across an entire network, and do so instantly.  This simplified picture actually manifests itself in many situations in which a nonlocal paradigm is more fruitful than a local one, and the inclusion of nonlocal interactions often fundamentally changes the underlying mathematics that describe aspects such as the propagation of information.  This project aims to improve the study of such phenomena through the introduction of new mathematical tools.  Along the way, this project will support the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduates through involvement in research on these topics. It will also create new graduate course material that provides a more unified approach to nonlocal tools of use in treating certain current topics in data science.  <br/><br/>In the realm of mathematics surrounding nonlocal problems, there has been a surge of activity during the past twenty years.  Experts have found themselves addressing questions in roughly two categories: (1) What properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of nonlocality itself; and (2) what properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of integrating them with other fields?  In this project the principal investigators focus on the second type of question.  They aim to develop nonlocal tools that can be applied to some classical problems that are not, at first glance, necessarily nonlocal, including questions about oscillatory boundary-layer phenomena for elliptic equations and free-boundary problems of one or two phases. The key point is that there are powerful tools in the nonlocal world that could shed new light upon or produce new results for some of these equations that were not approached from this perspective earlier. Such tools include, but are not limited to, the fast growing regularity theory for nonlocal equations and theory of weak solutions for nonlocal equations (still in its infancy).  Through representation techniques for general (nonlinear) operators that enjoy a global comparison principle, the principal investigators hope to bridge the gap between some aspects of these previously disjoint classes of equations and to use this ""nonlocal"" bridge as a pathway to new discoveries."

Mid-rise buildings framed from thin-walled, cold-formed steel (CFS) have the ability to support this urgent need. The potential benefits of CFS-framed structures include low installation and maintenance costs, high durability and ductility, lightweight framing, and a manufacturing process using recycled material. In addition, consistency in material behavior, high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness, and use of a non-combustibile material are added benefits compared with other lightweight framing solutions. By using framing schemes with closely-spaced vertical members repetitively placed in the walls, CFS buildings develop lateral resistance through strap, sheet, or sheathing attached to these vertical members.

These interactions will take place at the 15th International meeting on Mechanisms in Plant Development, which will be held from July 30th to August 4th 2017 in Saxtons River, Vermont, USA. This meeting is the only regularly held international conference devoted entirely to plant developmental biology, the study of how plants grow and make different structures, such as leaves, fruits and grains, that are critical to our agricultural economy. Discoveries in developmental biology may help improve crop yield, quality and stress tolerance, as well as reducing needs for fertilizers and other inputs. This project is special because the small size and secluded location of the meeting make it a fantastic opportunity for discussion of new ideas and emerging concepts, as well as for developing professional networks. Half of the meeting time will be devoted to presentations from early career, women and underrepresented minority scientists. The results of the conference will be summarized by meeting participants and made available to the general public by postings on publicly accessible websites including 'The Node'. Materials will also be provided directly to participants to spread the exciting new findings presented at the meeting.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/><br/>This conference is an important and unique scientific meeting where the intersections of plant development, signaling, modeling and genomics are explored through talks, poster sessions, and intensive scientific discussion. The meeting includes outstanding researchers from around the world, presenting cutting edge research directed towards a fundamental understanding of how different aspects of plant growth and development are controlled in response to intrinsic and external signals, and how such mechanisms are modified over evolutionary time. This meeting will cover broad areas of plant development, including sessions on local and long-range signals, the interface between cell and developmental biology, new approaches to modeling development and plants emerging as new models for important developmental traits. This year includes more plant/environmental interactions (biotic and abiotic) because plant life histories combined with new technologies make plants especially well-suited to pioneer an understanding of the positive and negative interactions between a complex multicellular organism and the world around it. The conference will also promote education of a diverse group of scientists at all career levels. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty will be strongly encouraged to submit poster abstracts, and nearly half the speakers will be chosen from these submitted abstracts. Participation by underrepresented minority and female scientists will also be strongly encouraged; this will be achieved by identification and encouragement of individuals, by contacting networks and academic institutions that serve underrepresented minorities, as well as by advertising the conference widely. The results of the conference will be widely disseminated through a written summary posted online and slides to be used by meeting participants to spread the exciting new findings presented."

Understanding and eventually manipulating for crop improvement the key molecular mechanisms which plants use to defend against various pathogens is thus of considerable agricultural, economic, and social importance. Among the mechanisms pivotal for host defense is ubiquitination, a major post-translational protein modification process that occurs in plant, animal, and human cells. A particular type of unconventional modification of proteins by ubiquitin (lysine-63-linked ubiquitination, is well documented to be crucial in modulating human and animal innate and adaptive immunity. However, the roles of this type of ubiquitination in plant immunity and other plant physiological processes have been significantly understudied, even though this type of ubiquitnation is the second most abundant type of ubiquitination in plants. This project investigates the mechanistic basis of regulating plant innate immunity by this type of unconventional ubiquitination and includes education development for high school science teachers and minority undergraduate students and outreach to the Nebraska farmers and stakeholders.<br/><br/>Initial work of this project has identified and preliminarily implicated two tomato RING type ubiquitin ligases, Fti1 and Fti1B and their closest homolog in Arabidopsis, AtFti1 and AtFti1B, respectively in FLS2-mediated plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Fti1 and Fti1B and their Arabidopsis closest homolog were found to interact and work with UBC13 type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination and Fti1B and AtFti1B were shown to be functionally conserved in FLS2-mediated PTI.  Additionally, an isoform of AtFti1B was found to change subcellular localization to a yet undetermined organelle after PTI was induced by flg22 in the cell. In this project the investigators will elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of plant PTI by AtFti1B/Fti1B-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination, with aims to (1) determine the role of AtFti1B isoforms in PTI and the molecular outcome of AtFti1B-BAK1/FLS2 interaction; (2) elucidate the biological significance of AtFti1B-BAK1/FLS2 interaction, the E3 ligase activity of AtFti1B, and the AtFti1B subcellular localization in plant immunity; and (3) identify novel components that are involved in the regulation of plant immunity by AtFti1B-mediated Lys63 ubiquitination. Fulfillment of this project will help integrally address two important, yet elusive questions in plant immunity: what are the roles and mechanisms of Lys63-linked ubiquitination and cell organelles in plant immune signaling. Considering the limited knowledge of Lys63-linked ubiquitination in plant biology in general, findings from this project will also assist our efforts to understand Lys63-linked ubiquitination in other plant physiological processes. Integral to this project will be extensive education and outreach activities to train high school science teachers and minority undergraduate students that are underrepresented in science through a High School and Undergraduate Science Connect Promoting Keen Interests in Research (HUSKER) program and to educate Nebraska farmers and stakeholders about the importance of basic research in crop improvement."

This project is significant because it uses the community for learning science of the environment, in an approach called Citizen Science or Participatory Science Research (PSR). The project will target learning outcomes for underrepresented middle and high school students in the urban and diverse East San Francisco Bay Area. The fundamental issues that will be studied deal with particulate matter (PM) in the local area. The project will generate information that contributes to better understanding the impact of a science curriculum with PSR activities on science learning. The project will provide opportunities for students at a total of 10 different middle and high school sites to engage in a broad range of activities where the students will collect, analyze, and disseminate data generated in local urban communities. An accompanying curriculum that includes new and previously tested skills development activities also will be produced and used to aid students in connecting PSR activities to inter-related topics such as: energy generation and use, global climate, environmental degradation, and community health (asthma, in particular). <br/><br/>The project will refine a theory of learning that makes more explicit the connections between science practices, identity, and value and relevance. The project will yield information useful in the future development of effective learning environments in urban areas, providing positive science education experiences to challenge students' previous notions and ways of relating to science. The students will learn how to identify with science by gaining a deeper understanding of science practices. They will learn how to analyze and interpret data; construct explanations; engage in argument from evidence; and obtain, evaluate and communicate information. The students will be collecting air samples which will be analyzed using an electron microscope. In conducting their research, students will use low cost, highly accurate AirBeam particle monitors and tablet devices to measure and georeference PM concentration levels as they travel within their schools and surrounding communities. These measurements will then be used to assess ventilation conditions within school buildings, and correlated with different transit routes and transportation systems in an attempt to assess exposure patterns associated with different modes of transit in a given area. The result will be an increase in the understanding of the relevance and the value of science in everyday life. The project will also yield high quality particulate matter data that will be useful for local environmental efforts as well as to public health and atmospheric scientists."

Sea ice in the Southern Ocean has increased in area over the observational record but researchers have yet to agree on the cause. Researchers suggests that changes in surface winds, upper-ocean freshening, or internal ocean/atmosphere variability could be the main driver for the increase in sea ice area. This project will determine how much of the change in sea ice area from year to year is due to oceanic, atmospheric, and radiative processes. Reconciling the observation-based understanding with model representations of sea ice variability will improve confidence in projections of future changes in Southern Ocean sea ice.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to improve our understanding of the processes that drive Southern Ocean sea ice year-to-year variability and long term trends. This knowledge will provide insight into how Southern Ocean sea ice responded to greenhouse gas and ozone forcing in the past and how it will respond in the future. The energy budget of the coupled cryosphere/ocean/atmosphere climate system will be used as a framework to disentangle drivers and responses during sea ice loss events. The technique consists of: (i) calculating the coupled energy budget of the climate system at the monthly timescale, (ii) isolating the radiative impact of sea ice variability from the radiative impact of cloud variability in the observed satellite radiation record and (iii) analyzing the vertical structure of atmospheric energy transport to determine the vertical profile of energy transport into the atmospheric column. This framework will allow the investigators to distinguish whether ice loss events are triggered by oceanic processes, atmospheric dynamics, or radiative processes. Preliminary results show that a diversity of mechanisms can drive Southern Ocean sea ice variability in coupled climate models whereas observed sea ice variability appears to be dominated by atmospheric dynamics. The exploration of biases between models and observations in both the mean state and in specific processes will yield more accurate projections of the future of sea ice in the Southern Ocean. <br/>"

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Morgan State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project focuses on the development of numerical methods arising from many important applications. The research crosses the fields of mathematics, computational physics and material sciences. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain research experiences.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of numerical methods for variable-coefficient poroelastic models. The research will propose, analyze and implement several fast, optimal and scalable numerical algorithms for poroelastic models under the spatial discretizations including the finite element method, finite volume method and immersed interface method. Specifically, novel numerical approaches, such as preconditioning methods, Multigrid methods, domain decomposition methods, and the acceleration techniques for the conventional iterative methods, will be developed and investigated. The numerical algorithms will greatly improve the efficiency of poroelastic solvers. The research has the potential of improving the linear and nonlinear solvers for the conventional Finite Difference and Finite Element methods for poroelastic models in various applications. As an example, the developed numerical algorithms can be used in simulating energy storage in subsurface, which requires large-scale numerical computations; furthermore, the developed numerical methods can be applied to simulate a brain swelling model and therefore quantify brain edema assessment. Combined with image data and patient-specific data such as cerebral blood flow conditions, the numerical methods can be used for simulating brain swelling under ischemic conditions or after traumatic brain injury. The algorithms will be implemented as open source software packages."

At the same time, physics departments face several challenges: Physics acts as a gateway for physics and engineering careers, yet it is among the least diverse of all science disciplines and widely used traditional teaching methods do not yield learning increases commonly obtained with newer methods. There is an abundance of research-based pedagogies that have demonstrated improvement in learning gains and student retention - especially of underrepresented groups, but unfortunately there are obstacles that can make it difficult for physics departments to implement these learning strategies. Furthermore, there is a need for physics programs to better prepare graduates for a diverse range of non-research careers, and to educate more well-prepared high school physics teachers to meet national demand.<br/> <br/>To address these concerns, the American Physical Society (APS) recognizes that there is a unique opportunity to develop meaningful assessments of physics programs required of nearly every department, while fulfilling their desire to improve the education of their students by implementing known best practices. APS leadership has formed and formally charged a nationally recognized task force of leaders in physics program evaluation and revitalization to create a guide for programmatic assessment, review, and improvement, and to undertake the training of departmental reviewers and department chairs in using the guide. The guide will be an operational document designed to be immediately useful to a department chair or faculty member engaging in programmatic assessment, review, or improvement. The workshops funded through this award will allow the APS to lay the groundwork to ensure that APS can achieve national impact.<br/> <br/>An initial workshop for the task force to meet in person will be held May 18-19, 2017 in College Park, MD to plan project phases, and to construct a comprehensive plan for engaging community leaders in adopting and shaping guide practices. Outcomes of this workshop will include specific written plans for each phase of the project, and clearly articulated positions on the underlying framework of the guide and its implementation. In addition, the APS Committee on Minorities will hold a special workshop with leaders from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Atlanta, prior to their fall 2017 in-person meeting to explore potential actions by the APS to address the devastating reduction of African American participation in undergraduate physics. Specific outcomes of this event will include recommendations to the task force, and plans for synergistic efforts by the APS, the Committee on Minorities, and their programs."

The research explores the potential of publicly available paleoclimate records in combination with a proven modeling technique to address fundamental hypotheses about the time scales, stationarity, anthropogenic influence, and coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics of Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV).  The project is guided by three specific science questions and one far-reaching and overarching question.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the research seeks to address: <br/><br/>Question 1) What is the predictability of AMV as evidenced by proxy records? Do proxy records suggest mechanisms of coupled atmosphere-ocean AMV?<br/><br/>Strategy: To diagnose AMV predictability from proxy records, linear inverse models (LIMs) will be derived from marine and terrestrial proxy records. Eigenvalue analyses will be used to show dominant dynamical patterns and time scales, and marine and terrestrial records will be used to identify coupled climate variability. Forecast skill of models derived from proxies, modern observations, and output from the Last Millennium Reanalysis Project will be compared.<br/><br/>Question 2) Is AMV changing through time, and can we attribute changes to anthropogenic forcing? <br/><br/>Strategy: Non-stationarities in AMV, including possible responses to anthropogenic influences, will be explored using statistical tests, wavelet analyses, and eigenvector analyses of LIMs constructed over temporal subsets of the data.<br/><br/>Question 3) How do AMV dynamics in general circulation models and proxy-derived models differ? <br/><br/>Strategy: Dynamics responsible for AMV in proxy-derived LIMs will be compared to mechanisms for AMV in controls runs from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) archives.<br/><br/>The research is guided by the far-reaching and overarching question: <br/><br/>Question: Do paleoclimate proxy data have power to constrain AMV dynamics and predictability? <br/><br/>Strategy: If ""yes,"" then proxy records can be directly useful in making and evaluating modern climate forecasts, and the techniques can be expanded to other regions and time scales. If ""no,"" then the research will help quantify the limits of proxy records to assess predictability of modern climate, and identify new record types and sites to improve dynamical understanding and predictive power.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts involve supporting an early career scientist, helping reduce the uncertainty in North Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and providing materials to local STEM high school teachers and students through projects already in existence at the university."

The conference focuses on the advancement of research in topology and outreach in mathematics, with specific emphasis on set-theoretic topology. Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.<br/><br/>This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems.

By the year 2050, projections indicate that world-wide food production must increase by 70% in order to feed an expected world population of 9 billion people. Temperature stress is a major contributor to crop loss around the world, with pollen infertility being one of the most important underlying causes.  Fertilization during plant reproduction is highly sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, with even a single hot day or cold night carrying the potential to disrupt reproductive success. Understanding this vulnerability is significant because most of the world's food supply is derived from seed crops that depend on pollination. The transformative potential of the proposed research is derived from pioneering the use of pollen as a model system to gain molecular and genetic insights into thermo-tolerance mechanisms in plants.  Additional contributions to broader impacts will occur through co-mentoring graduate students in a collaboration involving two institutions, the University of Nevada (Reno) and Bar-Ilan University, Israel.  Both institutions share a common goal of increasing agricultural productivity in arid land environments.<br/><br/>The long-term goal is to understand how different plant cells cope with abiotic stress, and to use that knowledge to improve crop productivity. The focus here is on how pollen sense and respond to heat stress during a limited period of time in which they must grow, locate ovules, and discharge male gametophytes to fertilize egg cells. The central hypothesis guiding the proposed research is that a protective heat-stress response in pollen involves signaling pathways that utilize calcium and ROS (reactive oxygen species) to trigger unique pollen-specific changes in the transcriptome. Specific Aim 1 employs a pollen transmission assay to genetically test more than 80 candidate genes for their potential to increase or decrease pollen fertility during a heat stress. Aim 2 is to identify heat-stress dependent changes in the transcriptome that are correlated to managing or responding to changes in cellular levels of ROS. This aim will involve using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter to isolate sub-populations of heat-stressed pollen that show either high or low levels of ROS, and thereby enable a transcriptome comparison to be made between two subpopulations of cells showing differences in their response to heat.  Aim 3 is to use a quantitative proteomics strategy to identify heat-stress dependent changes in post-translational modifications, such as changes in phosphorylation of transcription factors. A unifying goal is to identify candidate genes or post-translational modifications that can be manipulated to improve heat-stress tolerance in pollen."

However, the amount of information that can be communicated is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic quantum noise of the states of light used as information carriers. This noise precludes any measurement from perfectly distinguishing different states and generates decoding errors. This project will investigate and experimentally demonstrate non-conventional measurements for coherent states of light, such as laser light, that exploit the properties of coherent states and single-photon detection to maximize the measurement sensitivity and enhance information transfer, and will develop methods to overcome noise, loss, and imperfections of real communication channels. These non-conventional measurements can in principle provide sensitivities beyond what is possible with current conventional technologies, and can be used to increase the rate of information transfer in optical communication. This project lies at the interface of optics, communication, and quantum information, and will provide an ideal environment for education of undergraduate and graduate students. The educational plan of the project will develop new experiments for laboratory courses at the University of New Mexico (UNM) that will strengthen the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. These new experiments will benefit undergraduate and graduate students in physics and optics including underrepresented minority students. Lab guides will be available online for use by students and instructors within and outside UNM.<br/><br/>Quantum measurements for the discrimination of non-orthogonal coherent phase states can achieve sensitivities beyond the quantum noise limit (QNL), which corresponds to the ultimate limit for ideal coherent (Gaussian) measurements, and can be used to approach the ultimate quantum limits of information transfer. The goal of this project is to investigate and experimentally demonstrate new capabilities of measurements based on non-Gaussian operations for the discrimination of non-orthogonal coherent states for applications in quantum and classical communications. These measurements utilize photon counting, displacement operations and optimized adaptive measurements to enhance sensitivities for the discrimination of multiple states at arbitrary input power levels while being robust under realistic noise and loss of communication channels. These optimized methods can be applied to enhance the rate of information transfer in communications, and experiments will aim to demonstrate measurements with capacities beyond what is achievable with Gaussian measurements using coherent states. This work will make optimized measurements achieving sensitivities beyond the QNL a more realistic alternative to enhance information transfer beyond what can be achieved with conventional communication technologies."

For example, on time scales of hundreds of years, coarse scale proxies indicate that the temperature of the North Atlantic region of the globe may change while the temperature of the South Atlantic region changes with the opposite sign.  Models of this ""bipolar seesaw"" invoke the long-distance transmission (teleconnection) of information through the atmosphere or the ocean.  The proposed work will use ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica to investigate the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections in coupling both hemispheres during so-called ""Heinrich events"" - massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic that happed repeatedly during the last ice age. The work will help climate scientists understand dynamical changes that occur on times scales that are much longer than observational records from weather stations.  The project will also contribute to development of the STEM workforce.  It will provide support for an early-career scientist during the formative years of his career.  It will provide support for one or more undergraduate laboratory technicians and entrain undergraduates, supported through other sources, into the research.  It will include STEM outreach to local middle school students and a teacher training program.  It will result in a series of Wikipedia entries concerning paleoclimate.  As an ancillary benefit, it will improve the chronology of the Greenland ice core to be studied.  This will allow greater synchronization of paleoclimate records between the two poles and facilitate progress in the study of past climates.<br/><br/>The proposed work will generate high-resolution, high-precision records of Greenland (GISP2) ice core methane, 15N/14N ratio of molecular nitrogen, and air content for the period of 14-51 ka before present, to investigate a number of important paleoclimatic questions with a special focus on Heinrich stadials. The proposed work is organized under four overarching goals: (1) to detect the impact of Heinrich events on Greenland climate, and use the timing of these events relative to observed rapid Antarctic warming to investigate whether the mode of interhemispheric climate coupling during these events is via an atmospheric or an oceanic teleconnection; (2) to achieve interpolar methane synchronization of the GISP2 and WAIS Divide ice cores at unprecedented centennial-scale resolution, with applications in studying interhemispheric climate teleconnections and ice core dating.; (3) to provide the most accurate Greenland temperature reconstruction to date by combining nitrogen isotope data with independent delta-age estimates derived from the methane synchronization; and (4) to improve understanding of air content as a proxy for ice sheet elevation, and investigate origin of millennial-scale air content variations during Dansgaard-Oeschger events not previously described in the literature.

The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings. The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit. This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture; (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient: Handheld with no required equipment or training. <br/><br/>The key innovation of the company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas for optimization."

Some of the most interesting diversity involves ecomorphs, which are different species that have evolved to have similar body forms and behaviors that adapt them to the same ecological niche. It is known that the same ecomorph often evolves independently many times, but little is known about what explains overall patterns of ecomorph evolution. For example, is evolutionary change between some ecomorphs more common than others, and what explains these differences? In this project, a new, integrative approach will be developed to explore these fundamental questions about evolution, using frogs as a model system. The approach combines reconstructing species ancestry, (i.e., their evolutionary relationships), with data on species ecology, body morphology, physiological performance (how well they jump, swim, and climb), and their geographic distribution. This study will provide the first exploration of how these different factors explain large-scale patterns of ecomorph evolution across this major group of organisms. To address these factors, the investigators will develop statistical tools that can be applied to any group of organisms. General questions about the methods used to reconstruct evolutionary trees with genetic data will also be addressed. This project will support training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in a diversity of disciplines and techniques. The training will also include a summer undergraduate research experience, with students recruited from historically underrepresented groups. Outreach talks and a video on the project's goals, results, and implications will be delivered to public audiences. <br/><br/>This project has two major objectives. First, a new large-scale phylogeny of anurans will be developed, using new phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements and existing supermatrices. Urgent and general questions about the methodology of phylogenomic analyses will also be addressed. Second, the investigators will estimate patterns of transitions in ecomorphs and test the factors that explain these patterns. Specifically, researchers will collect morphological data from museum specimens for ~2,500 species.  They will also collect new performance data for 65 targeted species from North America, Europe, Africa, and Madagascar, and add this to their existing performance data for 63 species from Asia, Australia, and North and South America.  Data will be obtained on microhabitats and analyzed in the context of the new phylogeny to estimate transition rates among microhabitat-associated ecomorphs. Several hypotheses will then be tested about why transition rates differ among ecomorphs, including hypotheses related to ecomorph morphology, functional performance, diversification rates, and biogeography. Data will come from the scientific literature, specimens from scientific collections, and fieldwork in North America, Europe, and Africa."

To take advantage of our entire talent pool, this project bridges disciplinary findings in social psychology, education, and the scholarship of teaching and learning to understand student experiences of diversity in the STEM classroom. The research investigates the influence of environmental cues in the STEM classroom on the persistence and performance of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM. There are two main, contrasting diversity philosophies. One, colorblindness, emphasizes similarities between racial groups and promotes assimilation into the predominate culture. The other, multiculturalism, emphasizes differences between racial groups and values unique aspects of racial groups. Both philosophies are purportedly pro-diversity, yet they differentially affect women and students of color. This project innovatively investigates the impact of the use of these two philosophies by instructors in STEM classrooms. The project investigates the effect of these philosophies on feelings of inclusion, motivation to persist in study, and actual classroom performance across science and math classes. The findings of this research will provide evidence-based practices to replace well-intentioned but problematic practices to enhance diversity in STEM. These findings could help to increase the STEM talent pool in the U.S. by increasing the number of people who are included in and persist in the STEM academy.<br/><br/>This project tests a model of classroom diversity philosophies that emphasize either colorblind or multiculturalism by STEM instructors, which differently influence the persistence and performance of women and underrepresented minorities in these courses.

The experiments investigate the moderating effects of instructor race and gender on student outcomes, as well as the extent to which diversity content is integrated into the course. This project also examines mechanisms that lead to student outcomes including their perceptions of instructor attitudes and behaviors and the overall classroom climate. The experiments will employ simulated online learning environments to test the impact of diversity philosophies, controlling for individual differences in instructor characteristics. The findings of this research can inform the development of evidence-based best practices to increase persistence and performance of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines, which will expand the U.S. talent pool."

The workshop will be held at the Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, July 9-14, 2017. As our existing infrastructure continues to age, it is of utmost importance to reliably assess and predict the performance of the remaining service life of existing assets. Computational modeling based on fundamental physics theories can be a powerful tool in achieving these goals while it can also be applicable to new constructions to optimize the materials selection and formulation for a desirable design life. Currently, courses related to material deterioration analysis and service life prediction modeling in the graduate civil engineering curriculum are scarce or limited to few institutions. This workshop offers a teaching model that can overcome this challenge. The course will be taught by a group of faculty members (national and international) with relevant research expertise. The outcomes of this course will enable civil engineering graduate students to gain fundamental knowledge related to service-life prediction and to integrate course materials into their current research. <br/><br/>The objective of this workshop is to enhance graduate student learning and research efforts by infusing the basic science and theory to model and predict concrete performance. Students will be introduced to reactive-transport modeling of multi-species and multi-mechanistic transport in concrete; coupled modeling of corrosion propagation of embedded reinforcement and recent developments in coupling reactive processes, which are quantified using thermodynamic modeling, with numerical solutions of extended Nernst-Plank equation for multi-species transport. Basic thermodynamic modeling principles, Gibbs Free Energy Minimization processes and introduce open-source algorithms (e.g. GEMS framework) and thermodynamic databases (e.g. CEMDATA) that use this approach will also be explored. In addition, students will have hands on experience with different analytical equipment to evaluate laboratory and field aged cement and concrete samples. The instructors will incorporate the verification of prediction models using analytical results from those test data. Effective technical communication including proposal writing skills will also be introduced to the graduate students."

For nearly a century, studies have shown that muscles use energy differently during shortening versus lengthening. The studies supported by this research funding will test how whole-muscle characteristics of shortening and lengthening are linked to changes in the molecular activity of the motor protein, myosin. Fundamentally, myosin is the molecular motor that turn chemical energy into force and shortening in a muscle, thereby powering locomotion and blood flow. The goal of this proposal is to measure, model, and predict how myosin activity changes with muscle length during a contraction. There are three main types of striated muscle: slow skeletal muscle, fast skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle. These muscle types have distinctly different functions, and a better mechanistic understanding of the molecular phenomena underlying force production and power output during muscle shortening and lengthening will ultimately help determine critical mechanisms of coupling from the molecule to the tissue and organism levels that enable movement. A portion of these research efforts will continue to train a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students in biophysical and computational biology research. Outreach and educational efforts, in collaboration with the Native American Programs Office and Office of Undergraduate Research, will inform students at local schools and regional Tribal Colleges about the wide-ranging potential to integrate their scientific interests with fulfilling employment opportunities.<br/><br/>In the proposed research, biophysical system analysis will be used to measure how dynamic changes in muscle length influence myosin kinetics and force generation. Measurements of myosin rate-transitions in intact, electrically stimulated skeletal and cardiac muscles will be extended to probe isometric contraction, as well as dynamic contractions during lengthening and shortening. Complementary skinned fiber measurements will enable measurements of cross-bridge nucleotide handling rates as muscle fibers shorten and lengthen. These empirical findings will be integrated with computational models of muscle contraction to better interpret and predict the impact of myosin force production and energy utilization from the molecule to the sarcomere, fiber, and muscle. This principled, quantitative approach will provide an initial step towards defining similarities and differences between striated muscle type, myosin isoform, and muscle structure that ultimately influence functional diversity of striated muscle systems."

Some animals evolve to advertise to potential predators that they are poisonous (warning coloration). Different toxic species may converge on the same color pattern, giving both an advantage by more effectively advertising to predators. This is known as Müllerian mimicry, a focus of interest because it involves multiple phenomena that lie at the heart of our understanding of evolutionary processes. The genetic basis of mimicry is of special interest, because it provides a window into how these key evolutionary processes unfold. This research will focus on discovering the genetic underpinnings of Müllerian mimicry in a species of poison frog that has undergone an evolutionary radiation across different geographic regions of Peru. In each region, the mimic poison frog has evolved a different color pattern (such as stripes, bands, or spots), to resemble another species in that region. The evolution of these new color patterns may be driving reproductive isolation between populations of the mimic poison frog, leading to speciation and the creation of new biodiversity. The project is a collaborative endeavor between researchers at three large public universities and will involve broad participation by undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. The results of the project will be used to enhance K12 education through classroom presentations, public lectures and museum displays.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on four specific aims: 1. Identify key genetic factors involved in color pattern development in the mimic poison frog by investigating differential gene expression across developmental stages and color pattern morphs, using next generation sequencing to produce stage-specific transcriptomes for each morph, which will be assembled to analyze patterns of differential gene expression. 2. Identify the causal gene(s) underlying differences in color pattern between morphs using genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture sequences) to screen transition zone samples (from three transition zones) and enable admixture mapping to discover candidate genes. 3. Test the association of specific candidate loci with color pattern using multigenerational pedigrees. 4. Test specific hypotheses regarding selection and demographic processes in the transition zones and between mimics and models, using new analytical tools. Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing approaches will elucidate the genetic underpinnings and population genomics of color pattern evolution and diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison frogs."

As a result, induced seismicity has become a focal point of earthquake science in the United States over the last few years; however, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of induced seismicity.  In this research the well-recorded 2011 Prague, OK earthquake sequence will be used to investigate deformation on a scale not commonly obtainable in seismicity studies (earthquake location with precision ~10 meters). Such well-located earthquakes allow for better understanding of how complex faults fail.  Furthermore, laboratory experiments on the rocks from the Prague area will provide information on how strong and stable the faults are, and how pumping fluids into the faults might promote earthquakes.<br/><br/>The Prague sequence contains three earthquakes greater than Mw5 and their robust aftershock sequences, as well as the foreshock sequences for two large events. The precision with which the Prague earthquakes can be located allows the failure processes to be considered on a scale comparable to fault structures measured in studies of exhumed faults. In addition, complementary laboratory experiments on lithologies from the Prague area will allow study of the effects of fluid pressure on fault strength and stability. The ultimate goal is to use the Prague dataset to probe the influence of fluid pressure and fault zone complexity on earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest. Specifically this work will address the following questions: 1) Do the faults near Prague show precursory activity that could be used to forecast rupture? 2) How does complex fault geometry control rupture? and 3) How do fault strength, strength heterogeneity, and fault stability play a role in induced earthquakes?"

Some examples include Zika virus, hepatitis C virus, foot and mouth disease virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. Despite infecting very different hosts and causing distinct symptoms, viruses in this class use similar strategies to replicate their genomic RNAs. As an indispensable process, viral replication also represents an excellent target for the development of antiviral strategies that should provide strong protection and apply to a wide range of important viral pathogens. This project aims to characterize the contributions of viral replication proteins and certain host proteins to viral replication and is expected to provide new insights on mechanisms required for viral replication as well as novel approaches for virus control. The project is also expected to provide undergraduate students from underrepresented groups with valuable experience in translational plant science and inspire them to seek more research opportunities and attend graduate schools in the field of plant science.    <br/>	<br/>A highly conserved feature of positive-strand RNA virus replication is that these viruses remodel host intracellular membranes to form their viral replication complexes (VRCs), an essential step in viral replication. Despite its critical importance, the mechanisms by which membranes are remodeled, the lipid microenvironment within VRCs, and the host proteins required for such processes are poorly understood. This project aims to address aforementioned knowledge gaps by using brome mosaic virus (BMV), a model virus used to study the common features shared by positive-strand RNA viruses. BMV invaginates the outer nuclear membrane to form spherular VRCs. The investigators had previously demonstrated that a group of viruses promote host phosphatidylcholine synthesis at the viral replication sites for supporting viral replication. In particular, BMV replication protein 1a interacts with and recruits an enzyme of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis to the VRCs. The recruitment of the enzyme will be blocked by disrupting the specific protein-protein interactions to achieve virus resistance without affecting host lipid synthesis. Because the lipid composition of host intracellular membranes is dynamic and complicated, an in vitro assay has been developed to examine how BMV replication protein 1a and similar viral replication proteins generate membrane invaginations of liposomes with defined lipid compositions. In addition, host protein Erv14 has been found to be required for BMV replication. The mechanism whereby Erv14 is involved in BMV VRC assembly and the possible involvement of Erv14 in the replication of other plant viruses will be determined. <br/>"

The proposal hypothesizes that wind blown chloride-containing dust from dried saline lake beds (playas) can be converted to nitryl-chloride (ClNO2) by heterogeneous reactions with gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5). The ClNO2 photolysis produces Cl atoms that could alter the ozone production photochemistry and the methane lifetime significantly. The research will measure the kinetics of ClNO2 production from reactions of salt with N2O5 in a trace gas-aerosol flow reactor. Chemical ionization mass spectrometry will be used to monitor ClNO2 in the reactor and the playa dusts will be analyzed using single-particle mass spectrometry, ion chromatography and X ray diffraction.  The in depth analysis of the chemical and atmospheric conditions under which chlorine can be released from the saline playas will provide a mechanistic framework that could be implemented in chemistry-climate and air-quality models to make more robust predictions and assessments."

Glial cells were traditionally thought to passively support neurons. The present research tries to answer foundational questions about how glial cells are involved in brain development, such as what the differences are among the types of glial cells that exist in developing brains, how glial cells support the actively-dividing cell populations that build the brain (neural stem cells), the role that glial cells play in the development of the blood-brain-barrier, and how glial cells affect the intricate pattern of connections that form in the developing brain. Zebrafish are used for this research because of the ease with which these questions can be studied in a vertebrate animal that is optically clear. This work combines the advantages of zebrafish genetics and embryology together with high resolution 5D microscopy (3 spatial dimensions followed over time for several different cell-marking colors) to precisely measure glial cell development, and to assess the role that an important molecule involved in cell-cell communication called Roundabout4 plays in these processes. In addition to greatly furthering scientific understanding of glial cell biology and development, this award will support the recruitment of a diverse set of student scientists through the establishment of a peer mentor training program, and the continuation of a primary and secondary education outreach program using zebrafish called Student Scientists.<br/><br/>This project explores the hypotheses that heterogeneous astroglia exist in the zebrafish embryonic forebrain to guide cell types at the midline that build neurons, commissures, blood vessels, and cartilage, and that Slit-Robo4 signaling underlies this astroglial mechanism of cell guidance. These hypotheses will be tested in three specific ways. First, the developmental ontogeny of forebrain astroglia will be characterized in detail. New transgenic reporters will be used to track every astroglial cell in the diencephalon with time lapse Lightsheet microcopy, and live cell behaviors will be used to chart the developmental derivation of forebrain astroglia during neurogenesis, commissure and blood vessel formation. Next, experiments will be carried out to see if Robo4 is required cell-autonomously for astroglial guidance during neural stem cell niche, postoptic commissure, and blood-brain barrier formation. A newly-created robo4 knockout will be used to determine exactly which cell populations require Robo4 function for progenitor cell generation in the stem cell niche, for the midline crossing of axons, and for astroglial-endothelial cell interactions during blood-brain-barrier development. Finally, Robo4 functions downstream of Slit signaling will be examined during commissure formation.  Because Roundabout receptors mediate Slit signaling, functional interactions between Robo4 and Slit1a/2 will be investigated to see if they are responsible for Robo4-dependent astroglial behaviors."

M.<br/>North Carolina State University<br/>EAGER: Tandem Solar Cells of Two Dissimilar Material Systems<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Tandem solar cells are an approach capable of achieving a conversion efficiency higher than 45%. This approach involves stacking several cells with different properties for the optimum utilization of the solar spectrum. Currently all satellite and space communication systems are powered by tandem solar cell structures. However these structures suffer from several limitations such as cost and material related issues. They thus cannot compete for terrestrial applications which are currently dominated by silicon and inexpensive cell technology with efficiencies less than 20%. The goal of this EAGER project is to develop the science and technology to allow the high efficiency tandem cell concept to be applied to cells made from inexpensive material systems. We propose a new approach that relies on intermetallic bonding (IMB) to assemble two or more cells that may be composed of dissimilar material systems into a tandem cell structure.  This IMB approach can impact several different fields such as LEDs emitting at different wavelengths and dual wavelength photodetectors. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will gain experience in device fabrication, testing and modeling. Students will be part of research activities that can impact the national goals of renewable energy.<br/><br/>The IMB approach relies on the adhesion properties of indium (In) metal. Indium films will be deposited on the existing grid contacts of various solar cells. Bonding between the cells will take place by applying pressure at room temperature, resulting in In-metal bonding between the two cells.   The research program will focus on the development of the IMB technique, aligning the bottom contact of the top cell and top contact of the bottom cells, finding the optimum conditions for both mechanical strength and a low resistance connecting junction with minimum shadowing losses. We will investigate MJ structures from off-the-shelf bottom cells [Si (1.1 eV) or CIGS (1.0 eV)] and epitaxially grown junctions from the PI's lab for the top cell based on InGaP/multiple quantum well structures or AlGaAs to tune the band gap between 1.55 and 1.7 eV.  The above combinations can approach efficiencies close to 30%, in a two terminal device structure. We have successfully applied the IMB technique to bond GaAs/InGaP and Si/GaAs showing both mechanical stability and electrical conductivity. We have shown that the IMB offers a very low resistivity interconnects and was successfully applied to demonstrate the proof of concept in the case of GaAs/Si tandem cell."

As a result, induced seismicity has become a focal point of earthquake science in the United States over the last few years; however, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of induced seismicity.  In this research the well-recorded 2011 Prague, OK earthquake sequence will be used to investigate deformation on a scale not commonly obtainable in seismicity studies (earthquake location with precision ~10 meters). Such well-located earthquakes allow for better understanding of how complex faults fail.  Furthermore, laboratory experiments on the rocks from the Prague area will provide information on how strong and stable the faults are, and how pumping fluids into the faults might promote earthquakes.<br/><br/>The Prague sequence contains three earthquakes ¡Ý Mw5 and their robust aftershock sequences, as well as the foreshock sequences for two large events. The precision with which the Prague earthquakes can be located allows the failure processes to be considered on a scale comparable to fault structures measured in studies of exhumed faults. In addition, complementary laboratory experiments on lithologies from the Prague area will allow study of the effects of fluid pressure on fault strength and stability. The ultimate goal is to use the Prague dataset to probe the influence of fluid pressure and fault zone complexity on earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest. Specifically this work will address the following questions: 1) Do the faults near Prague show precursory activity that could be used to forecast rupture? 2) How does complex fault geometry control rupture? and 3) How do fault strength, strength heterogeneity, and fault stability play a role in induced earthquakes?"

The model is proven to perpetuate itself, where invested collaborations ultimately mature to independent funding. The broader impacts of this work include meaningful research experiences to attract and retain the nation's diverse student talent pool. This will have the consequence of enhancing and diversifying the U.S. workforce by adding experts in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. <br/><br/>This project focuses on strong financial and infrastructure support of research collaborations that invigorate faculty from PUIs, HBCs, and LSAMP institutions. These faculty in turn directly impact students and learning environments at their home institutions. REU students have novel chemical research experiences in exciting and broad scientific themes, such as nanotechnology, homeland security, pharmaceutical drug design, forensic sciences, and chemical biology. Each student works directly with two faculty mentors in the laboratory (from the home institution and Duquesne). Students also consult with a theoretical faculty liaison, since each REU project is supplemented by well-defined computational components to expand the students' experience. REU students receive explicit training to reinforce the scientific method, scientific writing and speaking, ethics, safety, and workshops on state-of-the-art instrumentation to complement their experimental research and build invaluable skill sets.

The current situation surrounding the uncertainty in the knowledge of G is puzzling the fundamental physics and precision measurement communities. The world's best experiments yield values which are incompatible with one another and differ by about 40 times the uncertainty of the most precise experiment. Furthermore, knowing the true value of G is important in various fields, as it is necessary in efforts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics in a quantum theory of gravity. The project enabled by this collaboration will be to carry out carefully controlled metrological experiments where the precision of the measurements will be in the part-per-million. Since part of the past discrepancies between determinations of G can be traced back to the methodology used, the group will combine different approaches to determine G within the same apparatus, hoping to obtain highly precise values of G from each approach, but with the expectation that the values obtained using different methodologies will mimic the current situation in the community, namely, that different methodologies, no matter how precise, yield different results. With the experiments carried out in the same apparatus our effort would then help understand the current discrepancies among existing experimental results.<br/><br/>The project will establish a torsion pendulum facility dedicated to measuring the Newtonian gravitational constant G with unprecedented sensitivity using three different experimental techniques within the same apparatus. An agreed upon value for G remains elusive as recent measurements by different experimental groups have scattered widely, or have had low precision. The spread in measured values and the relatively low precision of the measurements is recognized by the precision measurement community as something that needs to be addressed. This project will build a system based upon the ideas introduced in previous torsion pendulum experiments, but will expand the scope and breadth of the measurements by the multi-mode nature of the apparatus. In the primary mode G will be determined by measuring the angular acceleration needed to keep a torsion pendulum's fiber from twisting while it rotates on a turntable in the presence of carefully designed attractor masses (that also rotate on a separate turntable). This angular acceleration feedback mode has yielded the most precise measurement of G to date, yet it has only been performed once. Compared to previous efforts, the proposed system will achieve smaller metrology errors by using advanced measurement and characterization techniques. Using the same apparatus, G will be determined by measuring the change in the resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum with the attractor masses present and removed by measuring the thermally induced oscillation of the pendulum. In the third approach, G will be determined by large amplitude determination of the change in the resonant frequency of the pendulum when the attractor masses are at two different positions. Each technique is expected to provide a measurement with a relative error of approximately 2 ppm. The measurements performed within this project will be of broad interest to scientists in diverse fields of physics and metrology, and the approach may shed light on why previous experiments have resulted in discrepant measurements of G. In addition to broad scientific interest, undergraduate and graduate students will be integral to the success of the project. They will be trained in experimental physics and precision measurement techniques. The project will provide training and education for first-generation college students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds by recruiting from a rural, federally-recognized Hispanic Serving Institution that has limited research opportunities on campus. Students from three different universities will be in contact, enhancing their exposure to different academic cultures and providing networking opportunities. As part of the proposed activities, demonstrations associated with the principles of forces will be developed and used at community gathering events, recruiting events and in classroom environments."

This project uses mice to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms to represent and interpret vocal communication. Mice have simpler vocalizations, are more amenable to scientific inquiry, and have brain organization homologous to humans. Sensory processing of sounds begins at the ear where a representation of different sound frequencies arises and gets relayed to an area of the brain called the auditory cortex. This area is involved in some of the earliest complex operations needed to recognition vocal sound patterns, but the neural mechanisms remain mysterious. It is believed that one important strategy the brain utilizes to process vocalizations is to assign distinct computational tasks to the left and right auditory cortices, a division of labor called lateralization. Conceptually, this project will exploit this functional lateralization to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying vocalization processing. The instructions to brain functions and ultimately behavior are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying lateralized circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to sound processing functions is the foundation of this proposal. Using cutting-edge techniques for high-throughput circuit mapping, functional imaging, and optogenetics, this project will compare the development, connectivity and operations of the left and right auditory cortices. The results and framework of this proposal will be powerful tools to establish how the auditory cortex encodes the communicative significance of sounds. A unique aspect of the educational component of the project is to train students to develop of animations of various topics in Neuroscience to be distributed on various educational sites.<br/><br/>Vocalizations offer unique advantages for survival and social interactions by allowing animals to communicate rapidly over a range of distances, and encode an individual's identity. Accordingly, an animal's brain must perform the challenging tasks of recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. From humans to mice the auditory cortex performs many of these tasks, but the neural mechanisms are unknown. One strategy believed to be important in processing vocalizations is the division of computational tasks between the left and right auditory cortices (i.e. lateralization). The investigators will exploit lateralization to reveal functional differences between the auditory cortices that may underlie specializations responsible for extracting the valence and meaning of vocalizations. The firing pattern of individual neurons in response to sensory input defines its neural code and is determined by a neuron's precise pattern of synaptic connections. Hence, it is necessary to obtain the connectivity profile of cell types to link coding strategies with functional significance. Using the molecular toolbox available in the mouse the investigators will identify neuronal populations with lateralized activation using the activity marker c-fos, use circuit-mapping techniques in vitro to screen for lateralized circuit-motifs, and determine the contribution of sensory experience in the development of lateralized auditory processing. Circuit-level insights will guide experiments in vivo to establish their functional significance using a combination of electrophysiology and optogenetics. The results will reveal specializations underlying lateralized functions, and provide a short-list of testable neural mechanisms responsible for vocalization processing.  In addition to training graduate students and undergraduates, the PI will work with the Biology Animation Assistantship program at CCNY to create and make available animations on topics ranging from synaptic transmission to audition. A Student Assessment of Learning Gains survey will be given to assess the benefit of the assistantship."

Axons allow nerve cells to communicate electrically with each other and with other cells throughout the body. Each axon contains a microscopic, internal scaffold of space-filling proteins called neurofilaments that are constantly shuttled along the axon by molecular motor proteins; these define axon shape and size. Neurofilaments accumulate during development, increasing axon diameter and allowing electrical activity to travel more quickly; excessive accumulation (as occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases) can lead to communication abnormalities and axonal degeneration. This project tests the hypothesis that the rate of neurofilament transport determines the diameter, shape and function of axons.  The work will be conducted by a seasoned interdisciplinary team of biologists and physicists, combining innovative biological imaging techniques with mathematical and computational methods to investigate these important questions. The insights gained from this research will be critical for understanding healthy brain function and could also provide important insights into the axonal problems observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Trainees on this project from both the physical and life sciences will work in teams supervised by the principal investigators, and will expand their skills through interdisciplinary interaction, adding to the skilled research workforce at the interface of the physical and life sciences. To extend the impact of the proposed research to the K-12 level, the physicists and biologists on this project will host focused, small-group workshops that will seek to empower middle and high school teachers with ideas and tools to invigorate their instruction in the areas of cell biology and algorithmic thinking, and introducing freely available but powerful learning tools that they can apply in their classrooms.<br/><br/>The function of nervous systems is dependent on the propagation of action potentials along axons at a velocity that is specific to their physiological function. This velocity is dependent on axon size and shape. A principal determinant of axon size and shape in vertebrates are space-filling cytoskeletal polymers called neurofilaments. Neurofilaments are also cargoes of axonal transport that move along microtubule tracks. Thus, neurofilaments define axonal morphology, but they are also in constant flux. The proposed research addresses this intriguing and physiologically important relationship. The central hypothesis is that the kinetics of neurofilament transport determines axonal neurofilament content, which in turn specifies axonal caliber and function. The specific goals are to determine the dynamic interplay between neurofilament transport velocity and flux in the specification of overall axon caliber, and how neurofilaments navigate local constrictions at the nodes of Ranvier. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will employ a tight integration of computational and mathematical methods with innovative live imaging of myelinated axons in peripheral nerves ex vivo from a new transgenic mouse that expresses a photoactivatable neurofilament protein in neurons."

These jolts often raise concerns about peoples' access to and ability to use these new technologies, and about the stress they put on the infrastructure that supports them.  This proposal studies the impacts of a rare ""natural experiment"" caused by the recent policy decision in India to remove certain currency from circulation, which is leading to a sudden and massive push toward the use of digital tools for managing money.  The research team plans to work with students, businesspeople, and people with visual impairments in India to address two main questions: (1) how financial technologies such as phone-based payments are adopted and adapted to respond to new legal requirements; and (2) how the usability, availability, and necessity of using a given technology interact to shape its success.  Better understanding of how the social and technical elements of the financial system adapt to this jolt will advance our understanding of technology infrastructures in general and inform the design of accessible technologies and technologies for contexts where financial, educational, and technology experience resources are limited. Studying this in India will provide important insights for U.S. companies looking to enter the Indian market or already operating there, and will also offer key insights on prospects and challenges in broadening the cashless economy in the U.S. The project will also provide educational experiences that cross both intellectual and national borders that will help train a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Based on an integration of ICTD and infrastructure studies, this project will develop better understanding of how people adapt to technology in forced or deterministic contexts. The team will study and compare three different user populations: 1) college students; 2) people working in the informal sector; and 3) people with visual impairments.  These populations were chosen to highlight different aspects of the broader population: college students are less reliant on the cash economy and more educated; those in the informal sector are more cash-reliant and less educated; and those with visual impairments may gain transactional benefits from not having to handle cash, but also have to overcome inaccessibility of mainstream technology. The research will employ a two-stage plan that starts with interviews to capture nuance and inform questions that can be asked in a second, survey stage; the team plans to conduct the research twice, once in the first 6 months and again (with improvements based on the first round) in the last 3 months of the year-long project, to capture both relatively fresh and longitudinal experiences of the jolt.  Leveraging existing relationships with payment providers, visually impaired groups, and informal workers, the researchers will study the ecosystem of payment technologies people use, the ways their specific design affects people's ability to use them, and how their social network both supports (through intermediation) and affects (through network effects) the ways they can use those technologies. This will provide lessons for understanding and improving innovation and technology use in marginalized communities, lessons that may transfer to other contexts such as the rapid adoption of mobile health apps and the use of technology in natural disaster situations."

In this approach, five-coordinate square pyramidal complexes with a terminal multiple bond to a heteroatom in the apical position are utilized so that the electronic consequences of this geometric arrangement can be used to develop catalysts for the activation of small molecules. Dr. Ison is developing a new type of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, where a transition metal oxo acts as the Lewis base component. These new FLPs are effective as catalysts for hydrogenation, and involve a new mechanism for substrate activation by a transition metal complex where the metal does not directly participate, but instead plays an ancillary role. Fundamental mechanistic studies as well as high-level density functional theory(DFT) calculations are being used to understand the structure and reactivity of these FLPs and to design new catalytic systems In this project, Dr. Ison is developing FLP catalyst for asymmetric hydrogenations and the activation of carbon dioxide.

Scholars, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) develop and implement strategies designed to create positive interactions between members of conflicting groups as means to prevent violence. These strategies, however, are not tested among groups currently engaged in conflict, which prevents insight into possible effects of particular strategies -- whether they serve to prevent violence or escalate conflict.  This project initiates economic collaboration between two conflicting groups to study how intergroup contact might reduce intergroup prejudice. To do so, this study utilizes a behavioral game as means to gain a measure of intergroup prejudice. The researcher devises a new way to measure prejudice through the observation altruistic or selfish behavior during structured intergroup interactions, instead of the more prevalent survey-based procedure. The project is implemented with the assistance of a peace-building NGO in an area marked by significant intergroup violence between farmers and animal herders, which results in thousands of deaths per year, high levels of food insecurity, significant property destruction, and the displacement of families and communities. Results from the study will provide valuable insight to inform scholars and policymakers about effective strategies to prevent violence between groups. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This research focuses on strategies to reduce violence between conflicting groups.  In particular, it works with a peace-building NGO program that developed such a strategy derived from a ""contact hypothesis.""  This approach posits that structured interactions between members of competing groups is the most effective means of reducing intergroup prejudice. Numerous studies confirm that intergroup interactions can reduce prejudice.  Experiences with outgroups has been shown to remove negative stereotypes and allow the prejudicial individual to re-conceptualize the outgroup. Recent studies, however, also conclude that social contact between groups involved in conflict does not always reduce prejudice, and may even increase it. Positive interactions do not always generalize to the entire outgroup, and can increase prejudice when such positive interaction conflicts with an individual's strongly held prejudicial beliefs. This project contributes to the research intergroup contact and prejudice reduction by testing if and how sustained economic collaboration might reduce prejudice between conflicting groups. An additional and equally important contribution of this project is a novel and new procedure to measure of prejudice in the field. Prejudice is typically measured via survey responses, which raises questions with respect to the reliability of the measure. Instead of a survey-based measure, this study evaluates prejudice directly by observing behavior in a public goods game played between farmers and animal herders, groups engaged in violent conflict. This project offers an empirical test of contact theory to reduce prejudice between conflicting groups and a novel measure of prejudice. Its findings will benefit scholars, policymakers, and NGOs in evaluating the effectiveness of their conflict prevention and prejudice reduction strategies."

Successfully utilizing non-precious metal catalysts improves the sustainability, economics, and environmental impact of many technologies that are crucial to society.  However, accomplishing this requires the development of new non-precious catalysts that function as well as, or better than, established precious metal catalysts. In this project, Dr. Mankad is developing a new strategy for catalyzing reactions of importance to the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The concept uses two non-precious metals to achieve chemical reactions typically conducted with a single precious metal.

The targeted transformations include carbonylative C-C coupling reactions (typically catalyzed by Pd) that allow for the modular synthesis of ketone products from simple starting materials, dehydrogenative C-H borylation reactions (typically catalyzed by Ir) that allow for direct synthesis of arylboronic esters that are valuable synthetic building blocks, and alkyne semi-hydrogenation reactions (typically catalyzed by Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir) that exhibit unusual stereoselectivity dictated by the bimetallic reaction mechanism.

In these models, hibernators periodically rewarm to active levels between bouts of depressed metabolism. In this research, a unique model of hibernation will be used. Common tenrecs (Tenrec ecaudatus) originate from Madagascar and in contrast to all other known hibernators, do not periodically arouse from hibernation.  Moreover, these mammals have a very variable active body temperature, which allows for direct comparison between active and hibernating tenrecs at the same body temperatures. This research will determine the extent and duration of metabolic savings associated with hibernation.  In addition, studies will determine how kidney function, protein synthesis, and protein degradation are affected by body temperature and hibernation status in tenrecs. It is anticipated that this research will not only reveal the underlying mechanisms for this novel form of hibernation, but provide insight into the evolution of hibernation. Students will receive research training throughout the course of this project and outreach efforts will include development of a television program on hibernation. <br/><br/>Tenrecs may be the closest extant representative to the early placental mammal ancestor. Surprisingly little is known of the physiology of tenrecs and even less is known about their unusual mode of hibernation. The common tenrec, Tenrec ecaudatus, normally experiences wide fluctuations in body temperature and we found these animals experience a novel form of hibernation wherein animals are consistently lethargic throughout the Austral winter. Even when handled or held at warm temperatures, tenrecs do not arouse to the extent seen in other small hibernators such as ground squirrels. The investigators will combine respirometry measurements with telemetric measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, and tissue oxygenation, to understand the energetics of metabolic suppression. Since vital homeostatic processes such as renal function and protein metabolism are essentially restricted to the interbout arousal in rodents like ground squirrels, the lack of an interbout arousal in the tenrecs begs the question of the status of these processes. They will determine how tenrec glomerular filtration and renal blood flow are affected by body temperature and hibernation. In addition, the status of transcription, translation, and protein degradation during hibernation in tenrecs will be monitored. These data will serve as an important mechanistic foundation for understanding hibernation in tenrecs and, importantly, will serve as a platform for understanding the function and perhaps evolution of the interbout arousal- a feature common to all other known small mammal hibernators."

They also play a key role in forcing the circulation patterns, and thus are central to our understanding and prediction of weather and climate. Because these processes occur at spatial scales smaller than that of the grid sizes of global weather and climate models, they need to be related to large-scale flow statistically in numerical models, or represented by parameterizations. The success of parameterizations demands physically based and process-level understanding of the moist convective processes. This project focuses on one important aspect of moist convections, namely cold pools. When rain evaporates into unsaturated air, it cools the air and increases its density, causing it to sink to the surface and spread out horizontally as a density current. These density currents are known as cold pools. They can trigger new storms (which is responsible for the gusty winds and cooler air that one experiences preceding a storm), modify near-surface fluxes, atmospheric stability, and affect the characteristics and development of convective clouds.  In this project, high-resolution numerical simulations that explicitly resolve the cold pools and processes that produce them are used along with innovative particle tracking to unravel the many factors that contribute to the birth, evolution, and demise of cold pools, as well as to quantify how cold pools modify the characteristics of moist convections and how to represent these effects statistically in global models of weather and climate.<br/><br/>Clouds and convection remain major sources of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions. By improving process-level understanding and representation of a key feature of convective clouds, this research will help reduce such uncertainties. This research will also strengthen collaboration between university scientists and train postdoctoral scientists, and contribute to the development of weather and climate models."

Many cells have therefore evolved sophisticated rapid-response mechanisms that allow them to adapt to new environments. One such mechanism is post-translational modification of proteins, where the attachment or removal of small molecules to proteins after their initial formation allows for rapid and reversible regulation of protein activity. One type of protein modification, by the small 2-carbon acetyl unit (acetylation) has long been known to play a role in regulating which genes are expressed under different conditions. However, the surprising discovery of thousands of acetylated proteins in diverse organisms suggests a much broader role. The overall goal of this project is to understand how protein acetylation regulates stress defense in yeast. The project will identify which yeast proteins are modified by acetylation during the response to elevated temperatures, the enzymes responsible for those modifications, and how acetylation impacts protein function. In addition to addressing a fundamental knowledge gap, this project will provide broad scientific training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Undergraduates will include summer interns recruited through the George Washington Carver Research Program, which serves underrepresented students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Additionally, the project team will partner with a small local fermentation business to design a new Microbial Fermentation Laboratory course. The course will introduce students to the science behind fermentation, while lab exercises will provide hands-on experience in fermentation microbiology and biotechnology. <br/><br/>The heat shock response is a universal mechanism for dealing with stress, and has been well studied in yeast and other model organisms. The proposed work will reveal novel and previously unexplored roles for protein acetylation in the heat shock response. Specifically, quantitative acetyl-proteomics will be used on yeast cells responding to heat stress over time to identify which proteins change in acetylation state, which sites are differentially acetylated, and the stoichiometry of acetylation. To implicate the enzymes responsible for protein acetylation changes during heat stress, acetyl-proteomics will be performed on acetyltransferase and deacetylase mutants. To gain fundamental insight into how acetylation affects protein function, the focus will be on the acetylation of stress-responsive transcription factors for detailed mechanistic characterization. Transcriptional profiling and network analysis will be used to connect the timing of changes in acetylation of transcription factors during heat stress with the timing of gene expression changes for those transcription factors? targets. Multiple genetic approaches will be used to probe the in vivo effects of transcription factor acetylation on protein function. To corroborate the in vivo findings, fully acetylated and fully unacetylated transcription factors will be purified to test the effects of acetylation in vitro. In addition to providing new insights into regulation of the yeast heat shock response, results from the proposed experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies exploring how acetylation impacts other stress responses, how acetylation changes are regulated under diverse conditions, and whether these regulatory phenomena are conserved in other diverse organisms."

The current situation surrounding the uncertainty in the knowledge of G is puzzling the fundamental physics and precision measurement communities. The world's best experiments yield values which are incompatible with one another and differ by about 40 times the uncertainty of the most precise experiment. Furthermore, knowing the true value of G is important in various fields, as it is necessary in efforts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics in a quantum theory of gravity. The project enabled by this collaboration will be to carry out carefully controlled metrological experiments where the precision of the measurements will be in the part-per-million. Since part of the past discrepancies between determinations of G can be traced back to the methodology used, the group will combine different approaches to determine G within the same apparatus, hoping to obtain highly precise values of G from each approach, but with the expectation that the values obtained using different methodologies will mimic the current situation in the community, namely, that different methodologies, no matter how precise, yield different results. With the experiments carried out in the same apparatus our effort would then help understand the current discrepancies among existing experimental results.<br/><br/>The project will establish a torsion pendulum facility dedicated to measuring the Newtonian gravitational constant G with unprecedented sensitivity using three different experimental techniques within the same apparatus. An agreed upon value for G remains elusive as recent measurements by different experimental groups have scattered widely, or have had low precision. The spread in measured values and the relatively low precision of the measurements is recognized by the precision measurement community as something that needs to be addressed. This project will build a system based upon the ideas introduced in previous torsion pendulum experiments, but will expand the scope and breadth of the measurements by the multi-mode nature of the apparatus. In the primary mode G will be determined by measuring the angular acceleration needed to keep a torsion pendulum's fiber from twisting while it rotates on a turntable in the presence of carefully designed attractor masses (that also rotate on a separate turntable). This angular acceleration feedback mode has yielded the most precise measurement of G to date, yet it has only been performed once. Compared to previous efforts, the proposed system will achieve smaller metrology errors by using advanced measurement and characterization techniques. Using the same apparatus, G will be determined by measuring the change in the resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum with the attractor masses present and removed by measuring the thermally induced oscillation of the pendulum. In the third approach, G will be determined by large amplitude determination of the change in the resonant frequency of the pendulum when the attractor masses are at two different positions. Each technique is expected to provide a measurement with a relative error of approximately 2 ppm. The measurements performed within this project will be of broad interest to scientists in diverse fields of physics and metrology, and the approach may shed light on why previous experiments have resulted in discrepant measurements of G. In addition to broad scientific interest, undergraduate and graduate students will be integral to the success of the project. They will be trained in experimental physics and precision measurement techniques. The project will provide training and education for first-generation college students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds by recruiting from a rural, federally-recognized Hispanic Serving Institution that has limited research opportunities on campus. Students from three different universities will be in contact, enhancing their exposure to different academic cultures and providing networking opportunities. As part of the proposed activities, demonstrations associated with the principles of forces will be developed and used at community gathering events, recruiting events and in classroom environments."

These signals are intriguing not only because they may attract the attention of predators, but also because they come in many forms, with closely-related species differing in important ways. The efficient coding hypothesis (EC) is a new explanation that states that the human visual system is very good at making sense of the world around us, and when something is easy to understand, it is preferred. EC therefore predicts that male courtship signals will evolve to match their surroundings so that they are easily understood by female receivers. This prediction is in stark contrast to other current theories which predict that courtship signals should stand out from their backgrounds so that they are more easily detected. Here the researchers develop statistical and computational methods to test EC, and apply them to a group of colorful fish found in the eastern United States. Their main objectives are to develop the toolkit to apply EC with many animals and to gather the information they need to design manipulative experiments that will test EC directly. Along the way, they will also provide international training opportunities for student researchers and after-school activities for school children in Baltimore. <br/><br/><br/>This project explores the role of efficient coding in the diversification of complex animal signals. Efficient coding is grounded in information theory and describes how sensory systems maximize information from the environment while minimizing redundancies, thus limiting the number of neurons required to encode relevant information. The efficient coding hypothesis (EC) is applied here to animal signal design to ask whether visual systems adapted to distinct habitats can contribute to the diversification of complex mating signals. EC goes beyond the current signal-detection framework of sensory drive, which predicts that animal signals maximize attractiveness by maximizing detectability. EC predicts that attractive signals also should match statistical parameters of the environment that sensory systems have evolved to decode. The main objectives are to establish the validity of EC in non-humans and to adapt methods developed for humans in terrestrial environments into a toolkit for understanding complex visual signal evolution across animals. The focal study system is the North American freshwater fish genus Etheostoma, called darters. Male darters are characterized by a diversity of vivid, complex, species-specific nuptial color patterns. Although closely-related darter species occupy similar habitats, more distantly-related species have distinct habitat preferences. The central hypothesis is that the adaptation of darter visual systems to encode the statistical regularities of species-specific habitats has contributed to the diversification of complex color patterns across the genus. Three predictions of that hypothesis are tested."

The workshop will introduce scholars to key concepts, methods, objects, and sites of study across the two fields of study. Conference participants will identify new sites for intellectual production through cross-fertilization of research perspectives. In addition to offering established scholars a new, rich set of tools, the workshop lays the groundwork for facilitating collaborative research projects between scholars in each field, and for integrating core concepts from each field into the teaching and training of graduate students. The workshop will develop a research agenda to bring new perspectives to the study of crime and violence, health, and energy and environment that will contribute to improving graduate education and policy makers decision making.<br/><br/><br/>SLS and STS are both mature, interdisciplinary fields that examine the production of knowledge, policies, and practices. Each field has a different yet valuable focus on societal institutions that are often presented as generating outcomes (laws, discoveries) while their inner workings remain invisible. Law and society scholars study law and courts as social processes and practices. STS scholars focus on science, medicine and technology, examining new technologies and the emergence of new scientific fields. Although some law and society scholars focus on science and technology, many do not bring the same critical attention to legally-relevant technologies as they do to the making, implementation, or interpretation of law itself. Similarly, although some STS scholars often focus on policy-in-the-making, the field does not tend to follow policies and laws in action. The workshop aims to bring these two fields in dialogue with each other, offering opportunities to learn about each field?s theoretical contributions, methodological approaches, and organizing questions. The workshop will be hosted at Drexel University in Philadelphia. The schedule will include an overview of core concepts in each discipline, and a series of discussions between the two areas of scholarship to identify synergies and common nodes of analysis. It will contribute to identifying gaps and new curriculum in the study of crime and violence, health, and energy and environment."

Denmark at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is conducting research to develop a new paradigm for the catalytic, enantioselective dichlorination of alkenes. Addition to unsaturated compounds is among the oldest and most reliable of stereospecific transformations. However, the problem of controlling the absolute configuration of the products has proved challenging. The growing number of complex natural products bearing halogen atoms at stereogenic centers has underscored this critical deficiency in synthetic methodology. This proposal addresses the selectivity challenges inherent in the design of enantioselective dihalogenation processes, and formulates mechanism-based solutions to alkene dihalogenations, including those that circumvent the classical haliranium (or alkene-dihalogen pi-complex) intermediates. Professor Denmark has devised a new approach that inverts the classical ""anti"" addition to the double bonds by the use of a specially designed catalyst based on selenium. The resulting ""syn addition"" to double bonds enables the rational development of an enantioselective variant. There are several benefits to society: first in providing a highly skilled workforce to aid in the economic health of our chemistry-based industries.  Second, the significance of chemical catalysis cannot be overestimated as it accounts for over 20% of the USA GDP. Given the emphasis on single enantiomer substances in many reaches of the chemical enterprise, new general and selective processes that provide such materials are of great current interest. <br/><br/>The primary objective of this proposal is to construct the mechanistic/physical organic foundation for the development of generally applicable and highly selective alkene dihalogenations reactions using two different modes of catalysis. These two modes constitute the two Specific Aims of this project, namely: (1) redox active main group catalysis and (2) asymmetric phase transfer catalysis. Within each Specific Aim, we are: (1) learning the structure/reactivity correlations and the rules for achieving high catalytic activity (turnover frequencies and turnover numbers) for the target reactions, (2) carrying out detailed mechanistic investigations of the newly invented catalytic reactions, and (3) designing chiral catalysts that impart high stereoselectivity and high chemical conversion for the introduction of new vicinal stereocenters and (4) demonstrating generality in a variety of substrate classes that represent useful and commonly encountered structural motifs. This award supports an excellent training environment for young scientists in the Denmark group."

To support the progress of geobiology as an integrated discipline, this project funds participation by U.S.-based scientists in the inaugural conference of the Geobiology Society, scheduled for June 11-14, 2017, in Banff, Canada, a world-famous geobiological destination in its own right. Recognizing that a single, international, community-building conference was critically needed to bring together this first generation of self-identifying geobiologists, the Geobiology Society designed this conference to promote the exchange of ideas, tools, and expertise with emphasis on contributions from early-career scientists (newly hired assistant professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students). Reducing participation costs for U.S.-based scientists, who will make up ~70% of the estimated 350 total participants, is a key part of the Geobiology Society's plan to ensure accessibility to this initial meeting, which will in turn seed its long-term sustainability. The society's pledge to sustaining these inclusive, community-building efforts for all stages of scientific experience is in itself a broader impact. In addition, each student attendee will prepare a digital poster presentation to be bundled into an online conference proceedings volume that will be made publically available on the Geobiology Society website.<br/><br/>Leading scientists from both geochemistry and geophysics have recognized the need to bring together scientists with different backgrounds to enhance cross-disciplinary communication. Yet a recent NSF-sponsored workshop on Geomicrobiology and Microbial Geochemistry (October 2013) identified barriers to exchange of relevant information (e.g., on methodologies) among different sub-disciplines as one of the main obstacles to advancing the field of geobiology. Although expertise in any given aspect of geobiology requires specialized training, it is the cross-fertilization among these seemingly disparate fields that defines geobiology, and highlights the need for this shared conference. Because a major goal of this conference is to facilitate bridge building across the disparate fields that define geobiology, particularly from the geological and biological ends of the spectrum, morning programs will be devoted to a single series of oral sessions that all participants will attend; there will be no overlapping or conflicting sessions. The first two full days will explore the modern tools of organic and inorganic geochemistry, molecular biology, microbial ecology, sedimentary geology, and paleontology. The third full day will focus on interpretations of the rock record, including key studies of the modern world that enhance our ability to look back. The afternoons are designed for extended student poster sessions. Additionally, there will be informal talks offered during the poster sessions covering a range of topics, including data visualization, new technological advances in instrumentation, and tips for searching and securing a job."

The proposal will measure the fundamental rate constants of real-world playa dust particles with nitrogen oxides to enable robust assessments of regional air quality impacts in salt playas regions such as Texas.<br/><br/>Reactive chlorine (Cl) atoms when activated can serve as potent atmospheric oxidants that would effect lifetimes of greenhouse gases like methane and also tropospheric ozone abundance. The proposal hypothesizes that wind blown chloride-containing dust from dried saline lake beds (playas) can be converted to nitryl-chloride (ClNO2) by heterogeneous reactions with gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5). The ClNO2 photolysis produces Cl atoms that could alter the ozone production photochemistry and the methane lifetime significantly. The research will measure the kinetics of ClNO2 production from reactions of salt with N2O5 in a trace gas-aerosol flow reactor. Chemical ionization mass spectrometry will be used to monitor ClNO2 in the reactor and the playa dusts will be analyzed using single-particle mass spectrometry, ion chromatography and X ray diffraction.  The in depth analysis of the chemical and atmospheric conditions under which chlorine can be released from the saline playas will provide a mechanistic framework that could be implemented in chemistry-climate and air-quality models to make more robust predictions and assessments."

Axons allow nerve cells to communicate electrically with each other and with other cells throughout the body. Each axon contains a microscopic, internal scaffold of space-filling proteins called neurofilaments that are constantly shuttled along the axon by molecular motor proteins; these define axon shape and size. Neurofilaments accumulate during development, increasing axon diameter and allowing electrical activity to travel more quickly; excessive accumulation (as occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases) can lead to communication abnormalities and axonal degeneration. This project tests the hypothesis that the rate of neurofilament transport determines the diameter, shape and function of axons.  The work will be conducted by a seasoned interdisciplinary team of biologists and physicists, combining innovative biological imaging techniques with mathematical and computational methods to investigate these important questions. The insights gained from this research will be critical for understanding healthy brain function and could also provide important insights into the axonal problems observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Trainees on this project from both the physical and life sciences will work in teams supervised by the principal investigators, and will expand their skills through interdisciplinary interaction, adding to the skilled research workforce at the interface of the physical and life sciences. To extend the impact of the proposed research to the K-12 level, the physicists and biologists on this project will host focused, small-group workshops that will seek to empower middle and high school teachers with ideas and tools to invigorate their instruction in the areas of cell biology and algorithmic thinking, and introducing freely available but powerful learning tools that they can apply in their classrooms.<br/><br/>The function of nervous systems is dependent on the propagation of action potentials along axons at a velocity that is specific to their physiological function. This velocity is dependent on axon size and shape. A principal determinant of axon size and shape in vertebrates are space-filling cytoskeletal polymers called neurofilaments. Neurofilaments are also cargoes of axonal transport that move along microtubule tracks. Thus, neurofilaments define axonal morphology, but they are also in constant flux. The proposed research addresses this intriguing and physiologically important relationship. The central hypothesis is that the kinetics of neurofilament transport determines axonal neurofilament content, which in turn specifies axonal caliber and function. The specific goals are to determine the dynamic interplay between neurofilament transport velocity and flux in the specification of overall axon caliber, and how neurofilaments navigate local constrictions at the nodes of Ranvier. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will employ a tight integration of computational and mathematical methods with innovative live imaging of myelinated axons in peripheral nerves ex vivo from a new transgenic mouse that expresses a photoactivatable neurofilament protein in neurons."

Some animals evolve to advertise to potential predators that they are poisonous (warning coloration). Different toxic species may converge on the same color pattern, giving both an advantage by more effectively advertising to predators. This is known as Müllerian mimicry, a focus of interest because it involves multiple phenomena that lie at the heart of our understanding of evolutionary processes. The genetic basis of mimicry is of special interest, because it provides a window into how these key evolutionary processes unfold. This research will focus on discovering the genetic underpinnings of Müllerian mimicry in a species of poison frog that has undergone an evolutionary radiation across different geographic regions of Peru. In each region, the mimic poison frog has evolved a different color pattern (such as stripes, bands, or spots), to resemble another species in that region. The evolution of these new color patterns may be driving reproductive isolation between populations of the mimic poison frog, leading to speciation and the creation of new biodiversity. The project is a collaborative endeavor between researchers at three large public universities and will involve broad participation by undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. The results of the project will be used to enhance K12 education through classroom presentations, public lectures and museum displays.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on four specific aims: 1. Identify key genetic factors involved in color pattern development in the mimic poison frog by investigating differential gene expression across developmental stages and color pattern morphs, using next generation sequencing to produce stage-specific transcriptomes for each morph, which will be assembled to analyze patterns of differential gene expression. 2. Identify the causal gene(s) underlying differences in color pattern between morphs using genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture sequences) to screen transition zone samples (from three transition zones) and enable admixture mapping to discover candidate genes. 3. Test the association of specific candidate loci with color pattern using multigenerational pedigrees. 4. Test specific hypotheses regarding selection and demographic processes in the transition zones and between mimics and models, using new analytical tools. Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing approaches will elucidate the genetic underpinnings and population genomics of color pattern evolution and diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison frogs."

Research along directions pursued in the project will complement the already extensive literature in economics and social sciences on equilibria, by offering new perspectives through the lens of algorithms, approximation, and computational complexity.  In addition to curriculum development, mentoring PhD students, and involving undergraduate students in accessible projects, the PIs will actively pursue outreach activities and broadly disseminate results obtained in the project.<br/><br/>Some of the research directions that the PIs plan to explore include the following:  1) Deepen our understanding of the new exponential-time hypothesis for fixed-point computation employed by Rubinstein in his recent breakthrough, by exploring its connections with other natural conjectures on the exact complexity of fundamental equilibrium computation problems.  2) Explore connections between two problems that have been studied intensively in the literature, the problem of finding an approximate Nash equilibrium in an anonymous game with a polynomial precision and that in a two-player game with a constant precision.  3) Study the computation of equilibria in games and markets with a unique equilibrium.  Equilibrium as a prediction tool is more meaningful when a unique equilibrium exists.  4) Work towards a dichotomy theorem for Arrow-Debreu market equilibria that aims to classify every family of utilities into those that are easy to solve and those that are intractable."

To facilitate this transition, it is critical to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers with the abilities to combine experimental and theoretical approaches to biological systems. This conference will create a platform for exchanging ideas and fostering collaborations between experimentalists and theoreticians, and provide a rare opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers to interact with and learn from leading scientists in the field. ICSB 2017 will also maximize the visibility of talented young researchers by selecting the best abstracts for oral presentation in parallel sessions and by highlighting the poster sessions that showcase everyone?s research.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

This high diversity has important implications for sustainable agriculture and for the conservation of biodiversity because genetic diversity allows crops and wild plants and animals to persist in the face of disease and other environmental challenges.  Understanding genetic diversity is also important in medicine because individuals have different susceptibility to disease and they can respond differently to the same treatment; this is the foundation of the recent emphasis on ""personalized medicine"".  However, high genetic diversity is surprising because we expect that local populations that share a common gene pool and experience similar environments should be relatively genetically homogenous. This project addresses the debate about why individuals within populations (including humans) are so genetically diverse.  Specifically, the research team will test a prominent hypothesis: that high diversity is maintained because rare gene variants confer an advantage to individuals who bear them (i.e., they are favored by natural selection).  The project will also identify the genes that are the direct targets of this kind of selection.  Because experiments required to answer these questions would be impossible in humans or agricultural species, the project will use a vertebrate animal that has well-known natural history, ecology, and behavior, and for which the genome sequence has recently become available (the Trinidad guppy).  These small fish have high genetic diversity for body color, and this research will examine competing ideas about why: (1) fish with rare patterns survive better, or (2) fish with rare patterns reproduce more successfully.  This project will also produce educational material and activities for school children.  This material will enhance students' understanding of genetics, ecology, and evolutionary biology by using an animal with which many students are already familiar since guppies are popular in home aquariums.<br/><br/>Accounting for the persistence of high genetic diversity in ecologically-important traits is a fundamental problem in population genetics, and one that has fundamental implications for agriculture, medicine, and conservation biology.  Debate about what processes maintain variation has led to the development of important population-genetic principles and hypotheses, but the larger question remains unanswered.  This project will test the hypothesis that selection that varies in space or time (""balancing selection"") maintains genetic diversity in natural populations and will link these selective processes directly to the genetic variants they target. Researchers will combine genomic and ecological approaches in a species exhibiting one of the best-known cases of adaptive polymorphism, the colour patterns in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Field and laboratory studies of predator density, reproductive behavior, and color-pattern variation will determine which ecological processes promote genetic variation. Whole-genome sequencing of guppies from 13 natural populations will identify regions of the genome enriched for intermediate-frequency alleles; using data from many populations will allow us to differentiate between loci under balancing selection and those that are polymorphic because of non-selective processes such as random genetic drift and migration. This multipronged approach will enable linking evolutionary processes that maintain variation directly to the genetic variants (polymorphisms) they target."

Molecular dynamics codes that utilize parallel computation on CPUs and GPUs are relatively well developed, however, there are a number of problems that cannot be simulated with this methodology. Specifically, problems that require the simulation of an open system, such as adsorption in porous materials, require an alternative methodology that allows for fluctuation in the number of molecules in the system.  In addition, there are a number of systems where the presence of large free energy barriers and slow diffusion preclude the use of standard molecular dynamics.  Notable examples include the prediction of phase equilibria in multi-component lipid bilayers, or polymers.  For these types of problems, Monte Carlo or hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations have the potential to significantly improve computational efficiency.  This project is focused on the development of the open-source Monte Carlo simulation engine, GOMC, which is able to use low cost graphics processing units (GPUs) and multi-core processors (CPUs) to significantly reduce computational time.  This effort will enable Monte Carlo simulations to be performed with higher fidelity and for larger systems than is currently accessible with standard Monte Carlo simulation codes, enabling the accelerated development of new materials by domain scientists. In addition, this project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in Monte Carlo simulation, design of efficient algorithms for parallel computation on a variety of hardware architectures, and software development.  Tutorials and other educational materials will be created to support the use of GOMC for teaching Monte Carlo simulation of molecular systems to students in undergraduate and graduate courses at Wayne State as well as other universities. The free distribution of GOMC, along with the tutorials for using the software, will enable other research groups to solve important research problems quickly and accurately. This project, supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC), and the divisions of Material Research and Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) in the Directorate of Engneering, will result in software that enables new and better science. It also serves the educational mission of the National, through its active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Parallelization of Monte Carlo is complicated by the inherently sequential nature of the algorithm, which limits the reuse of code from molecular dynamics, and necessitates the development of new approaches.  The team's previous efforts have shown that despite the sequential nature of Monte Carlo, graphics processors (GPU) and multi-core CPUs can be used to yield significant reductions in wall-clock time required for a given calculation compared to a traditional serial CPU Monte Carlo code.  This effort led to the creation of the open-source Monte Carlo simulation engine GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC).  This work will add significant functional and computational enhancements to be added to GOMC.  These enhancements include: (1) support for polarizable force fields based on the Drude oscillator and AMOEBA models, (2) advanced configurational bias moves, such as concerted rotation, double bridging, and aggregation-volume bias (3) multi-molecule moves (4) hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations (5) new optimizations for multi-core and GPU architectures. The project will enable the simulation of large systems (>100,000 atoms) at constant chemical potential, providing insight into a broad array of problems such as polymer, lipid and ionic liquid phase behavior, molecular self-assembly, the stabilization of nano and micro particle dispersions for drug delivery, and membrane fusion under physiologically relevant conditions."

Establishing the intersecting causes and consequences of political and social instability as tied to language is of interest to national security.  The purpose of the Political Instability and Language Endangerment Conference is to develop a thorough understanding of how political instability and violence break apart communities and erode their ability to pass down their written and spoken word.  This interdisciplinary conference will bring together experts from political science, linguistics and other fields to develop a global and comprehensive account of the intersection of politics and language endangerment. Broader impacts include the engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are first generation and themselves from underrepresented groups, by providing networking and co-authoring opportunities to mentor students and to provide  training that will be invaluable in both private and public sector work.<br/> <br/>Led by an interdisciplinary team of linguists and political scientists from the University of North Texas, the Political Instability and Language Endangerment Conference will integrate knowledge from both disciplines and will produce new strategies for interdisciplinary research. The dominant paradigm for understanding the causes of language endangerment takes into consideration local social and economic factors. The potential for a more comprehensive understanding is possible through the perspective of political science which takes into account the role of violence, power and resources in societies and across institutions of governance.  In order to stimulate research utilizing this novel interdisciplinary perspective, conference participants will explore (1) how government policy, instability due to war and other forms of conflict lead to language endangerment; (2) how instability due to economically forced immigration contributes to language endangerment; and (3) how political conflict due to language endangerment and national language policies can lead to political protest, unrest and violence.  The resulting white paper and edited volume will be invaluable resources for practitioners, academics, and most importantly, the affected communities to develop strategies for language preservation. A follow-up conference envisioned for the Smithsonian Institution will help raise greater public awareness of this phenomenon."

A nonlocal interaction can be illustrated by its contrast to a local interaction in a simplified picture of a population of agents (say, people) interacting across a shared network.  A local model is one in which people can share information only with their immediate neighbors, whereas a nonlocal model is one in which they can share information more broadly, possibly across an entire network, and do so instantly.  This simplified picture actually manifests itself in many situations in which a nonlocal paradigm is more fruitful than a local one, and the inclusion of nonlocal interactions often fundamentally changes the underlying mathematics that describe aspects such as the propagation of information.  This project aims to improve the study of such phenomena through the introduction of new mathematical tools.  Along the way, this project will support the mentoring of graduate students and undergraduates through involvement in research on these topics. It will also create new graduate course material that provides a more unified approach to nonlocal tools of use in treating certain current topics in data science.  <br/><br/>In the realm of mathematics surrounding nonlocal problems, there has been a surge of activity during the past twenty years.  Experts have found themselves addressing questions in roughly two categories: (1) What properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of nonlocality itself; and (2) what properties of nonlocal equations should be studied for the sake of integrating them with other fields?  In this project the principal investigators focus on the second type of question.  They aim to develop nonlocal tools that can be applied to some classical problems that are not, at first glance, necessarily nonlocal, including questions about oscillatory boundary-layer phenomena for elliptic equations and free-boundary problems of one or two phases. The key point is that there are powerful tools in the nonlocal world that could shed new light upon or produce new results for some of these equations that were not approached from this perspective earlier. Such tools include, but are not limited to, the fast growing regularity theory for nonlocal equations and theory of weak solutions for nonlocal equations (still in its infancy).  Through representation techniques for general (nonlinear) operators that enjoy a global comparison principle, the principal investigators hope to bridge the gap between some aspects of these previously disjoint classes of equations and to use this ""nonlocal"" bridge as a pathway to new discoveries."

Some animals evolve to advertise to potential predators that they are poisonous (warning coloration). Different toxic species may converge on the same color pattern, giving both an advantage by more effectively advertising to predators. This is known as Müllerian mimicry, a focus of interest because it involves multiple phenomena that lie at the heart of our understanding of evolutionary processes. The genetic basis of mimicry is of special interest, because it provides a window into how these key evolutionary processes unfold. This research will focus on discovering the genetic underpinnings of Müllerian mimicry in a species of poison frog that has undergone an evolutionary radiation across different geographic regions of Peru. In each region, the mimic poison frog has evolved a different color pattern (such as stripes, bands, or spots), to resemble another species in that region. The evolution of these new color patterns may be driving reproductive isolation between populations of the mimic poison frog, leading to speciation and the creation of new biodiversity.

The results of the project will be used to enhance K12 education through classroom presentations, public lectures and museum displays.<br/> <br/>This project focuses on four specific aims: 1. Identify key genetic factors involved in color pattern development in the mimic poison frog by investigating differential gene expression across developmental stages and color pattern morphs, using next generation sequencing to produce stage-specific transcriptomes for each morph, which will be assembled to analyze patterns of differential gene expression. 2. Identify the causal gene(s) underlying differences in color pattern between morphs using genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture sequences) to screen transition zone samples (from three transition zones) and enable admixture mapping to discover candidate genes. 3. Test the association of specific candidate loci with color pattern using multigenerational pedigrees. 4. Test specific hypotheses regarding selection and demographic processes in the transition zones and between mimics and models, using new analytical tools. Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing approaches will elucidate the genetic underpinnings and population genomics of color pattern evolution and diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison frogs."

The current situation surrounding the uncertainty in the knowledge of G is puzzling the fundamental physics and precision measurement communities. The world's best experiments yield values which are incompatible with one another and differ by about 40 times the uncertainty of the most precise experiment. Furthermore, knowing the true value of G is important in various fields, as it is necessary in efforts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics in a quantum theory of gravity. The project enabled by this collaboration will be to carry out carefully controlled metrological experiments where the precision of the measurements will be in the part-per-million. Since part of the past discrepancies between determinations of G can be traced back to the methodology used, the group will combine different approaches to determine G within the same apparatus, hoping to obtain highly precise values of G from each approach, but with the expectation that the values obtained using different methodologies will mimic the current situation in the community, namely, that different methodologies, no matter how precise, yield different results. With the experiments carried out in the same apparatus our effort would then help understand the current discrepancies among existing experimental results.<br/><br/>The project will establish a torsion pendulum facility dedicated to measuring the Newtonian gravitational constant G with unprecedented sensitivity using three different experimental techniques within the same apparatus. An agreed upon value for G remains elusive as recent measurements by different experimental groups have scattered widely, or have had low precision. The spread in measured values and the relatively low precision of the measurements is recognized by the precision measurement community as something that needs to be addressed. This project will build a system based upon the ideas introduced in previous torsion pendulum experiments, but will expand the scope and breadth of the measurements by the multi-mode nature of the apparatus. In the primary mode G will be determined by measuring the angular acceleration needed to keep a torsion pendulum's fiber from twisting while it rotates on a turntable in the presence of carefully designed attractor masses (that also rotate on a separate turntable). This angular acceleration feedback mode has yielded the most precise measurement of G to date, yet it has only been performed once. Compared to previous efforts, the proposed system will achieve smaller metrology errors by using advanced measurement and characterization techniques. Using the same apparatus, G will be determined by measuring the change in the resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum with the attractor masses present and removed by measuring the thermally induced oscillation of the pendulum. In the third approach, G will be determined by large amplitude determination of the change in the resonant frequency of the pendulum when the attractor masses are at two different positions. Each technique is expected to provide a measurement with a relative error of approximately 2 ppm. The measurements performed within this project will be of broad interest to scientists in diverse fields of physics and metrology, and the approach may shed light on why previous experiments have resulted in discrepant measurements of G. In addition to broad scientific interest, undergraduate and graduate students will be integral to the success of the project. They will be trained in experimental physics and precision measurement techniques. The project will provide training and education for first-generation college students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds by recruiting from a rural, federally-recognized Hispanic Serving Institution that has limited research opportunities on campus. Students from three different universities will be in contact, enhancing their exposure to different academic cultures and providing networking opportunities. As part of the proposed activities, demonstrations associated with the principles of forces will be developed and used at community gathering events, recruiting events and in classroom environments."

This export is especially pronounced in the Midwestern U.S., where large areas of agriculture have left exposed soils that easily wash away during storms. These large pulses of sediments and nutrients to lakes during storms can affect drinking water quality, recreational opportunities, and commercial and sport fishing. It is expected that storms in the Midwestern U.S. will increase in severity and frequency over the next 100 years. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to understand how lakes will respond to storms under these changing conditions. In addition, this project will directly support the research of one doctoral student, and will provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will experimentally examine what factors contribute to lake ecosystem resilience following storm events, using replicated aquatic mesocosms (5000 liter tanks) that simulate conditions during large storm events in a lake. This research will answer three general questions: (1) Do larger detritus pools speed lake resilience (the time necessary for ecosystems to recover) following large storm events? (2) How do additions of sediment and nutrients that occur during large storm events affect lake recovery time? and (3) How do additions of sediment and nutrients and detritus pool size interactively affect lake resilience? The experiment will include manipulations of detritus pool size, hydraulic flushing (a physical disturbance that reduces the amount of algae), and addition of sediment and nutrients. A factorial design will be used to isolate the mechanisms that influence lake recovery following large storm events. Understanding how these factors interact is essential to understanding ecosystem resilience and for effective management of water quality in lakes and reservoirs."

This project brings these concepts and techniques to bear in a new field: large-scale distributed computing. The modern paradigm for large-scale distributed computing systems is driven by  ""scaling out"" of computations across clusters consisting of as many as tens or hundreds of thousands of machines. As such, there is an abundance of resource redundancy that can be exploited. This project develops a foundation for ""coded computing"", a new framework that combines coding with distributed computing to overcome several fundamental challenges limiting the performance of today's large-scale distributed computing platforms. The research outcomes of the project will be integrated into education and will be disseminated broadly. <br/><br/>This project takes a principled and foundational approach to providing a unified coding framework to tackle three key challenges in large-scale distributed computing: significant delays due to straggling nodes; large communication loads between computing nodes; and massive input data-sets. In particular, three novel coding concepts are proposed for distributed computing: coding for injecting computation redundancy to mitigate straggler issues; coding to trade local computation with global communication; and coding for statistically principled data sketching. The unified role of codes in both doing fast sketching and in providing robustness to straggler node delays and communication bottlenecks is also studied."

This project will analyze how human-environment interactions within agricultural landscapes are being reshaped by the introduction of hydraulic fracturing, as farmers decide whether or not to permit shale gas development on their land. In this way, the project responds to a pressing need for scientific research on the impacts of the hydraulic fracturing boom on farmer-landowners in the US.  The study will produce new insights about how farmers act as environmental citizens in relation to state-level shale gas development policy, land grant college extension programs, and the production of environmental knowledge. Working at the interface of political ecology, science and technology studies and Q methodology, the study will move beyond simplistic representations of the complex practices of shale gas development and lay the groundwork for building consensus by identifying areas of convergence between farmer-landowners representing different orientations to hydraulic fracturing. The doctoral student will work with local land grant colleges to share the research findings at regional agricultural conferences and with diverse stakeholders in the shale gas development debate.<br/><br/>This project employs a mixed methods approach to analyze farmer perceptions of hydraulic fracturing. The central research question asks: How are human-environment relationships being reconfigured at the intersection of hydraulic fracturing and agricultural production? The research will examine the Twin Tiers region of Pennsylvania and New York as a case study to examine how divergent state-level policies may impact perceptions of hydraulic fracturing. The doctoral student will use Q methodology, a method of statistically analyzing subjective viewpoints, to identify how farmers experience hydraulic fracturing on their land. The use of Q methodology will also identify areas of convergence that may be used to build consensus among diverse stakeholders in the hydraulic fracturing debate. These findings will be supplemented with interviews to provider greater depth and detail while interpreting the results of the Q method study. Additionally, the doctoral student will use critical discourse analysis to examine how social contexts impact the ways in which human-environment interactions are shaped. These findings will inform local stakeholders, land grant colleges, and policy makers by highlighting potential areas of consensus between opposing viewpoints on hydraulic fracturing."

The primary focus of the project will be at the middle school and early high school level, a pivotal time during which students' self-concepts about and interest in pursuing mathematics are crystallized.  To this end, through funding from Track 3: Master Teacher Fellowships of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, ATMALA will create a cadre of 20 Master Teaching Fellows. The project's Master Teaching Fellows will be teacher-leaders in high impact districts serving a significant population of English language learners, who will not only model effective instructional practice but will also support their peers in learning to do so. ATMALA will offer a model for supporting instructional shifts in schools where students historically have had less access to deep mathematics learning. The Master Teaching Fellows will become experts in their use of culturally responsive mathematics teaching (CRMT)- an approach that values students' cultural assets and focuses on authentic and relevant mathematical experiences - and the eight Mathematics Teaching Practices (MTPs) identified by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. As a result, they will become leaders in their districts who support current and future colleagues in their use of CRMT and the MTPs. To accomplish these goals, each Master Teaching Fellow will: (1) work to earn National Board Certification; (2) demonstrate competency in using CRMT and the MTPs; (3) support colleagues' professional growth by creating and facilitating engagement with microcredential modules, each focused on a well-defined skill related to CRMT and the MTPs; and (4) support future teachers as cooperating teachers.<br/><br/>Project ATMALA is a collaboration between California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), the Anaheim Union High School District, and National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (non-profit organization). This Track 3 project supporting 20 carefully selected and prepared Master Teaching Fellows will build on the success of CSU Fullerton's Mathematics Teaching and Master Teaching Fellows project (NSF Award #1035315, 2010-2016) and Transforming Academic and Cultural Identidad through Bilteracy project (NSF Award #1321339, 2013-2016). The implementation of project ATMALA will result in a model of teacher-led professional development in high impact districts built around National Board Certification, principles of culturally responsive teaching, research-based mathematics teaching practices, and microcredential modules that promote competency-based teacher development. Project activities will be documented and evaluated in formative and summative reports. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to identify evidence-based outcomes related to teacher practices including examining students' perceptions of the mathematics learning environment in their classrooms. ATMALA leaders and participants will produce substantive dissemination works, including national presentations, refereed journal articles, and microcredential modules made widely available through collaboration with CSUF's University Extended Education."

Synapses are essential for the cell-to-cell communication that nervous systems need to function properly, and are created after threadlike cellular projections, known as axons, reach another target cell. One step in synapse formation involves removing extra material from axons by a process called autophagy. The present research project examines the precise role of one key protein (UNC-33/CRMP-2) that is known from previous work to affect axon growth and maintenance. Experiments use the roundworm C. elegans because of the advantages it offers for genetic manipulation and live cell imaging. Genetic lesions will be introduced in the gene coding for UNC-33/CRMP2, and the hypothesis that this molecule simultaneously regulates autophagy and synapse development will be tested using sophisticated cellular imaging and analysis techniques. This study has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of neuronal circuits, as well as to a better understanding of defects in the growth and maintenance of synapses that are characteristic of a range of neurological diseases including autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. Moreover, this research will be carried out with the assistance of, and support the training of, undergraduate students at Southwestern Oklahoma State University.  This project includes a variety of outreach programs for local elementary and high schools, and educational engagement with the general public on topics related to brain development and function.<br/><br/>Despite the wealth of information surrounding neurodevelopment and neuronal survival, it is still unclear why neuronal components shown to work at the level of axonal outgrowth and cytoskeleton stability bind to components of the autophagy machinery.  Moreover, it is undetermined why autophagy gene products, first characterized in yeast as Atg1, 6, 8, 9, 13, 18, are enriched in the nervous system. To shed light on the link of autophagy and neuronal development and survival, the investigators propose to characterize the role of UNC-33 in neuronal autophagy. The nematode unc-33 gene encodes for conserved members of the CRMP/TOAD/Ulip/DRP family of proteins. In C. elegans, UNC-33 isoforms mediate axonal guidance and axonogenesis in neurons. Moreover, preliminary investigations show that unc-33 mutants have a defect in dauer larva formation, an arrested developmental stage that survives in harsh environments due to enhanced cellular autophagy.   In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that autophagy and UNC-33 serve to protect against defects in neuronal development and/or neuronal stability. In aim 1, they will define the role of UNC-33 in autophagy in neurons. In aim 2, they will characterize the role of basal autophagy in the maintenance of long-lived cells such as neurons. In aim 3, they propose to uncover the mechanism underlying the synthetic lethality of unc-33; daf-2 double mutants. Together, these studies will advance understanding of both autophagy and neuronal development and maintenance; will significantly enhance undergraduate education and the integration of research in the classroom; and will promote outreach to local communities."

They also play a key role in forcing the circulation patterns, and thus are central to our understanding and prediction of weather and climate. Because these processes occur at spatial scales smaller than that of the grid sizes of global weather and climate models, they need to be related to large-scale flow statistically in numerical models, or represented by parameterizations. The success of parameterizations demands physically based and process-level understanding of the moist convective processes. This project focuses on one important aspect of moist convections, namely cold pools. When rain evaporates into unsaturated air, it cools the air and increases its density, causing it to sink to the surface and spread out horizontally as a density current. These density currents are known as cold pools. They can trigger new storms (which is responsible for the gusty winds and cooler air that one experiences preceding a storm), modify near-surface fluxes, atmospheric stability, and affect the characteristics and development of convective clouds.  In this project, high-resolution numerical simulations that explicitly resolve the cold pools and processes that produce them are used along with innovative particle tracking to unravel the many factors that contribute to the birth, evolution, and demise of cold pools, as well as to quantify how cold pools modify the characteristics of moist convections and how to represent these effects statistically in global models of weather and climate.<br/><br/>Clouds and convection remain major sources of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions. By improving process-level understanding and representation of a key feature of convective clouds, this research will help reduce such uncertainties. This research will also strengthen collaboration between university scientists and train postdoctoral scientists, and contribute to the development of weather and climate models."

An important reason few plants and animals disappeared is that they may have been able to move into climate refugia. Climate refugia are hospitable areas that are resilient to changing environmental conditions over long periods of time.  Resilient areas have continued to maintain plant and animal diversity for thousands of years and have the potential to do so into the future. This study uses the fossil pollen record of North America plant species to understand the factors that promoted the existence of climate refugia during glacial periods. This study will also examine how long these refugia lasted and how important they were for the survival of plants. Identifying regions that may be important for preserving species and understanding their importance during changing environmental conditions will inform conservation decisions. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and provide research experiences for undergraduate students in the areas of paleoecology, landscape ecology, and conservation biology.  The researchers will also include the public and conservation practitioners in presentations and activities that stress the role of resilience in the preservation of biodiversity.<br/><br/>Resilience, a measure of the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem can undergo without switching states, is a fundamental ecological concept that determines species stability, community composition, and biogeographic changes over time. Several hypotheses exist concerning what climate and landscape determinants make a region more resilient to changing climatic conditions, including relatively low rates of 1) changing conditions and 2) climate velocity, and high 3) climate and 4) landscape diversity. However these hypothesized determinants of resilience lack support because relatively short ecological time periods are insufficient to identify areas that are climate resilient.  An important strategy for identifying and understanding currently resilient areas is to test hypothesized determinants of resilience against areas that have been independently identified as resilient in the fossil record. To accomplish this, this project will test the determinants of resilience against two historical datasets: 1) the North American fossil pollen record for the last 10,000 years, which provides long-term record of change in plant community compositions, and 2) identified Pleistocene refugia. The use of the fossil record has the potential to transform our understanding of how landscape, climate, and ecosystem dynamics interact to create resilient areas and will potentially validate the mechanisms behind these causal hypotheses."

Although women?s share in STEM employment has been growing in non-computer science occupations, their share in computer science occupations has been declining since the 1990s.  Because computer science occupations account for 50% of STEM workers, this decline is slowing the growth of women?s share in STEM fields overall, and suggests significant untapped potential that could improve US productivity and competitiveness.  One reason that women may not seek out or remain in computer science fields is that they are treated differently than men during the hiring process.<br/><br/>This project uses a laboratory experiment in the field on first-line hiring managers to determine first if there is differential treatment of women in hiring recent computer science graduates. If there is such a difference, it will determine the characteristics of women who are more likely to be treated negatively as well as general characteristics of firms that are more likely to exhibit differential treatment.  Resumes will be randomly generated to include different characteristics that, if their inclusion helps women more than men, will indicate potential reasons for this differential treatment. The experiment will also use eye-tracking to determine how recruiters visually process computer science resumes and whether or not there are differences between how they process male vs. female resumes.  These combined results will help to differentiate between economic theories of discrimination, and will advance social science by increasing our theoretical understanding of when and how differential treatment occurs. Results from this study can be used to make recommendations to individuals applying for these positions and  institutions which advise them, to employers who desire to hire the best candidates, and to policy makers who want to increase meritocratic hiring in STEM.  The results will thus lead to a more diverse and competitive workforce, increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S.<br/><br/>This project combines two cutting-edge methodologies, eye-tracking and resume-randomization, to study gender discrimination at the first stage of the STEM hiring process. It will determine if there is differential treatment by gender in how first-line hiring managers treat resumes, whether the treatment is similar or different along the applicant quality distribution, and if there are industry characteristics (ex. firm size, industry code) that would lead to higher or lower levels of differential treatment.  Finally, this study will differentiate between different theories of statistical and taste-based discrimination.<br/>Technical recruiters in charge of first-line interview decisions will be solicited at university recruitment fairs and industry fairs to view and process hypothetical resumes for Computer Science majors. They will be asked to follow their standard hiring practice and to choose resumes to ?move to the next stage.? The resumes will then be redisplayed and participants will rate each resume and give the expected starting salary and position. While participants are viewing the resumes, their eye-movements will be tracked via an eye-tracking device. Following the resume rating exercise, they will answer a short demographic survey.<br/><br/>Resumes with randomized inputs based on actual resumes will be created via a randomization program. Outcomes of interest include information on ratings, moving the resume to the next stage, position placement, salary ranges, time spent on individual resumes, time spent on and number of looks at specific parts of resumes. The coefficients and significance on the coefficient of gender determine whether or not there is differential treatment by gender, and if so, for which women and by what kinds of firms. Time spent on resumes by gender interacted with differential treatment findings provide information on use of heuristics in the decision-making process. Time spent viewing specific parts of the resume (areas of interest or AOI) and tracking the order that recruiters view parts of the resume provide insight into their decision-making processes. Gender interactions with randomized inputs that support or contradict stereotypes will be used to test employee taste-based discrimination and levels-based statistical discrimination. Position placement by gender will test customer taste-based discrimination. Comparing predicted outcomes with actual outcomes by gender of resume be used to test variance-based statistical discrimination.<br/><br/>This project directly impacts the full participation of women in STEM and will (1) improve the well-being of individuals in society, (2) develop a diverse and competitive workforce and (3) increase economic competitiveness. Results from this study can be used to make recommendations to individuals applying for these positions and the institutions who advise them, to employers who desire to hire the best candidates, and to policy makers who want more women and minorities in STEM. The methodology will (4) promote future research on other hiring and discrimination questions. In addition, this project will (5) incorporate graduate and undergraduate students, involving them in cutting-edge research and providing them with a platform to undertake their own independent work. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive mentoring and research skills, increasing their attractiveness to employers and advanced degree programs."

A modified t-cavity vertical external cavity surface emitting laser (VECSEL) is to operate in the 240-260nm range with pulse widths <10ps and peak powers >10W. The proposed design will eliminate the need for expensive and inefficient cavity stabilization electronics and will push the boundaries in various fields including: nonlinear optics, semiconductor lasers, cavity design, and ultrafast pulse generation. As part of the research, a new VECSEL gain material will be designed and grown to deliver the large gain bandwidth needed for short pulse generation while still providing high peak powers. This new gain material combined with a semiconductor absorber mirror in a t-cavity configuration will allow development of a new laser source that can enable future advancements in science, medicine, material processing, and engineering research. In addition, this research group will provide an excellent research experience for individuals from under-represented groups through REU programs and undergraduate research. Two undergraduate students are to be involved each year for summer and/or academic internship.  <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The proposed research will implement a novel t-cavity configuration for fourth harmonic generation and eliminate the need for cavity stabilization electronics. Typically, fourth harmonic generation to the UV uses a source laser that is coupled into a series of external resonator cavities that recirculate the fundamental and second harmonic modes. These external cavities are very sensitive to minor movements which lead to phase variations of the beams and to large power fluctuations of the UV output. This situation requires that each cavity have their resonances locked to ensure stable outputs. Such systems are large, complicated, and expensive which limits their potential use outside of a laboratory environment. The proposed research will eliminate the need of the external cavity due to the all-internal nature of the design. Here, the fundamental field is frequency doubled in a nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal for second harmonic generation. As the frequency doubled field is orthogonally polarized to the fundamental, an intra-cavity polarizing beam splitter expels this field into an alternate cavity path. While this is not a resonant cavity, the difficulty of injecting the light into an external resonator is eliminated. The second harmonic is generated inside this cavity and creates a large field in which another NLO crystal can efficiently frequency double this field to the UV. While stabilization electronics would improve the field build-up in the cavity, the research is focused on obtaining a stable high peak power output without additional elements."

White oak forests provide numerous material and non-material benefits to society that include commercial timber products, habitat for animal species, and cultural value.  Historically white oaks were an essential component of eastern U.S. forests, being the most abundant tree in forests prior to Euro-American settlement. However, white oak abundance has declined over the past two centuries, motivating this study to understand the reasons for high abundance in the past and the reasons for their decline. The project will investigate two significant processes that likely contributed to white oak abundance in the eighteenth century: vegetation burning by Native Americans to maintain open landscapes, and the occurrence of high-severity droughts that favored drought-tolerant species such as white oak.  The project will analyze present-day forests to understand environmental and historical land-use conditions under which white oak forests persist or decline. To comprehend the human dimensions of oak decline, the project will assess economic and cultural values that stakeholder groups, including Native American communities, ascribe to white oak trees and forests. The research will provide undergraduate student training, including those traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, with field and lab-based educational experiences in STEM fields, specifically in geographic information systems, tree-ring analysis, and statistical modeling. The outcomes of this project will contribute new knowledge for managing oak landscapes to meet economic, ecological, and cultural goals. The framework and methods are scalable to other ecosystems with shared Euro- and Native American land-use legacies. Project findings will be widely shared with entities such as state and federal land management agencies, the Seneca Nation of Indians, and land conservancies. Findings will also be communicated through various means, including a book.<br/><br/>This research will be conducted in the forests of northern New York state and focuses on three central research questions: (1) Were environmental factors or Native American land-use practices responsible for the high abundance of oak and other xeric (dry-site) tree species in the past? (2) Under what environmental and land-use conditions have white oaks regenerated or declined? (3) What material and non-material benefits do white oak trees and forests provide communities in the eastern United States?  Historical records will provide insight into landscape characteristics and land-use practices during late Native American (ca. 1790) and early Euro-American (ca. 1790-1850) settlement period, and will be used to construct a land-use history. Statistical models will determine relationships between past forest composition, environmental conditions (e.g. topography, soils), and Native American land-use.  Dendrochronological studies will be conducted using tree-core samples extracted from remaining old trees to assess patterns of tree growth in relation to drought patterns and land-use changes. Modern tree species composition will be compared with environmental conditions (e.g. soils) and land-use histories to understand settings under which white oak persisted or declined. Surveys and interviews of stakeholders in the study area will be used to ascertain the present-day economic and cultural values associated with white oaks."

The molecular clock consists of positive and negative components that form a feedback loop that underlies brain rhythms. However, ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,"" and we do not yet know how a handful of components coordinate to give rise to emergent daily rhythms. Therefore, this research aims to identify the biochemical properties of core clock proteins that enable rhythmic behavior. To do this, the team has developed an integrative approach that combines cell-based genetics and continuous monitoring of circadian behavior with biochemical/biophysical methods. This approach will allow them to study the function of clock proteins not only in test tubes in isolation, but also in the context of oscillatory behavior in interacting cells. This work will reveal how the ""gears and springs"" of the clock interact and function together, and this knowledge will increase our understanding of how the brain keeps time, as well as how proteins interact to regulate complex brain functions. The PI and his colleagues will teach a lecture/lab course that uses a ""from math to genes to behavior"" platform and provides cross-disciplinary training for graduate students. The team will also teach real world concepts in the local community about the health implications of circadian rhythms, which relates to people of all backgrounds and ages. These broader impacts will strengthen the nation's scientific infrastructure and improve people's health awareness. <br/><br/>Technical Paragraph <br/><br/>Genetic studies have identified several core clock components that form a negative feedback mechanism, which underlies circadian behavior. It is well established that, in the core feedback loop, BMAL1 and CLOCK are the two transcription activators and CRY serves as the chief repressor. However, negative feedback in transcription does not necessarily warrant recurring cellular processes with a ~24 hr periodicity. The circadian rhythm is an emergent property enabled by the core clock factors, but the biochemical basis of cellular circadian oscillation is not well understood. Recent studies from this research team show that the structurally flexible C-termini of BMAL1 and CLOCK play essential roles in regulating dynamic interactions with other clock factors to enable circadian oscillations. In the proposed research, the team will employ an integrated approach that combines cell-based genetics and kinetic bioluminescence assays with biochemical and biophysical methods to study how their C-termini use dynamic interactions to regulate rhythm amplitude and period length. In this way, protein function is assessed both in vitro and in the context of cellular circadian behavior. By providing a biochemical basis of cellular circadian behavior, this research will define the molecular architecture of the circadian transcription complex, advance current understanding of the negative feedback mechanism, and further the goals of behavioral neurobiology. During the research, the PI and his colleagues will provide cross-disciplinary education and training for graduate students and inform the general public about the important health implications of circadian rhythms."

The growth of new faults presents a significant challenge for accurate assessments of earthquake hazards in seismically active regions of the world. Prediction of new fault growth would allow better understanding of the development of active fault systems. Through the accumulation of many earthquakes that each incrementally advance the fault system development, an initial distribution of 1 cm cracks can evolve into a 100-km long fault capable of damaging earthquakes. Because fault growth happens across a wide range of spatial scales and in the subsurface, geologists are unable to directly observe the growth of a new fault. This project uses a combination of physical laboratory experiments and computer models that simulate fault growth to explore this problem in the absence of direct observation. The computer models build on the idea that new faults grow to minimize work and achieve a lower energy state. The computer predictions, which will be compared with laboratory experiments, will simulate the development of new faults in front of an accretionary wedge, the Nankai trough south of Tokyo, Japan. This extremely well imaged subduction zone provides good constraints for testing the crustal fault growth models. The Nankai trough has produced several devastating earthquakes and insights learned from this subduction zone will guide our understanding of other subduction zones such as Cascadia margin off Seattle and the Aleutians in Alaska. Additional desired societal outcomes include full participation of women and persons with disabilities in STEM, development of a diverse competitive STEM workforce through graduate student and post-doctoral researcher training, international collaboration, and enhanced infrastructure for research by development and distribution of new computer modeling code.<br/><br/>Accretionary prisms are ideal locations for the study of fault development because the material incorporated at the toe of the prism is relatively un-faulted. Field observations suggest that through-going, prism-scale faults develop via the interaction and linkage of smaller fractures within accretionary systems. This coalescence results in the localization of strain along discrete faults from initially diffuse strain along many small fractures. This project examines the evolution of crack coalescence to fault formation within both scaled physical experiments and the Nankai prism. Accretionary systems will be modeled with an innovative new numerical code, GROW, which predicts fracture propagation through the optimization of external work. Crack coalescence will be simulated within four distinct systems: (1) biaxial and triaxial systems for validation with similarly loaded laboratory tests run at the University of Oslo, Norway, that use tomography to track crack coalescence;  (2) scaled physical experiments of accretion run at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, France, that provide known boundary conditions, material properties and detailed quantitative observations of the evolution of faulting and associated deformation; (3) accretion simulations of intermediate complexity and scale that provide a critical step between (2) and (4) and allow investigation of increasingly realistic parameters; and (4) simulation of the Kumano transect across the Nankai accretionary prism, which provides a well-constrained example of the development of in-sequence and out-of-sequence crustal thrusts. For the latter, the proposed megathrust development will be simulated over the past 2 Ma in several successive time intervals. All four suites of models will investigate fault development considering the premise that faults grow to optimize the total work on the system. Many of the models will initiate fault growth and coalescence from initial distributed seed points, that represent weak heterogeneities in the experiment and crust. For all suites of models, the evolving work budget within the systems reveals the competing influences of different deformation mechanisms. By investigating the relationship between strain localization, fracture interaction and various energy consuming processes within each system, the researchers will be able to compare the differences in these relationships between models of cm-scale, laboratory physical experiments and km-scale, natural orogens."

This project will serve as a platform for teaching undergraduate, community college, and high school students to appreciate biology, and also for mentoring graduate students. <br/><br/>The localization and targeting of RNAs to specific cellular regions and compartments has been identified as an important mechanism in controlling several cellular processes such as cell migration, neuronal signaling and development in a wide array of model organisms. A major impediment to the understanding of RNA localization studies, however, is the current absence of a good genome-wide method to identify RNAs localized in specific cellular compartments. The objective of the present project is to develop a novel and robust genomic method, TSA-RNA-seq to identify RNAs that are enriched in a specific cellular compartment.   TSA-RNA-seq will be developed in the context of a specific sub nuclear compartment called nuclear speckle. Nuclear speckles are dynamic structures enriched with proteins and RNAs involved in mRNA metabolism. Characterization of the mechanism/s that governs specific interactions between speckle-associated genes and RNAs would unravel the principles that define the contribution of nuclear speckles in gene expression and RNA maturation. The primary objectives of the project include: 1) Development of TSA-RNA-seq to identify nuclear speckle-resident RNAs. 2) Development of biochemical purification of speckles and to identify speckle-localized RNA. 3) Validation of speckle-resident RNA.

It will look at how being a member of a specific Community of Practice (CoP) influences teacher identity, belief in their personal teaching abilities, and desire to remain in the profession related to teacher retention. The institutions (SUNY at Stony Brook University, University of Kentucky, Kennesaw State University, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis) in this study span the U.S. and represent successful Noyce teacher preparation programs with a variety of recruitment strategies (e.g., career changers), induction support structures (e.g., online), and teacher placements (e.g., rural vs. urban). These six sites will also allow for a comparison of Noyce and non-Noyce teachers emerging from the different teacher preparation programs.  The goal is to determine whether a core set of program features contributes to the success of each induction program, or if distinct program features are useful for unique populations (e.g., periodic face-to-face meetings for career changers, or online support for urban teachers). The project also seeks to determine which program features lead to different community structures (e.g., collaborating mainly with teachers inside or outside the school), and how that community affects a teacher's perception of the profession (e.g., teacher is connected to professionals across the state and wants to remain in the profession as a career). The primary research methodology used in this research study is Social Network Analysis, which will be used to determine with whom teachers exchange information related to their teaching. The study will benefit the field by highlighting induction strategies appropriate and effective for diverse teacher groups, and lead to a desire for increased retention in the workforce. The study will inform workforce issues in the organizational sciences, in which limited work has explicitly adopted a social network approach to explain human resource outcomes.<br/><br/>The theory being examined in this project is the extent to which teacher identify formation linked to persistence in the profession can be detected in participants' social networks and correlated to Noyce preparation and induction features.  The three-stage research design will include documenting the antecedents of network formation, teacher networks, and the outcomes of networks. In Stage I, information will be collected about the support structures present at each site, and which activities and demographics represent the participants' experiences during induction. Coherence between the planned focus of each program, and the experiences of the participants, will be examined. In Stage II, social network information will be collected from participants using an ego-centric network survey (with data focused on a given teacher's local community of ties, e.g. the CoP) of who each teacher exchanges information with related to teaching content and pedagogy, how frequently the interactions occur, and whether the contacts occur in the local school or across regional, state, or national levels. Survey data will be transformed into matrices needed to generate STEM teacher networks, and examined for size, density, strength of ties, and geographic proximity to the teacher, utilizing the latest social network analysis software packages. Network properties from Stage II will be modeled using Stage I data to determine which activities and support structures contribute to different structural CoPs. In Stage III, teacher perceptions of their teaching self-efficacy, identity within the profession, and outlook on remaining in the profession will be collected. Stage III data will be modeled using Stage II network data to determine which CoPs influence desirable teacher outcomes. In order to strengthen claims of causality from the quantitative analyses, teachers will be asked which activities influence their CoP network, and which portions of the network effect their outcomes. Stage I and III instruments will be aligned to NSF Annual Participant Surveys, and Department of Education Teacher Follow-up Surveys, respectively, so results from this study may be generalized to national data in future studies."

REU students have access to the individual mentor's facilities as well as many core facilities such as advanced light microscopy, electron microscopy and tomography, next-generation DNA sequencing, and flow cytometry. Students are selected by an REU steering committee, on the basis of their academic record and perceived potential for outstanding research. The program is not appropriate for students who are planning to attend medical school.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

The conference will bring together experts in geometric group theory, computability theory and computer science to discuss recent developments and interactions between these subjects, and to create a roadmap for future cooperation.  The junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students attending the conference will benefit from interacting with senior researchers in several disciplines and establishing valuable professional connections and collaborations.  In addition to the regular scientific program, the conference will feature a presentation and a discussion on Wikipedia editing in Mathematics, including a practical how-to guide and demonstration.<br/><br/>Interaction with computation permeated the development of geometric group theory, from the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s, through the work of Turing in 1930s, the Novikov-Boone Theorem in the 1950s and the theory of word-hyperbolic and automatic groups in the 1990s, to the present day. Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/"

This project, building on the PI's Ph.D. dissertation research, investigates the connection of extratropical blocks to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), a prominent intra-seasonal (30-60 days) form of variability in the tropical atmosphere. A linear inverse modelling (LIM) approach is used to identify tropical diabatic heating anomalies associated with MJO that can evolve into blocking flows in the extratropics. <br/><br/>The research could be beneficial to regional decision makers by demonstrating how blocking events in a given region can be traced back to MJO events in the tropics, thus enabling advanced warning of blocking events and their impacts.

These crystals tend to grow rapidly, however, when exposed to cyclic external forces, limiting their practical utility as load-bearing structures. This award supports fundamental research to enable enhanced stability in nanocrystalline alloys and to uncover their behavior under cyclic loading conditions, by applying innovative alloy design and synthesis methods. Further, this project will develop a predictive framework which will identify suitable compositions of novel nanocrystalline alloys that will meet or exceed the performance of conventional alloys under cyclic loads, including rotating machinery and engine components critical to the transportation, defense and energy sectors. This interdisciplinary research will provide opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups, women, and persons with disabilities, and will directly raise public interest in science and engineering through creative outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>Metals with a mean grain size below 100 nm have inspired much research interest owing to their superior mechanical properties as compared to course-grained materials. However, despite the potential applicability of nanocrystalline alloys for load-bearing structures, very few studies have addressed the fundamental microstructural evolution under fatigue loads, specifically, grain size effects on fatigue processes. The critical gap in knowledge has stemmed from microstructural instability, i.e., grain growth and texture evolution observed during cyclic deformation. Motivated by this, the goals of this project are: (1) implementation of selective segregation of nanoclusters to lower the thermodynamic and kinetic driving forces for grain growth, and as a result, a clear understanding of the true microstructural grain size effects on salient fatigue growth mechanisms can be unraveled; and (2) to exploit the subsequent knowledge to reconcile key theories and hypotheses pertaining to fatigue crack growth behavior of nanocrystalline metals. The fatigue crack growth mechanisms as a function of grain size quantified in this project have broad scientific ramifications as this knowledge is highly relevant for designing and synthesizing nanocrystalline alloys with optimal microstructures, and for accurate predictive simulations."

This project seeks to test the emancipation hypothesis proposed by Tinbergen 60 years ago to understand how a novel behavior arises by using a hybrid zone between two species of hummingbirds. The novel behavior is a courtship display that is performed by one species, Allen's Hummingbird, and not the other, Rufous Hummingbird. In this stereotyped display, called the 'pendulum display', the male flies back and forth over a female while producing distinctive sounds with his wings. The investigators will record displays from 400 birds from within a hybrid zone between these two species, and then search for genes associated with individual components of the behavior, by sequencing the genomes of these 400 birds. Understanding how one behavior splits into two will reveal a fundamental mechanism of how behavior evolves.  Additionally, this grant will train of students of diverse backgrounds, and enable outreach to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside by funding purchase of an 'acoustic camera', allowing deaf children to learn more about sound through this newly invented way of visualizing it. <br/><br/>As the genetic underpinnings of how one behavior splits into two 'paramorphs', alternate forms of a previously unitary character, have not been demonstrated for any behavior, the analyses presented here aim to do so for the first time. This 3-year study has three objectives: (1) Hybrid zone mapping and cline analysis: phenotype, genotype, and selection (2): Sequence analysis of complex display behavior, and (3): Admixture mapping of behavior and morphology. Together these objectives will provide information about selection on the display traits of interest, and test the paramorph hypothesis directly, using phenotypic and genotypic data respectively. Current data indicate no fixed genetic differences between the species within coding regions of the genome, hinting that the paramorphic behavior could be driven by differences in gene regulation between the two species, rather than as the result of a paralogous gene.  Just as the modern view of morphological diversity was transformed by the study of its genetic basis, a direct assessment of the genes underlying a behavior that varies across a hybrid zone will allow one of the first tests of how a complex motor pattern has evolved. This project will build infrastructure through addition of sound, video, and specimens to the Macaulay Library at Cornell University, San Diego Natural History Museum and the SDSU Museum of Biodiversity."

Lab studies have shown that warm-blooded organisms lose heat at a more rapid rate when wet and must spend more energy to regulate body temperature. Effects of rainfall on energy expenditure in the wild is unstudied, but may critically affect reproduction and survival of organisms. Energy is often most limited to animals when trying to raise offspring, with the latter especially vulnerable to increased energy costs of wetting because of poorly developed fur or feathers. This project examines energy costs of rainfall to parents and their offspring in tropical songbirds. Tropical organisms provide an important test because they are thought to be sensitive to heat loss and thermal conditions due to the narrow temperature variation in the tropics. Also, rain is a prevalent feature in tropical rain forests (often > 2 m per year).  Investigations will examine energy expenditure of both parents and offspring on dry versus wet days and at nests where rainfall is experimentally modified. Measurements will be conducted across diverse species that differ in their behaviors, nest types and potential exposure to rain to advance understanding of the energetic costs and differential population vulnerabilities of species as a result of variation in rainfall. This work has important conservation implications because it identifies population sensitivities of endemic species in a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, many students from a variety of disciplines, including those outside of biology will be trained in the conduct of field work and scientific principles. <br/><br/>Ecological and evolutionary influences of precipitation are poorly studied. Proposed work will significantly advance understanding of the energetic (field metabolic rates) and demographic consequences of variation in rainfall on coexisting songbirds in a tropical rainforest. These costs may be strongly expressed in tropical rainforests where rain is prevalent, thermal tolerances are narrow, and temperatures are often below thermoneutral levels. Yet, studies of the effects of rainfall and wetting on energetics, behavior and demography across diverse tropical species are lacking. The proposed work will use novel experimental and observational approaches to advance understanding of how nest structure affects energy use of parents due to heat loss under wet versus dry conditions. The proposed work will also elucidate how rain, temperature, nest structure, and parental behavior combine to affect energy expenditure of offspring and how energy is allocated to differing body components during growth. Finally, it will reveal demographic ramifications of the physiological costs of rain and nest structure to gain new insight into fitness consequences. Ultimately, this work will provide a new understanding of the influences of climate and nest structure upon heat balance and evolution of parental and growth strategies among diverse species. This work will also identify relative demographic sensitivities of species as a function of their nest types, ecologies and behaviors to aid prioritization schemes for conservation. A large number of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doctoral scholar, will receive training in diverse field methodologies and scientific principles."

The immune signaling network controls the immune response. This research is aimed at answering two questions. (1) How did the sophisticated immune signaling network in contemporary land plants arise during their evolution? (2) How much diversity in the signaling network exists among different flowering plants?  Question (2) will be answered by comparing in detail how the signaling network operates in three diverse flowering plant species, tomato, rice, and the model plant Arabidopsis. The results of the research will provide an example of how sophisticated biological systems can evolve. They will also provide ideas about how the plant immune signaling network can be engineered to improve disease resistance in crops. As outreach, a mobile conservatory will be developed and used to teach 3rd grade students about how plants adapt to their environments.<br/><br/>The immune signaling network in the model plant Arabidopsis is highly resilient against pathogen attack on its components. This research will investigate when during the evolution of land plants such a highly resilient signaling network was acquired. This will be achieved by interrogating when specific immune-related subfamilies neofunctionalized within larger protein families using phylogenetic analysis of protein families of diverse land plant species. The subfamily analysis method will be automated and applied at the genome scale to investigate the times at which the networks controlling various other biological processes evolved. Key network components are generally conserved among angiosperms. However, it has never been investigated whether the state of a network (the set of network parameters) is also conserved. The immune signaling network state will be compared among three diverse angiosperm species, Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice. It will be achieved by combinatorially perturbing key network hubs using mutations, measuring the effects of the perturbations on the immune response using transcriptome analysis and other methods, and comparing the relationships among the key network hubs among the three species. This research will provide insights into how a highly resilient biological network has evolved and reveal the extent to which the structure and state of the immune signaling network have diverged among angiosperms.

Soil erosion has significant implications that include sediment accumulation in rivers and dams; disruption of wetland, lake, and floodplain ecosystems; and contamination.  Southern New England is a dynamic landscape that preserves a dramatic transformation of widespread deforestation and agriculture followed by reforestation spanning the period from the early 17th century to the present.  The investigator will use high-resolution topographic data derived from light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurement, soil trenches, sediment cores, and geochemistry to explore the links between human impacts on upland soils and downstream watershed sedimentation.  He will quantify the spatial arrangement of historic land use; quantify local soil impacts from land-use practices; and evaluate archives of sedimentation characteristics associated with different historic land-use practices.  The data collected in each area will facilitate a more holistic examination of the link between the style and duration of specific land use practices and the legacy of human impacts throughout a landscape.

The root system of a plant is typically composed of a main root with multiple branches and the branching pattern has substantive impacts on the plant's performance. This project focuses on discovering the mechanisms that determine where along the main root the branch roots will be placed. The PI recently discovered that the pattern of root branching varies as plants progress through different stages of their life cycle. Coincident with an early change in the pattern of root branching, the arrangement of leaves in the shoot also changes, raising many questions about how the positioning of leaves and roots is controlled and coordinated. The results of this work will enhance the United States' position as a leader in scientific research by adding to the understanding of fundamental principles that guide plant growth and may contribute to the ability to breed plants with higher yields or enhanced acquisition or use of water or nutrients such as nitrogen. The project also will contribute to training the next generation in science and technology by directly involving undergraduate students in the research, a practice that has been shown to be effective in recruiting and retaining students in science.  The project will also support laboratory research experiences for area high school students, who will be mentored by the PI and undergraduates, further extending the project's educational and scientific impact.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph: <br/>Distinct phases of development have long been recognized in plant shoots. In contrast, the potential for phase-dependent changes in root development receives little attention, although changes in meristem size and root thickness are known to occur. New data from the PI's laboratory show that the positioning of lateral roots varies as the root matures, and that proteins that direct auxin transport affect these stages differently. In addition, loss-of-function of several genes that affect lateral root positioning also affect the time at which plants switch from a juvenile to a mature pattern of leaf arrangement. This project will: (1) establish the timing of developmental changes that take place in the root and test the hypothesis that genes known to control phase change in the shoot also control phase in the root. It will also (2) investigate genetic and molecular interactions between the identified genes and test hypotheses as to how regulation of organ spacing in the root and shoot are coordinated. This project will increase the opportunities for undergraduates to actively participate in science through the PI's laboratory, through a credit-bearing course that will be revised to make involvement in this research the centerpiece of the educational experience, and through opportunities for travel to a leading plant developmental biology laboratory outside of Oberlin. The PI and undergraduates will also partner with the local public high school, bringing multi-day investigative experiments to the high school and creating opportunities for motivated high school students from underrepresented groups to work in the PI's laboratory."

Planarian flatworms can impressively regenerate a new head and brain, yet the signals that control their adult stem cells, causing them to divide and produce these new tissues, are not known. This project seeks to understand the molecular identity and function of these signals - particularly, how new tissues determine when their regeneration is complete, and how the individual identity of the regenerated cells that rebuild neural circuits is established. These goals will be pursued in flatworms using a combination of sophisticated genetic, molecular, cell-biological, microscopy and imaging techniques.

Sustainable development of unconventional oil and gas production relies on efficient use of water resources and safe disposal of effluent from hydraulic fracturing processes. A key to attaining these goals lies in the effective removal of a subset of contaminants amid high levels of background electrolytes in alternative (brackish) water sources and in the waste water produced during unconventional oil and gas production operations.<br/><br/>Species of key interest in this project include barium (II) and strontium (II), which give rise to scaling problems and interfere with the proper function of gelling agents. The project will involve close collaboration among two university PIs from Chemistry and Environmental Engineering at Texas Tech and an industrial co-PI with extensive experience in water management for a major oil and gas production company, this proposal will explore conjugating commercial electrodialysis membranes with optimized supported crown ether moieties to enable selective binding and transport of target contaminants in electrodialysis processes. The objective of this project is to develop a class of electrodialysis membranes with novel ion-gating functionality for selective removal of problematic ions in alternative brackish water sources for energy production uses. The central hypothesis of this research is that intrinsic ion selectivity of electrodialysis processes can be significantly improved by incorporating a thin layer of ion sequestrants of suitable structure and density at the surface of electrodialysis membranes, creating localized concentration gradients driving highly selective transport of the target ions. The PIs ability to prepare crown ethers of diverse conformations and to adapt their molecular structure for optimal metal binding specificity renders the proposed technology a versatile method for selective ion separation. One attractive application is to enable the use of alternative water sources for hydraulic fracturing operations. In this one-year project, the project will focus on the removal of two ions of primary concerns to unconventional oil and gas production, namely, Ba2+ and Sr2+, although the concept can in principle be extended to other problematic ions, such as Ra2+, which is the major source of radio-activity in naturally occurring radioactive material and its disposal is subject to stringent regulatory control. The research being addressed in the project will potentially reduce the environmental impacts of unconventional oil and gas production and enhance water sustainability at the energy-water nexus, particularly in regions where the fast-growing practice of hydraulic fracturing has imposed a considerable stress on the local fresh water resources. This project will provide excellent academic training and industry exposure opportunity for undergraduate students and two graduate students from Environmental Engineering and Chemistry through participation in a multidisciplinary team involving strong industry-university collaboration. The industrial partner will advise the research team on practical constraints and potential complications associated with alternative water treatment technologies, so that the PIs will formulate research strategies to address the unique water treatment needs of the energy industry, which are substantially different from water treatment for domestic use. The PIs will expand their current outreach programs to engage K-12 and community college students from under-represented groups in STEM curricula and research. Research data will be reported in public domain including conferences, industrial seminars, and peer-reviewed journals."

Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes."

Monitoring the personal dietary environment and determination of environmental patterns related to dietary intake can empower both health care providers and patients to optimize evidence-based decisions. This information can help individuals recognize less healthful behaviors that may be occurring in their lives. Health professionals will also have better information to advise behavioral strategies within the context of the patient's environment. The results may also be used to help guide the development of programs to reduce the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases in the US population and advise US dietary policy.<br/><br/>This highly interdisciplinary investigation explores image processing and computer vision techniques to extract and quantify dietary environmental factors and study their connections with dietary intake.

Violent conflict between Sunni and Shia sects can be found in a number of countries throughout the Middle East. While a large volume of qualitative literature address such this topic, we lack rigorous quantitative studies into the factors that lead to such violence, along with factors that serve to escalate or mitigate sectarian tensions in the region.  Relatedly, scholars know little about the effects of heightened Sunni-Shia hostility on citizens' political attitudes and behaviors in the affected regions. Drawing on research in political science and social psychology, the PI will conduct an empirical examination of the causes and consequences of sectarian animosity in the Arab World, paying particular attention to those factors that may lead to reductions in the levels of violence.  To gain a deeper understanding of the causes of sectarian conflict, the investigator utilizes a unique data set comprised of Twitter and Google Trends data, real-time event data, public opinion polls, as well as results from a lab experiment.  Substantively, this project will offer empirical insights into the dynamics of a precarious source of conflict and violent extremism, with key ramifications both for regional stability and global security.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>To examine the causes of sectarian tensions, the PI will use Twitter and event data to explore how exogenous violent events lead to the escalation in sectarian hostility, and the role political and religious elites play in this process. The PI proposes to administer a series of household survey, timed to coincide with Shia religious holidays to assess the causal effect of elevated sectarian tensions on attitudes toward democracy, authoritarianism, and extremism.  Additionally, the PI will utilize an experimental design to test the degree to which emphasizing common threats and experiences of victimization might serve to reduce outgroup prejudice among Sunni and Shia Muslims in two ways.  First, by conducting the experiment on a sample comprised of students, and secondly, through the use of a Twitter experiment. By adopting innovative methodological approaches that build upon and help reconcile existing theories of intergroup relations, this project makes important contributions to both political science and social psychology.  Furthermore, by helping to identify causes and consequence of sectarian hostility, and by providing empirically validated approaches to combat such tensions, this work is poised to provide valuable insights to policy makers and academics alike."

This API will allow Weld to perform complex optimizations like loop blocking across parallel libraries, unlocking speedups not yet possible.<br/><br/>Success of this project will result in the creation of software that automatically maps existing key data intensive applications (e.g., data analytics, machine learning and search) to emerging hardware devices and achieves a 10-100x speedup over current applications. Beyond producing new technology, this project will train the next generation of engineers in high performance processing, online teaching resources, and research mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students. Together, education and new technology may make industrial, scientific, and government users of big data 10-100x more productive and enable the next generation of knowledge-driven systems."

This project will compare two tilapia species to decipher the biological mechanisms used by fish (and animals in general) for coping with environmental stress and change. Environmental change represents a global concern and can occur over a range of time scales (daily, annual, decadal etc.) and spatial scales (local, regional, etc.). This project develops and applies novel molecular biology approaches for revealing the mechanisms used by stress-tolerant tilapia, but lacking in stress-sensitive tilapia, for coping with environmental (in particular, salinity) change. This is especially important because tilapia are the most rapidly growing aquaculture commodity world-wide and knowledge about which species to select for increased food production in the developing world is critical. These studies also inform us about the evolutionary time scales needed for these fish, as well as other animals, to adapt to environmental changes. In addition, the project facilitates assessment of the potential for invasiveness if tilapia are cultured in non-native habitats. This project advances education by training of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from minorities that are underrepresented in the sciences. It also provides outreach to K-12 students and educators, aquaculture producers, and conservation organizations. It includes international collaborations and student exchange in Africa and Israel. In addition, this project will generate and make available molecular biology tools and approaches that can be used by researchers in many other areas of biology.<br/><br/>This project tests the overall hypothesis that euryhaline tilapia differ from their stenohaline congeners by salinity-induced regulation of specific mRNAs and proteins that are necessary for high osmotolerance/ salinity tolerance. The focus will be on previously identified osmoregulatory proteins, myo-inositol phosphate synthase (MIPS), inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMAP1), and the Na-K ATPase alpha 3 subunit (NKA3a), to reveal causality between the regulation of these genes and salinity tolerance. Objective 1 is to determine mRNAs and proteins that are altered by salinity in euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) compared to a congeneric stenohaline species, O. niloticus. This objective includes comparison of salinity effects on mRNA and protein abundances and identification of relevant single amino acid variants (SAVs) and post-translational modifications. Objective 2 is to reveal inducible cis-elements in euryhaline tilapia using a combination of experimental (enhancer trapping) and bioinformatics (motif searching) approaches. Objective 3 is to purify the transcription factor that activates the tilapia osmotically/salinity responsive enhancer in IMPA1 and MIPS genes by affinity-based, functional complementation, and mass spectrometry approaches. Objective 4 comprises genome editing in tilapia cells to determine whether MIPS and IMPA1 genes, and the NKA3a SAV A428?¨S are necessary for maintaining high cellular osmotolerance. Effects on cellular phenotype will be assessed by cell morphology/ proliferation assays, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Objective 5 is to perform genome editing of a target informed by Objective 4 in whole tilapia. Effects on tilapia salinity tolerance, morphology, behavior, physiology and molecular phenotypes (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome) will be analyzed."

This research project tests a new idea, that learning also importantly involves molecular changes in other parts of nerve cells which control the production of electrical activity required for these cells to communicate with each other. Learning is studied in the context of how young songbirds learn to sing, which happens in a similar way to how humans learn to speak, play a musical instrument, or produce any complicated sequence of behavior. Using a combination of behavioral observation and recording together with anatomical, physiological, molecular, computational and statistical techniques, the research team will test the hypothesis that developmental singing changes are accompanied by changes in cell electrical activity that are not located at synapses. They will also identify the mechanistic basis for these electrical changes. This research will reveal important new details about how the brain can store learned information for an entire lifetime. It will also provide student research assistants with broad multidisciplinary training, as well as developing new analytical software and computational models that will benefit the broader neuroscience community (these will be made freely available through a publically-accessible web site). Neuroscience and mathematics videos tagged to specific State-mandated high school learning objectives will also be produced, which will be made available to teachers via a cataloged State portal. Finally, the research team conducts a wide variety of community education programs specifically related to neuroscience, birdsong, and learning.  These activities include programs for K-12 schools as well as a scholarly course for senior citizens.<br/><br/>Much is known about the brain areas and circuits that underlie birdsong learning. Consequently, scientists know where to look for learning-induced changes (an area named HVC), but they do not know what neural changes encode the auditory memories of song. The proposed research tests the novel hypothesis that changes in specific, non-synaptic ionic currents in HVC neurons contribute to the encoding of auditory memories. Songbird auditory learning can be readily manipulated by controlling exposure to a tutor song. Preliminary data show that the intrinsic cell body/axonal channel properties of HVC neurons change in an experience-dependent manner during song development. The research team's recent characterization and modeling of the ionic currents that determine the physiology of HVC neurons in the adult finch now allow for the proposed developmental studies. Proposed studies will test hypotheses about the developmental emergence of specific ionic currents as they relate to sensory learning. This will lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this learning. As part of this project, the team will also correct mistaken views about HVC of female zebra finches. Long thought to lack male-typical connectivity, new data show that female and male HVC have the same cell types and patterns of extrinsic connectivity. Since females show auditory learning of tutor song, but do not sing, analysis of female HVC will provide a critical test of the proposed hypotheses. Together, the proposed experiments will provide clues to fundamental questions about how early sensory information is stored as a stable memory trace that lasts a lifetime."

This has been a central question in economics for nearly a century, and its answer has implications for the long term well-being of societies, and for how government policy can promote this well-being.  In this project we will study the most common firm type in the world:  the family-owned farm.  Our research focuses on farms in Africa, which employ a large share of the world?s poor.  A detailed understanding the productivity of these firms -- whether and why some firms are more productive than others ? will help provide the foundation for designing policy interventions that could improve their overall productivity, and thus lift incomes for many of the world's poorest.   Working with US satellite companies, we will also generate new estimates of agricultural productivity based on satellite imagery, and make these data available to both researchers and policymakers.  Results from this research has policy implications for increasing the productivity of small businesses and thus reduce poverty throughout the world, including in the U.S. <br/><br/>The goal of our proposed work is to characterize the size and sources of productivity dispersion across family owned farms, the most common firm type in the world and the employer of a majority of the world's poor.  Productivity dispersion has been well studied among firms in the developed world, but surprisingly little is known about the temporal and spatial patterns of productivity dispersion in poor countries.  Understanding the size and source of productivity gaps among agricultural firms -- previously difficult to study due to lack of data -- would fill a large gap in the existing productivity literature.  <br/><br/>We propose to make progress on this question by combining two newly-available sources of data:  a growing set of high-quality household panel surveys currently underway by the World Bank in multiple African countries, and brand-new high-resolution satellite-based estimates of land productivity in Eastern Africa.  These two data sources, in combination, will allow us to evaluate for agricultural firms the stylized facts that have been established for manufacturing and retail firms:  whether productivity dispersion across firms is large and persistent, whether firm entry and exit are correlated with productivity, and whether selective exit and entry are an important source of aggregate productivity growth within the agricultural sector.  Analysis will be conducted across nine African countries."

The ability of plant viruses to cause these diseases is often linked to their ability to move systemically throughout their hosts.  Systemic movement generally requires the virus to gain access to the plant's vascular phloem.  As the plant's main transport tissue, phloem functions in the systemic movement of a diverse set of molecules.  The movement of these molecules has a vital role in mediating plant metabolism, development and pathogen defenses, including age related resistance.  Thus, to be successful viruses must overcome these defenses in order to usurp this transport tissue.  Unfortunately, mechanisms controlling this form of resistance are not well studied.  Efforts in this project will investigate the regulation and role of ARR in preventing virus systemic movement through the vascular phloem using a model virus - plant pathosystem.  Additional studies will determine the mechanisms viruses use to overcome this resistance and achieve systemic spread throughout the plant.  Since age-related resistance impacts a wide range of pathogen-host systems, it is anticipated that this study will have broad implications to many agriculturally important crops.  Additional broader impacts will involve the integration of virology and plant biology disciplines for the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students with the goal of introducing these students to the diverse career opportunities available in these fields.      <br/><br/>Technical Paragraph<br/><br/>Using a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) - Arabidopsis system, efforts in this proposal will exploit the ability of TMV to reprogram phloem specific transcription through an interaction with the companion cell (CC) expressed auxin indole acetic acid transcription regulator IAA26. IAA proteins are components of the plant auxin response system and play essential roles in many aspects of plant development, metabolism and defense.  The ability of TMV to successfully disrupt IAA26 function significantly enhances virus systemic movement in older plant tissues. Phloem specific transcriptional studies demonstrate a role for IAA26 in the regulation of salicylic and jasmonic acid defense responses that are associated with age related resistance (ARR). Thus, TMV reprograming of IAA26 directed gene regulation likely functions in the suppression of ARR. The identification of this interaction represents a novel system from which to investigate molecular mechanisms involved in virus phloem loading. Efforts in this proposal will focus on identifying the CC expressed ARF transcription factors modulated by IAA26, identify CC genes under the control of IAA26 regulation and characterize the impact of IAA26 regulated CC genes on virus phloem loading.  Combined these studies will have broad impacts on our understanding of phloem-mediated virus movement that could result in new strategies to control these agriculturally important pathogens.  Additional broader impacts will introduce high school and undergraduate students to the diverse research opportunities available in the fields of plant biology, virology and biotechnology with the goal of encouraging these students to consider advanced training in these areas."

As countries 'graduate' from these to higher categories, the shift is viewed positively by the international community and, in turn, often results in receiving additional social and material advantages. Faced with this tradeoff, some countries attempt to remain within the developing categories, while others strive to be categorized as developed. The PI explains why economic elites, like donors and investors, are so influenced by these classifications and, in turn, why countries pursue strategies designed to change their classifications. The project illustrates how countries balance their material interests with their desire for improved international status and traces how such status hierarchies emerge. To study this phenomenon, the PI draws on cross-national data, a lab experiment administered to economic experts, and interviews with government bureaucrats in multiple countries. The project highlights how institutions like the World Bank and United Nations -- whether intentionally or unintentionally -- affect the opportunities and strategies available to developing countries. The findings provide useful insight about how bureaucratic decision making might help create or maintain a country's development classification, which, in turn, influence economic elites who refer to these systems when making policy decisions. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Despite the assumed importance of economic development status in the international relations literature, scholars have relatively scant understanding of the conditions under which such status might motivate state behavior. In particular, such status might affect the types of strategies countries adopt to obtain a particular status. The PI speaks to both questions by studying the status politics of developing countries.  The research focuses on how specific states are classified by international organizations. The first part of the project explains why such classifications significantly affect the way elite economic actors perceive and interact with these countries. The PI tests an original cognitive-strategic theory using cross-national data that utilizes the arbitrary thresholds and shocks to data as sources of identification. The PI also administers a lab experiment conducted on an elite sample to investigate the question. The second part of the project investigates the strategic responses of countries either to seek or to avoid certain classifications of economic development status. The PI uses cross-national data analysis and interviews with government bureaucrats in multiple countries to assess how states balance their desire for economic development status with material interests."

Much of the non-wastewater organic material used in co-digestion is food waste, typically from food industry operations, commercial food waste and post-consumer food waste from institutions or residential sources. The biogas (methane) produced can be used to generate heat, power, and/or electricity. This workshop will provide a significant scientific basis for the development of best practices to ensure the benefits of appropriately designed and implemented renewable energy recovery through co-digestion with minimization of side-effects that can curtail this process as currently practiced. This workshop will also address a Federal goal to promote biogas utilization and expand the biogas industry through renewable feed-stocks such as wastewater solids and food waste.  <br/><br/>It is estimated that 100 water resource recovery facilities located in the United States currently import organic waste for co-digestion with wastewater solids. As co-digestion is implemented, some municipalities collect empirical data on anaerobic digester performance and operations. The co-digestion of food waste with wastewater residuals using the built infrastructure at water resource recovery facilities, diverts organic wastes from landfills and recovers the energy in food waste in a sustainable manner at a competitive energy cost. However, there are far less data available to predict digester performance with the addition of food wastes than for wastewater solids alone. Understanding the relationships between the science and operational practice is essential to make co-digestion an efficient process to be implemented by utilities so to become a viable option for food waste disposal and promote renewable energy recovery. There is potential to improve the process and practice of anaerobic digestion through science. This workshop will provide a technical, economic and practical framework for co-digestion, and identify current and future research gaps, processes enhancements and control points. The Water Environment Research Foundation (WERF) proposes to hold a workshop to integrate research findings and advance science on anaerobic digestion and co-digestion with the needs of WRRF AD practitioners. WERF is well positioned to convene this workshop and disseminate the results. With more than 270 members representing much of the sewered population, and 8 years of research on co-digestion, WERF has become the industry leader."

Adult crayfish are used for this research because the cell populations that produce new neurons are much easier to study and manipulate than in other animals commonly used for this type of research. Unlike neural stem cells in other animals such as mice, the population of cells that directly produces new neurons in adult brains do not self-renew; rather, this population appears to be replenished by cells coming from some other source in the body. Previous data indicate that the immune system provides these precursor cells to the adult crayfish brain. The goal of this proposal is to build on this previous research to definitively identify how the immune system contributes to the generation of adult-born neurons. The experiments are designed to test three hypotheses. The first aim examines the hypothesis that circulating blood/immune cells (hemocytes) interact with specific physical locations in the crayfish brain (neurogenic niches), that cause these cells to remain and produce descendants that differentiate into neurons. The second aim examines the hypothesis that hemocytes are chemically attracted to the neurogenic niches by specific molecules. The third aim examines the hypothesis that the nervous system regulates the production of the neural precursors by the immune system via the release of a chemical (serotonin) that biochemically modulates the fate of immune system cells. By clearly identifying these cellular and molecular influences, these studies will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how stem cells enable the production of new neurons in adult brains. This work also contributes to society through training undergraduates in stem cell research, and educating the general public about the value of non-mammalian biological research and the potential for life-long plasticity in the nervous system.<br/><br/>In this project, GFP-positive (GFP+) hemocytes originating in transgenic crayfish will be adoptively transferred to recipient non-transgenic animals, and their target organs and differentiated properties will be determined. In addition, GFP+ cells extracted from different regions of the immune system in transgenic crayfish will be used in adoptive transfers to define the tissue origins of cells that are competent to produce adult-born neurons. These studies will also identify local guidance cues that attract hemocytes to the neurogenic niche using in vitro cell migration assays, as well as in situ nucleic acid hybridization and immunocytochemistry to locate candidate molecules that have been identified by transcriptome analyses. Finally, the coordinated regulation of the innate immune system and adult neurogenesis by a 5-HT-activated cytokine (astakine 1; AST1) pathway will be tested. Differential expression and localization of AST1 in niche, brain and immune tissues will be assessed after altering 5-HT levels. By testing the hypothesis that cells originating in the innate immune system produce adult-born neurons, these studies challenge the canonical view that the ectodermal origins of embryonic neural tissues are the sole source of neurons in the adult brain."

Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary field of study that explores the design and implementation of embedded, networked computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With these modes of interaction, the user's focus can remain primarily on the world surrounding the device.

We will explore user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will have less to do with the driver?s attention to the road (as is the case in today?s vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed, quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles. In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces that keep the human operator?s attention on the relevant interfaces and on the outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator?s visual focus, and how to guide the operator?s shift of attention towards these entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction, task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved designs of interactions with large displays."

If politicians are responsive to constituent opinions, one would expect to observe similar outcomes across different leaders.  In reality, though, public policy outcomes tend to vary systematically depending on who serves in elected office. This dissertation examines representation in American cities. New data reveal that American mayors, like politicians at higher levels of government, tend not to be highly representative of their constituents.  For instance, they are more likely to be white males with prior political experience and white-collar careers. Business owners and executives are especially well represented. By providing compelling evidence that mayors can and do shape public policy, this research contributes to our understanding of the nature and importance of local politics. In addition, the study also begins to explore the causes and consequences of the overrepresentation of business owners and executives. The findings suggest that the nonpartisan election system used in a large share of local mayoral elections may create an interesting interaction with the preferences of voters that affects the electoral prospects of underrepresented groups. Moreover, this research implies that more equitable representation may result in policy changes that could benefit less affluent citizens. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>While elected executives typically have limited formal authority, they are unquestionably important actors in the policymaking process. Investigating the influence of executives, however, presents several methodological challenges. In an effort to overcome some of these obstacles, this study focuses on mayors in American cities. Although city halls may lack the prestige of the White House or the state house, mayors oversee the provision of essential public services that Americans rely on every day. This project addresses three fundamental questions about mayors and local politics: 1) Who serves as mayor? 2) How do voters select mayors?  And, 3) does it matter who voters choose to serve as mayor? A new dataset comprised of information about mayoral candidates provides unprecedented details about American mayors and descriptive representation in U.S. cities. The study incorporates both observational and experimental methods to advance causal arguments about how voters select mayors and how mayors influence policy. The results of a conjoint survey experiment suggest that a considerable deficit of descriptive representation does not necessarily reflect voters' reluctance to choose women or minority candidates.  Rather these attributes may be more influential in the absence of party labels, common to numerous cities that select officials in non-partisan elections. Of particular importance is the fact that the individuals who lead have significant influence over policy outcomes. An analysis of the effect of electing a business executive mayor finds that mayors can and do shape fiscal policy outcomes with implications for how the costs and benefits of local government are distributed."

Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers. Good correlation between the graphene sensor and a legal grade breathalyzer in large-scale human tests will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed sensors, which can then be shipped to early adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales."

The SB3C meetings, and their predecessor SBC meetings, are generally considered the premiere annual meetings for biomechanics. The primary purpose of the meeting is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and international scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanics, biotechnology, biotransport, biomaterials, tissue engineering, rehabilitation and design. The organizing committee for SB3C2016 is drawn from individuals in academia and the industry with significant experience in running the previous summer meetings. The meeting and its precursor meetings have traditionally provided a high-quality, multidisciplinary biomedical engineering event since the early 90's and contributed to training many generations of academics and researchers. Notably, the summer meetings series has, since its inception, prioritized the integration of students into the meeting to support their professional development and future connection to the biomechanics, biotransport and bioengineering research community. For many years, students have made up more than 50% of attendees and presenters. The theme of this year's meeting is ""Growth, Development, Remodeling, and Repair"". In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it serves an important cross-fertilization role, since attendees are drawn from a very broad range of disciplines beyond the biomechanics community. <br/><br/>The aims of the project are to sponsor travel fellowships for females and under-represented minorities; and, to sponsor the prestigious Student Paper Competition by covering the meeting registration costs of the top 40 BS and MS competition submissions. Finalists and winners in the student paper competition can add this information to their resumes, and the competition provides an opportunity for students to develop as researchers and is a significant career boost, enhancing retention of the most talented students and providing role models for all student attendees. Through the technical proceedings and conference web site, information presented at the meeting will be available to multiple societies and to the public at large. Further, the conference has historically had, and is expected to continue to have more than 50 percent of the attendees being students and postdoctoral fellows and more than 25 percent female attendees. For the second time, the organization committee has been extended to include a Diversity Chair. Through the travel fellowships and associated workshops, the PI plans to establish this meeting as the ""go to"" conference for female and under-represented minority attendees."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called ""Faces and Voices of Science"" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds. The videos will be made available online for teachers and professors to incorporate in lectures.<br/><br/><br/>Visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently.  One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

However, the treatments that work for mice having a condition almost never work in other animals with that condition. This apparently occurs because, even when gene pathways seem similar across species, their regulation, or network wiring, is different. Some of these changes may be caused by retrotransposon elements, whose presence has been shown to be correlated with changes in the cohesin-associated regulatory modules of human and mouse cells. Modifying sequencing technologies with special reagents has allowed us to start mapping regulatory regions in both human and mouse; results show that there is a high rate of change at regulatory sites, with only about half of the sites showing conserved sequence between human and mouse cell lines and, even where conservation is found, the expected transcription factors don't bind under similar conditions. A further complication is that most gene networks are regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs) that must bind in a particular order and combination; often this binding is at sites quite distant from the genes. Looping of the DNA at distant sites back around to bring it close, and 'locking' it in place with a regulatory protein, is one of the factors this research aims to dissect. Understanding what these regulatory element TF combinations are, what mechanisms lead to change, and how their regulatory actions can be modulated will have important applications in such areas as the treatment of disease, including better targeted therapies. This research requires strong computational skills as well as understanding the biological states of cells and the technical details of the assays; in addition to mentoring the graduate students who will take leading roles in carrying out the research, high school students will be recruited to participate in computational summer boot camps and undergraduates will be recruited to paid summer internships for immersion in the research methods and questions, with a strong emphasis on bringing more women and under-served minorities into active research experiences.   <br/><br/>In this project the PI will use recently developed methods to explore the co-binding of transcription factors with CTCF and the cohesin complex in matched human and mouse cells. These sites represent anchor regions for 3D interactions in the genome. Initial work suggests that there is extensive turnover of these sites beyond the already high turnover of cis-regulatory modules in the two genomes. This finding stands in sharp contrast to previously published work showing, at low resolution, there is a high level of conservation of the physical 3D structure between the two species. The PI has previously developed computational methods demonstrating a complex co-localization of transcription factors and shown that these patterns are conserved in mouse. These patterns were shown to maintain similar regulatory properties even with underlying sequence divergence. Here the PI will explore these conserved patterns in terms of conservation at cohesin sites in the two species. As an extension of this, the project will focus on the effect of retrotransposons in the expansion of cohesin sites in the two lineages. Finally, the project will integrate 3D structural information from ChIA-PET and HiC data to determine the effects of the gains and losses of cohesin sites on the conservation of specific loops and topological domains. This work extends from a new way of considering conservation, that of conservation of regulatory patterns instead of considering only sequence context. Because of this, the PI is able to study the entire mouse and human genomes in comparison instead of only the small fraction of the genomes comparable by sequence. As a result, the project will provide new insights into the regulatory structure of the two genomes and shed light on the aspects of gene regulatory control through looping and domain structure that would previously have been impossible to consider.

Topology and geometry are central areas of mathematics that have been the focus of active research for centuries. Topology concerns the mathematical properties of spaces ranging from the physical, like the surface of a doughnut, to the abstract, like the space of configurations of robots in a factory or the space of functions that satisfy a differential equation. Geometry concerns abstract or concrete notions distance or length, such as the amount of energy to move between two configurations of robots. Topology and geometry enjoy particularly rich interactions in low dimensions, and these connections have been a source of profound discoveries in both fields. The main objective of the conference is to bring together leading experts who have made substantial contributions in low-dimensional topology and geometry and to provide a platform to present recent results and propose future directions of research. The conference is organized in conjunction with the 32nd Shanks Lecture, which will be delivered by Professor Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley). This award provides opportunities for mathematicians from underrepresented groups and researchers that are early in their career or lack other sources of travel support to attend and participate in the conference.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on important developments in low-dimensional topology and geometry, with emphasis on the powerful negative curvature and combinatorial techniques that have driven many recent advances. Topics will include, but are not limited to, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, mapping class groups, the geometry and topology of curves on surfaces, surface bundles, Gromov-hyperbolic simplicial complexes, and CAT(0) cube complexes. The activities will include nineteen keynote talks and the Shanks lecture, with ample time for questions and discussion. The combination of topics and speakers will attract numerous participants and will afford students and recent PhDs an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from leaders in these fields.

Biological functions are carried out through the myriad interactions of biological molecules, such as when proteins bind to other proteins to modulate their activity or to nucleic acids to regulate genes. DNA sequencing has led to an explosive growth in data reporting genomic sequences and their variations, and gene expression through transcript profiling; the data streams from high-throughput technologies for protein and metabolite profiling are quickly catching up. This has led to ever-expanding repositories that archive, organize and share the resulting data: by also connecting experimental conditions to the molecular profiles, researchers come to understand which molecular interactions occur and, from these, deduce many of the biological functions in living cells. Extraction of meaningful biological insights from these data sets is challenging in two ways: the data sets are very large so they require computational methods for basic handling, and each type of data differs from the others in many ways (type of noise, source of error, completeness, etc.) so they may require different statistical modeling to standardize them correctly prior to merging them. Carried out correctly, the resulting high-dimensional data sets are suitable for a variety of predictive analytics that reveal functional modules in the molecular interactomes. Results from this project will be made available through webservers and open source software. The integrated research and educational activities include interdisciplinary bioinformatics curriculum development, outreach to high school students and research opportunities for students in underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Comprehensively understanding various functional aspects of a gene or a protein, such as involvement in a particular biological process, physical/genetic interactions, or disease association, is critical for both biology and translational medicine research. Since exhaustively characterizing genes or proteins through biological experiments is often intractable, systems-level integration of knowledge and computational hypothesis generation have garnered great interest in the field as an effective way to guide experiments. In this project, we will develop a novel computational framework for data integration and dimensionality reduction of heterogeneous network and functional genomic data to obtain informative data representations in a low-dimensional vector space. To utilize both molecular networks and evolutionary information, we will apply the proposed dimensionality reduction techniques to effectively integrate sequence data and network data across multiple species for predicting gene function.  Our approaches will enable large-scale, integrated, cross-species, genome-scale gene function annotation. Through this integration, our methods can also infer functional homology or analogy between genes, which share weak sequence similarity but relevant biological functions, from different species.

Findings from this research will be presented in various formats to participant communities, local development NGOs, elementary school children and graduate students to promote greater awareness of how social networks and mobile technologies affect each other, how these effects vary for different individuals and groups, and how vulnerability is contextual. The project will also support interdisciplinary graduate education in the U.S. and improve international social science data infrastructure. This award is made under the SBE-RCUK Lead Agency Agreement.<br/><br/>This project is embedded in a larger research context concerned with the rapid spread of mobile information and communication technologies (ICTs). Mobile phones especially have been heralded as transformative new tools to reduce global poverty. Scholars and development professionals alike have pointed out that phones can greatly reduce barriers to information, promote market efficiency, boost savings and expedite emergency response. An alternative perspective is that phones can magnify situations rather than transform them. In some contexts, phones have not been shown to improve communication, leading scholars to ask which lives may be transformed and which may not? Valuable tools may be less valuable to people who are not well positioned in society like minorities, women, or the poor. These concerns are especially prevalent in developing countries where poverty is common and social positioning is hierarchical with gender, age, and wealth serving as important drivers of access, influence and power. Furthermore, in rural areas telecommunications infrastructure can be patchy, access to resources like health care can be stochastic, and environmental shocks like droughts can be devastating. To address how phones may transform some lives and simply reproduce others, this project will use mixed qualitative and quantitative methodologies to examine how phones affect women's and men's social networks, access to information and decision making, and capacities to respond to shocks within several pastoralist Maasai communities in northern Tanzania over a three-year period. Key hypotheses include: (1) men's and women's social networks will be affected differently by mobile phones; and (2) women's access to household decision making will significantly affect tradeoffs between individual and household vulnerabilities."

Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary field of study that explores the design and implementation of such embedded, networked computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With these modes of interaction, the user?s focus can remain primarily on the world surrounding the device. Human-computer interaction is a central issue in ubicomp, and it will be the focus of the work of the IRES students who will conduct research at two locations in Germany: at the University of Stuttgart, and at the University of Oldenburg. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Our research will explore human-computer interaction in three areas of ubicomp: in-vehicle interactions, interactions with large displays, and interactions with devices on a ship bridge. We will explore user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will have less to do with the driver's attention to the road (as is the case in today's vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed, quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles. In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces that keep the human operator's attention on the relevant interfaces and on the outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator's visual focus, and how to guide the operator's shift of attention towards these entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction, task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved designs of interactions with large displays."

Understanding how incentives interact with other motivations is a key to assuring the success of such programs. Often, a small change to the incentive structure can have a dramatic impact?positive or negative?on outcomes. In this research, the investigator examines the extent to programs involving incentives can be designed so as to increase the value of the incentive as perceived by recipients without increasing the actual cost of providing the incentive, consequently increasing the return on incentives. To the extent these program re-designs prove effective, they can be used in a variety of socially important behavior-change efforts, from improving health outcomes, to reducing pollution, to increasing productivity and savings. <br/><br/>The research builds on ?mental account theory? which posits that to decide how to spend their money, people first mentally allocate their funds between different accounts and then make spending decisions within each account.  This results in violation of the economic principle of fungibility by which money in one mental account should be a perfect substitute for money in another account. In the context of programs that use incentives to help people achieve goals, mental accounting implies that program effectiveness can be increased by targeting the incentives to a specific, highly desirable, mental account. Two sets of experiments are proposed to explore this ?targeting? hypothesis.  Some studies look at whether participation in such programs can be increased by simply relabeling or repackaging the incentive to address an expense perceived by people as particularly aversive.  A second set of studies examines whether participation can be increased by structuring the incentive provision in such a way as to trigger non-monetary considerations in the valuation process."

In some instances, homeowners may survive a hazard event yet still experience significant direct and indirect losses that, when aggregated over entire communities, can impede recovery following major disasters. Reduction of future losses may require homeowners to undertake voluntary actions to reduce risks to their residences. This research will focus on the role of social and cultural factors, including religiosity, in motivating homeowners to be proactive. This research will conduct homeowner surveys in two Haitian communities whose residential sectors were respectively devastated by 2016's Hurricane Matthew and the 2010 Earthquake. Understanding the attitudes and behaviors of these extremely vulnerable homeowners can in turn inform efforts to encourage proactive risk reduction among similar communities in the United States. Such findings will inform the development of programming enabling cultural and social institutions to move beyond their historical roles as key actors in response and recovery and become drivers of proactive risk reduction.<br/><br/>Homeowner decisions to reduce risk to natural hazards like hurricanes and earthquakes are likely constrained by complex social, economic, and political forces, including the role of important social and cultural institutions. The specific practices of these institutions may vary considerably even within those of a particular type, and may be associated with corresponding differences in the posture of adherents towards various hazards. The recent (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) and more distant history of US disasters has shown, for example, that institutional affiliation may inform risk seeking/avoidance behavior. This study pays particular attention to the role of religiosity in determining homeowner agency to rebuild for resiliency. Other variables tested for their effects on risk-reducing homeowner behavior include the severity of prior disaster damage (quantified by engineering forensic assessments), perceptions of future natural hazard risk, and time elapsed since prior disaster experience. Data used in this investigation will be generated from face-to-face homeowner surveys distributed to 500 primary decision makers of single family residences in each of the two demographically similar communities in Haiti, Les Cayes and Leogane. Residents of Les Cayes are in the early stages of recovery following 2016's Hurricane Matthew, where intent toward risk reducing construction can be documented. By contrast, respondents in Leogane, the epicenter of the 2010 Earthquake, have had six years to navigate the steps of rebuilding and demonstrate actions toward risk reduction, allowing a comparative evaluation between intent and action in household recovery. Given the lack of accurate census data for random sampling, respondents are selected through modified random walk protocols. Data analysis includes basic descriptive statistics (frequencies and cross-tabs) for the two communities and multivariate analysis on the Structural Risk Mitigation Index, a quantitative indicator of the homeowner's proactive response toward resilience-enhancing construction."

They are ubiquitous in nature and extremely diverse, yet their ecological roles are not well-defined. In this project, wild lima bean, passion vine and a defined set of fungal endophytes isolated from leaves of these plant species will be studied to understand ecological functions of endophytes as plant symbionts. In particular, the research focuses on endophyte-mediated effects on plant defenses against insect herbivores. Lima bean and passion vine are both well-established model systems and express a range of well-characterized direct and indirect defenses. This allows for disentangling of the interplay of plant-derived and endophyte-mediated effects. Beyond a better understanding of the ecological implications of plant-endophyte interactions, this research also provides novel insights for agricultural sciences, as endophytes can potentially be used to enhance plant stress tolerance to a broad variety of biotic (e.g. insect pests and pathogens) and abiotic stress factors (e.g. soil salinity, drought, high temperature, and heavy metal accumulation). The exploration of novel ways to enhance crop production, through the utilization of beneficial microbes that enhance plant stress tolerance, may help to alleviate the impending socio-economic challenges facing humanity.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in chemical analytical and molecular techniques, data analysis and scientific writing. Opportunities for K-12 school teachers and students to participate in this multidisciplinary research will be provided through lectures, lab experiences and summer field courses.<br/><br/>Fungal endophytes are exceptional biochemical engineers that produce a variety of ecologically relevant compounds. These compounds potentially affect the interaction of host plants with plant consumers and higher trophic levels. In addition to the production of fungal compounds, endophytes may alter the defensive plant chemical phenotype through up- or down-regulation of primary and secondary plant compounds. However, the functional interactions between plants, endophytes and other plant-associated organisms in natural ecosystems are virtually unknown. The aim of this research is to provide a new and functional understanding of these complex interactions by integrating laboratory and field studies to answer the following specific questions: 1) Does endophyte colonization affect herbivorous and predatory insects? 2) How does endophyte colonization alter the plant chemical phenotype? 3) Does inoculation with endophytes affect host plant performance in nature? and 4) Are endophyte-mediated traits transferable across plant species boundaries and generations? In a comparative metabolomics approach, effects of endophyte inoculations on complex compound pools are analyzed in planta. Beyond this non-targeted approach, high-throughput bioactivity profiling studies will be used to search for bioactive fungal compounds. Bioassays with natural, plant-associated arthropods will illuminate the effects of the endophyte-mediated chemical plant phenotype and its consequences for plant interactions with consumers and predators in the field. These studies are combined with tests on endophyte host-specificity as well as on quantitative plant performance under natural conditions."

The workshop participants will address a number of related questions. What roles do science and technology play in shaping, enacting and/or transforming existing constitutional orders? What implications do they have for changing our understanding of rights, responsibilities, citizenship, governance, and regulation? What can a deepened understanding of the constitutional dimensions of science and technology bring to the theory and practice of law and democratic governance in an increasingly technoscientific world? The workshop will bring together both junior and senior scholars from both sides of the Atlantic to foster transatlantic synergies and collaborations oriented to advancing research in Science and Technology Studies on the interplay of science, technology, law and governance. The conference will take place in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 2017 and will feature about 50 scholars and practitioners from STS and related disciplines. Graduate students and postdocs will be especially supported through dedicated sessions. Workshop outcomes will be made widely accessible via the web. The workshop will generate new teaching and research resources, and scholarly publications, likely in the form of a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal or an edited volume, as well widely disseminated, publicly accessible forms of writing. The workshop will also seek to foster new professional connections including those between scholars and policy practitioners.<br/><br/>The conference will draw together recent thinking about the normative dimensions of technoscience and its relation to conventional ideas of constitutional order. In doing so, it will build upon recent work across a number of domains in STS and beyond, including bio-constitutionalism, ontology and governance, infrastructure politics, and critical legal studies. Drawing on scholarship and empirical examples from multiple domains, the workshop will explore cross-cutting themes under the rubric of ""technoscientific constitutionalism."" By drawing together scholars from Germany and the US, the workshop will invite research on salient forms of cultural variation that shape how emerging forms of science and technology are integrated into, perturb, or alter social and legal order in different constitutional regimes. By bringing together scholars from STS and other disciplines from both Germany and the U.S., the workshop will foster collaboration and pave the way for future research across geographical and disciplinary boundaries. A diverse group of junior and senior scholars will have structured opportunities to work together with more senior scholars, showcase their research and develop new intellectual and professional connections.

Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved, providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds will document the project to share the overall experience of international research with a broad audience through public outreach programs. <br/><br/>Through this 3-year project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of volcano anatomy. In the Jièín Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise (Èeský ráj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100 m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation, and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as: 1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry, exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

A question of growing importance is how to translate this success to emergent problems such as precision medicine, where personalization appears to be key. The project will develop new and powerful methods, backed up by solid theory, to address increasingly urgent problems in personalization and its applications to precision medicine and policymaking. Moreover, the project will itself investigate applications to precision medicine and policymaking with an aim of developing specific guidelines that can be followed by practitioners. More generally, the research will lead to progress at the intersection of machine learning and causality, which in turn will advance our understanding of decision making from large-scale data. In precision medicine, the methods developed as part of this research will lead to improved patient outcomes through statistically efficient learning of the best way to personalize based on demographic and genetic characteristics. The research also has impact on policymaking, where personalization can be used to target educational interventions and improve the success of programs aimed at reducing recidivism, which in turn will reduce rates of incarceration and corrections spending. Implementations of the new personalization methods will be distributed as free, open-source packages for R and Python. These packages will provide a complete toolset for any doctor, sociologist, and other scientist or practitioner to develop highly effective personalization models for their application based solely on observational data. The research effort includes training and advising graduate and undergraduate students, with an emphasis on engaging with groups under represented in the field. Research results will be disseminated in public fora, including diversity-focused venues that offer an added outreach opportunity.<br/><br/>Medicine and related contexts have the property that experimentation can be prohibitively small-scale, costly, dangerous, and/or unethical, in comparison to passive data collection. Luckily, massive and ever expanding datasets are available, including hospitals' electronic medical records, with richer and richer data available from increased genotyping practices. However, such datasets are purely observational and non-experimental, where the isolated causal effect of a particular treatment is hidden by a myriad confounding factors and needs to be carefully mined out. Since, as it turns out, standard approaches to the problem based on predictive analyses fall short in this setting, this gives rise to urgently important methodological questions as to how to adapt the success of black-box machine learning to the prescriptive purpose of learning how to personalize treatments for maximal causal effect based on completely observational data. The purpose of this research project is to work toward advancing current machine learning methodology to step up to this emerging challenge by developing personalization theory, methods, and applications. Personalization is at the core of machine intelligence theory and applications. The problem of learning to personalize has been an exciting area of research over the last decade, with a strong focus on collaborative filtering and recommendation applications for web services. At the same time, among the machine learning community, there has been a tremendous growth of interest both in causal inference from observational data and in medical applications. Work on the research will result in advances in machine learning and causal inference and in stronger connections between machine learning, causal inference, personalization, and medicine."

With the recent success of mobile games, there is more public awareness of augmented reality - a real-time view of a physical, real-world environment that has elements that are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. This project brings together these concepts of augmented reality and embodied learning to develop a new innovation: mobile-phone-based augmented reality math activities. This research project investigates these activities in public elementary-schools, where students solve math related challenges, and are encouraged to find mathematics in the real objects of classrooms, gyms and playgrounds. Students carry a cell phone-based intelligent system (or a SmartWatch) that supports them as needed, giving hints and feedback as they play multiplayer team-based mathematics games that require them to measure, estimate, compute, discern and discard objects in their environments, both in their minds and using their bodies. This project advances scientific knowledge on how people learn with active physical activities, investigating the role of hand and full-body motions, as well as the role of team-based cooperation in the mathematics classrooms of our public schools.<br/><br/>This project involves a new genre of Cyberlearning Technologies called Multi-Modal Embodied Intelligent Learning and Tutoring Environments that supports learning through (1) Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which can trace students' knowledge and affect in real time, and personalize instruction through moment-by-moment tracking of students' mental states (i.e. knowledge and affective tracing); and, (2) Embodied Cognition and multi-modal interaction (physically acting on the environment in meaningful ways for more solid understanding and encoding of ideas). This project establishes a new genre of learning technologies that blends well with classroom culture, including hands-on manipulatives and educational games, while still retaining the benefits of intelligent tutoring systems, which consist of smart pedagogical decisions based on a moment-to-moment automatic assessment and understanding of the student at various levels. The project includes a series of experimental interventions that investigate the role of fine-grained gestures and gross motor actions during mathematical problem solving. Specifically, the project investigates (1) the impact of these problem-solving activities on cognitive and affective outcomes; (2) the role of personalized feedback and face-to-face social interactions; and, (3) the elements of the embodied activities that are most effective."

As a parasite it lives in association with at least one other plant, from which it derives all its water and nutritional needs, while providing nothing to its host in return. Cuscuta obtains its food from other plants, so it has no need for roots, leaves or photosynthesis, and appears as a network of yellow vining stems that wind around host plants. Cuscuta provides a fresh perspective for understanding plant science because its evolution to parasitism has resulted in exaggerated features that push the boundaries of plants capabilities. For example, Cuscuta seedlings can identify host locations and grow toward them, demonstrating an ability to detect and respond to other plants in their environment. Also, the ability of Cuscuta to feed off other plants creates a system in which to explore plant interactions at the cell level and to shape concepts of plant disease. Finally, the Cuscuta habit of exchanging RNA and proteins with hosts challenges our understanding of genetic regulation of individual organisms. This EDGE project aims to expand the use of Cuscuta as a research model system through development of plant transformation methods to genetically test gene function, and to provide techniques and tips on growing Cuscuta to other scientists. Growing the Cuscuta research community will promote progress in basic plant science with potential impacts in disease resistance, agricultural ecology and weed control.<br/><br/>The major barrier preventing the use of Cuscuta as a model plant system is the lack of a protocol for transformation and regeneration of the plant that would enable studies of gene function. The primary objective of this project is to develop transgenic Cuscuta. A few previous studies have established conditions for either Cuscuta callus transformation or regeneration from callus, but never both with the same tissue. This project focuses on systematically optimizing Cuscuta culture conditions, transformation, and regeneration to produce stably transformed parasitic plants. This will include evaluation of several Cuscuta species for amenability to transformation, along with testing Agrobacterium strains for efficiency of Cuscuta transformation. Additional approaches that aim for rapid transformation of Cuscuta without a tissue culture step (i.e., floral dip) will be tested as well. All protocols and resources will be made accessible to the broader plant community through a project website and through publications. Parties interested in obtaining germplasm used or generated in this project are encouraged to first contact USDA-APHIS regarding how to obtain permission to work with these species."

A pivotal step in the evolution of life was the transition from being unicellular to becoming multicellular.  The closest protozoan relatives of animals are aquatic ""choanoflagellates"", which are unicellular but can also form multicellular colonies.   For multicellularity to evolve, colonies of animal ancestors must have performed functions affecting their survival better than did solitary cells.  This study examines whether unicellular or multicellular choanoflagellates are better able to avoid being eaten by protozoan predators, and the mechanisms involved.  This project at the interface between biology and physics (hydrodynamics of how aquatic predators and prey interact) will give teams of undergraduate students from different majors hands-on research experience and will involve them in interdisciplinary research, which is important because many future discoveries in science and technology will be made at interfaces between different fields. Public outreach includes an interactive online site where citizen scientists can calculate the predation rates on unicellular and multicellular choanoflagellates by different types of predators. Work with women and dyslexics by the PIs will encourage success in science and technology fields. A novel microfluidic system will be developed to determine how performance and mechanisms of predator-prey interactions (usually studied in still water) are affected by realistic patterns of fluctuating shear that microscopic swimmers experience in natural, turbulent water flow.  This system will be useful for studying other aquatic microoganisms interacting with each other in nature.<br/> <br/>Protozoans, both unicellular and colonial, play important roles in aquatic food webs.  Chonaoflagellates, the closest protozoan relatives of animals, will be used to study mechanisms underlying resistance to predation by uni- vs. multicellular protozoans.  Data about choanoflagellates will also enable informed inferences about the possible role of predation as a selective factor in the evolution of multicellularity.  The origin of multicellular animals from unicellular protozoans represents a pivotal transition in life's history.  This study focuses on resistance to being eaten by protozoan predators (before animals evolved, predators on chonaoflagellates were other protozoans).   Research goals are to:  1) quantify performance differences between unicellular and colonial choanoflagellates in avoiding predation by protozoan predators using different modes of prey capture;  2) elucidate fluid dynamics of interactions between predators and choanoflagellate prey to identify mechanisms underlying performance differences;  3) determine how fluctuating shear encountered by protozoans carried in turbulent water flow in nature affects interactions of unicellular vs. colonial prey with predators.  High-speed videomicrography of predators, prey, and flow-marking microbeads will record interactions of choanoflagellates with different protozoan predators. Digitized protozoan trajectories enable calculation of encounter and predation success rates, and behavioral interactions. Particle tracking velocimetry will quantify instantaneous flow fields produced by predators and prey, and hydrodynamic signals during their interactions.  A novel contribution is development of microfluidic techniques to determine how mechanisms of predator-prey interactions (usually studied in still water) are affected by realistic patterns of fluctuating shear that microscopic swimmers experience in turbulent ambient water flow."

Considering that the average body mass index of human populations is increasing and weight is a main risk factor for disease, understanding how diet affects physiology has broad societal implications. There is a gap in our understanding of how diet can change the physiology of an individual, and what genes influence that process. The digestive tract (gut) is the site of digestion, and therefore acts as an interface between ingested food and an individual. Recent work has shown that diet can affect the structure and function of this interface, and that there is strong variation among individuals in how the gut responds to diet. However, the consequences of gut plasticity and mechanisms underlying the responses to diet remain largely uncharacterized. This study aims to understand how the gut can respond to specific nutrients and regulate digestion and physiology using the fruit fly as a model system. This study will provide a new framework to understand nutrition, including the gut as an active and variable interface, and will thus pave the way for future work to optimize nutrition in agricultural applications and human nutritional interventions. This study will support the education of middle school, high school, and undergraduate students, and will promote the importance of model organisms for fundamental scientific discovery and the socio-economic benefits of such studies via a public website.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to explain whole-animal nutritional physiology in terms of gut function, nutritional sensing and flux, and gene activity in response to variation in nutrient ratios. The Drosophila adult midgut has the capacity to resize itself depending on diet. In particular, the ratio of nutrients in ingested food alters the size of the organ in a plastic manner, a phenomenon called adaptive growth (AG). This study aims to characterize the molecular mechanisms that underlie AG and determine how AG impacts organismal physiology. In addition, AG is highly variable between individuals, and the study aims to understand the genetic basis for inter-individual variation in gut AG. The study will 1) identify the specific nutrient(s) and conditions that trigger AG and determine if gut microbes are involved by utilizing a nutritional geometric framework in conjunction with metabolic assays and microbiology; 2) determine how gut structure is remodeled by food, with attention to gut regionalization and the impact of AG on nutrient assimilation, nutrient allocation patterns and fitness of the whole insect; and 3) identify the gene network that controls AG using transcriptomics and functional genetics, and identify the genes responsible for inter-individual variation in AG by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Altogether these results will characterize the impact of AG on whole organismal physiology and identify the molecular and genetic basis for gut plasticity to genetics, current gaps in our understanding of nutrition. The project will also impact middle school, high school, and undergraduate students, and support public education."

For example, darker-skinned African Americans have worse health outcomes, lower incomes, lower levels of education, lower rates of marriage, and even receive harsher criminal sentencing than lighter-skinned African Americans. This project explores how skin color might influence political phenomena such public policy outcomes and candidate support.  The work investigates this from the perspectives of both white and black people. This research has implications beyond just African Americans.  Studying skin tone identity among Latinos and Asian Americans, for instance, would provide interesting comparison points. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for understanding the significance of skin tone biases on a global bases, not just the United States.  Investigating potential color-based discrimination will help inform strategies for addressing and mitigating such bias, to the benefit of political elites (such as political candidates from minority groups) as well as for the mass public who might face skin-color based discrimination in their everyday lives.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The study of racial groups in political science tends to treat these as homogenous.  An implication of this approach is that such studies tend to overlook potentially important heterogeneity within racial groups, especially with respect to skin color.  The research utilizes a mixed-methods design, relying on multiple observational datasets, original qualitative interview data, and a series of experiments to explore the underlying significance of skin color in the political realm.  The findings from these multiple datasets and my in-depth interviews indicate that skin color is a socially and politically significant source of identity for many African Americans. This is especially true for darker-skinned African Americans. Further, skin color play a significant role in shaping political preferences in multiple domains. In contrast to existing theories of white racial attitudes towards blacks, I expect racially insensitive attitudes will not be equally directed at all African Americans, but will vary by skin tone. Overall, my research demonstrates that in addition to race, skin color operates as an important, yet poorly understood, factor in American politics."

While much research has focused on understanding species ranges at their expanding, leading-edges where they are becoming more abundant, less emphasis has been placed on understanding why populations would be declining at their lower latitude, trailing-edges. This project focuses on bird species found at their trailing-edges in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and examines how a variety of factors may contribute to their decline in numbers at this edge of their range. Specifically, this research will test the relative importance of: species tolerance to extreme temperatures and drought, competition with other species, mismatches between the availability of food sources and nesting times, and factors associated with having small population sizes and limited movement patterns. The results of this study will be important in efforts to conserve and manage species given changing environmental conditions and expected changes in the distributions of species. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in the development of different ecological modeling approaches, will develop a citizen sciences program, and will expose underserved high school STEM students to field ecology.  <br/> <br/>Theoretical work predicts that changing environmental conditions can interact with ecological processes to cause range shifts. Empirical studies have, however, failed to identify the relative contributions of species tolerances and mechanisms such as competition, phenological mismatches, density-dependence, and dispersal limitations in explaining these distributional shifts. This study uses experimental and observational data to determine the relative role physiological tolerances and other mechanisms play in explaining the population dynamics of several bird species found at their low-latitude range limits in the southern Appalachian Mountains. This study will overcome the limitations of species distribution models for understanding range shifts by developing novel spatio-temporal point process models that can be fitted to empirical data. This framework is unique in its ability to describe and predict ecological processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales while accounting for individual variation in demographic rates. This research will advance scientific understanding of range shifts, will produce a new framework for integrating theoretical and applied ecology, and will develop predictive models to inform the conservation of biodiversity."

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Prairie View A&M University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to access energy resources with vast available space and fewer restrictions and regulations. The project seeks to analyze floating offshore wind turbine uncertainties that arise due to the ocean environment and hydrodynamic calculations, as well as due to uncertainties in the structural and mechanical systems, which threaten the reliability and the feasibility of FOWTs. Undergraduate students, high school students and students from community colleges will gain research experiences through this project. <br/><br/>The current floating offshore wind turbine technologies have challenges to be resolved in order to produce sustainable and cost-effective power. Semi-submersible type FOWTs are known to be one of the most promising options with construction and maintenance cost problems yet to be solved. This project focuses on identification of the uncertainties and on estimating the structural safety factors. The research objectives of this project are to: understand the uncertainties that exist in FOWTs; predict the structural behavior and life-cycle structural reliability of FOWTs;  and obtain safety factors for structural design of semi-submersible-type FOWTs that uniquely consider the uncertainties and coupled dynamics of aerodynamics of the wind turbine and hydrodynamics of the floating body under extreme environmental loads. By considering the uncertainties found, the probabilistic capacity and demand models for structural components of FOWTs will be developed using a Bayesian Method. Lastly, the developed models will be used to estimate the life-cycle structural reliability and to obtain the safety factors for the base tower moment and shear forces of FOWTs. The results of this research may eventually reduce the current challenge of the high cost of FOWTs."

Accurate weather forecasts thus require numerical models with high enough resolution to represent critical details of the cyclones and their evolution, and it is important to understand what constitutes adequate resolution for this purpose.  Adequate resolution is likewise required to produce simulations which capture the response of cyclones and storm tracks to changes in global temperature, but it is again unclear what constitutes adequate resolution.  This is particularly an issue as the expense of such simulations increases strongly with resolution.<br/><br/>Previous work by the PIs suggests that high resolution is necessary to represent small pockets of intense precipitation within the cyclones that promote cyclone intensification and produce more energetic cyclones.  In addition, cyclones in the high resolution simulations are more intense under warmer conditions, due to the increase in latent heating that accompanies the rise in specific humidity with temperature.  But these results are somewhat inconclusive  as the simulations were performed with a regional model due to lack of access to global models with adequate resolution.<br/><br/>This project addresses the role of small-scale precipitation features in the intensification of cyclones, and the resulting potential for more energetic cyclones in a warming climate, using high-resolution simulations carried out as part of the United Kingdom UPSCALE project (UPSCALE is short for UK on PRACE - weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk, where PRACE is the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe).  The UPSCALE project has produced global simulations at medium and high resolutions (up to 25km), both for present-day climate conditions and for warmer climates which are projected to occur due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.  The simulations are ideally suited for the PIs' research although they were produced for other reasons.<br/><br/>The project is funded through the RAPID mechanism to expedite the research so that it can be conducted according to the timeline of the ongoing UK project.  A key issue in the timing is that UPSCALE is a precursor to the more intensive PRIMAVERA project, which will produce global simulations with resolutions as high as 5km.  PRIMAVERA is the European contribution to the HighResMIP sub-project of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6), which will inform the next assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Near-term results of this project can thus play a critical role in defining the research agenda of PRIMAVERA and informing the assessment report.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the dominant influence of extratropical cyclones on sensible weather over the US and other midlatitude regions, and the value of guidance regarding possible increases in cyclone intensity due to climate change.  The work also builds an international scientific collaboration which allows US PIs access to high-resolution simulations produced at substantial cost. In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation workforce in this research area."

However, evidence is at best mixed as to whether labeling has led to a decrease in calorie intake. The lack of clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of food labels suggests that that food-related decision-making is more complex than envisioned and that simply providing information about healthy and non-healthy food products may turn out not to be adequate to promote healthy eating. In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, the co-PI explores that possibility that healthy food choices are difficult because calorie dense foods induce temptation.  Temptation, in turn, distorts the perceived values of attributes of different food alternatives in such a way as to favor less healthy options.  The project also explores different solutions to the problem temptation poses in food decisions, such as developing appropriate commitment methods. The results of the project will enrich decision science and consumer research by improving theory and applying novel analysis methods to consumer decision making. The broader impacts will be provision of new insights to policy makers about possible ways of increasing the effectiveness of future public health related laws and improvement in public welfare through increasing our understanding of individual decision making.  <br/> <br/>The fundamental premise of the research to be undertaken is that temptation affects choice behavior through attribute distortion. Five experimental studies are designed to systematically analyze the role of temptation induced attribute distortion on choice. The first study examines food choice through the lens of a ""Temptation-Choice"" model where decisions under temptation involve an attribute distortion phenomenon. The second study explores the impact that findings on commitment in psychology have in the context of the ""Temptation-Choice"" model.  The third experiment explores the relationship between temptation and attribute distortion based on the predictions of the dual-self models. The fourth and fifth studies examine the influence different types of distraction have on peoples' ability to exercise self-control in the face of temptation."

Developmental research has shown that, while much linguistic knowledge develops in the first few years of life, children are not necessarily adept at quickly using this knowledge during real-time language comprehension. For example, as sentences unfold, adult listeners and readers are able to continuously predict how the sentences are likely to continue, based on their knowledge of language or the distribution of sentence structures. However, children's prediction mechanisms sometimes diverge from those of adults, and they must somehow develop adult-like predictive mechanisms during the course of language acquisition. Understanding this developmental process could lead to advances in the pedagogical techniques that aim to enhance language comprehension in children. This may also improve clinical intervention methodologies for adult patients with language disorders, whose comprehension mechanisms show similar characteristics to those of children's.<br/><br/>This project investigates the development and adaptation of filler-gap dependency processing mechanisms in children and adults. In comprehending questions like ""What was Emily eating the cake with -- ?,"" adults incrementally complete the dependency by associating the dislocated wh-phrase ""what"" with the verb, but children wait to complete the dependency until after the verb and its object is encountered. The main hypothesis of this project is that language experience and distributional regularities in the input play a key role in the development and adaptation of predictive processes in filler-gap dependency completion. The motivation for this hypothesis is two-fold. First, it is well established in developmental psychology that distributional regularities can bootstrap children's cognitive and linguistic development. Second, much work in adult psycholinguistics research has argued that syntactic priming, a processing facilitation that results from repetitions of abstract syntactic structures, reflects an implicit learning mechanism that adapts the comprehension procedures in accordance with the recent language experience. Taken together, children's comprehension mechanisms may adapt to an adult-like mechanism based on a) a long-term accumulation of filler-gap dependencies that complete at the verb position, as well as b) syntactic priming of such filler-gap dependencies within an experimental session. Conversely, adults' comprehension mechanisms should also adapt to the child-like, conservative mechanism after exposure to filler-gap dependencies that are completed at a post-verbal position. To test these predictions, Dr. Omaki will conduct i) a corpus study that investigates the distributional patterns of English filler-gap dependencies in adults' conversations and child-directed speech, and ii) five eye-tracking experiments with children and adults that explore the time course of filler-gap dependency processing, as well as its interaction with priming sentences that are designed to create a bias towards the alternative dependency completion mechanism. As such, this project links questions and methodologies in two traditionally separate fields of adult psycholinguistics and language development."

This leads to widespread social-economic problems including lower participation in the labor force, heightened reliance on public assistance, poorer outcomes among offspring, and lower civic involvement. It is estimated that this costs the US more than $255 billion annually in lost tax revenue due to unemployment, lowered productivity, and crime. There is a critical need to understand the fundamental cognitive building blocks involved in learning to read, in order to improve the well-being of individuals in society and to improve economic competitiveness. The present project will lay the necessary scientific groundwork to advance understanding of how this learning develops across childhood and into young adulthood. The research team has discovered a connection between poor reading in developmental  dyslexia  and  phonetic acquisition, a foundational aspect of learning to read. Building from this, the project will advance understanding of the developmental course of this learning in relation to mathematical, cognitive and language skills. The research will advance theoretical models of spoken and written language and will support evidence-based approaches to improving the level at which Americans read. The project's broader impact is enhanced by its implications for developmental dyslexia,  a common developmental disorder that affects approximately 7% of the population. The research team will also be active in communicating their scientific discoveries to the public to promote STEM literacy in the community. An additional outcome will be training a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate scientists.<br/><br/>We do not yet adequately understand the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that support learning to read, or how they may falter in poor readers. We do know that low literacy is not an isolated limitation in learning written language. Rather, it is associated with diverse learning challenges extending broadly to other aspects of language and even to visual and motor learning. In this context, the core hypothesis of the present project is that domain-general procedural learning supports development of robust phoneme categories,  with  associated benefits for literacy acquisition. The research team's prior work established that poorer reading skill among adults is associated with poor incidental learning of nonlinguistic auditory categories. The objective of the present project is to characterize procedural auditory category learning and its relationship to reading skill across development. The project involves a bi-national US-Israeli research team with cross-cutting expertise to examine procedural auditory category learning (1) from early childhood to young adulthood to capture earlier and later stages of literacy acquisition and maturation of memory systems; (2) in relation to developing language, cognitive and mathematical abilities, and individual differences; (3) in English and Hebrew, for which literacy demands are distinct; (4) in the context of procedural learning impairments of children and adults with developmental dyslexia; and (5) across periods of offline learning to characterize consolidation and retention of learning. In sum, the project attempts a comprehensive examination of procedural auditory category learning. It will advance understanding of the basic building blocks of literacy with the potential to transform research and theory in the field and to advance evidence-based approaches to addressing low literacy in the US.<br/><br/>This project is being supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called ""Faces and Voices of Science"" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds. The videos will be made available online for teachers and professors to incorporate in lectures.<br/><br/><br/>Visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently.  One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

There is a critical need for improved metrology science in micro- and nano-scale ultra-precision manufacturing of freeform surfaces. The objective of this research is to improve measurement capabilities for such ultra-precision optical surfaces. This surface measurement is important not only after an optic device has been produced, but also during manufacturing to assess the process performance. Existing measurement methods suffer from fundamental errors that limit the achievable accuracy. Additionally, traditional techniques often interrupt the manufacturing process and limit productivity. In this research, on-machine metrology using a novel measurement strategy will be used to improve manufacturing capabilities for challenging optical components. The results of this work will be used to improve freeform measurement capabilities and will therefore lead to scientific advances in the optical, illumination, energy, aerospace, and biomedical fields. Other broader impacts include the two-week ""Precision Engineering-Oriented Multidisciplinary Internship Program"" at Tennessee Technological University, a permanent gallery that highlights precision engineering-based historic devices at the Cookeville Children's Museum, Cookeville, Tennessee, and ""Project Engineering for Me (E4Me)"" that targets middle school girls in the urban Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system. These educational efforts will expose K-12 students to STEM research and careers with a focus on precision engineering.<br/> <br/>The research objective is to eliminate cosine error in freeform surface measurement by integrating a novel fiber-optic sensor in an on-machine measurement configuration. Cosine error in surface profile measurement results from an angular misalignment between the measurement axis and the axis of motion and limits the measurement accuracy. This is especially true in measurements of Fresnel lenses, gratings, spherical/aspherical surfaces, and high-order polynomial surfaces, for example. Cosine error cannot be eliminated in current freeform surface measurement strategies because the measuring tools do not measure along the direction normal to the measurement plane. A novel methodology for freeform surfaces by integrating fiber optic techniques (autofocusing, Fizeau interferometry) in an on-machine configuration is planned. The project's approach also avoids machine tool error motions because the measurement path coincides with the machining path. By answering fundamental questions regarding the performance limits of the approach, it is expected that this research will produce new knowledge in high-precision, on-machine instrumentation."

These mutualisms are important for stabilizing pristine natural communities, restoring degraded environments, and plant productivity in agricultural systems. Rhizobial bacteria (rhizobia) benefit leguminous host plants (peas, beans, soybean) by fixing atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms, essentially fertilizing their plant hosts. As a result, legumes are high in nitrogen and provide an abundant source of plant-derived protein. Rhizobial strains, however, are diverse in nature and vary quite a bit in partner quality, or the level of benefits they provide to the plant host. This project focuses on a genetic model system (the legume Medicago truncatula and its partner bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti) to investigate the range of partner quality variation and its underlying molecular basis in rhizobia, integrating various approaches including whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression, and metabolomics. These techniques provide insight into the genetic determinants and cellular-level metabolism that characterizes highly-beneficial interactions, versus low-quality interactions that are less beneficial for plant hosts. Understanding what determines partner quality at a mechanistic level is critical foundational knowledge that informs efforts to engineer the plant microbiome as part of plant improvement programs and sustainable crop production. Moreover a basic understanding of what determines partner quality is important for understanding how mutualisms evolve through time and how crucial mutualisms persist in current environments. This project provides biological and computational training at the undergraduate and graduate level, provides internships for local community college students, and generates online outreach and analysis tools.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>Mutualists in nature vary widely in partner quality, often with important implications for natural and managed systems, yet the molecular basis of mutualist partner quality variation is not well-understood. Recently studies have demonstrated mutualism decline in response to environmental changes, resulting from dis-association of partners, ecological shifts towards less-mutualistic species, or evolutionary decreases in mean partner quality. A predictive understanding of mutualisms is needed to understand their coevolution, persistence, and potential decline. This project will integrate natural genetic variation with physiological and molecular traits into symbiosis networks to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying the mutualism between the rhizobium Ensifer (Sinorhizobium) meliloti and its host plant Medicago truncatula. The central hypothesis is that naturally-occurring variation can be used to better resolve the genetic regulation of plant and rhizobium metabolic pathways that contribute to high-quality symbiosis. This project integrates rhizobium genome-wide nucleotide variation with both rhizobia and host plant phenotypic and molecular traits to address the molecular basis of rhizobium partner quality (how much rhizobia benefit their plant hosts), a trait relevant to both natural and managed ecosystems. Network analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data will result in comparative models of high and low quality symbiosis, enabling gene-to-trait predictions for the ecologically- and evolutionarily- important symbiosis between leguminous plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobium bacteria. Hypotheses generated by network analysis will be validated in both rhizobia and host plant systems for physiological and molecular phenotypes underlying important partner quality traits."

Achieving this requires intimate interactions between male (pollen) and female (pistil) to enable growth of a pollen tube to deliver sperm to the embryo sac inside an ovule (the precursor of a seed) for fertilization. The project utilizes the model plant Arabidopsis to understand the molecular designs and biochemical reactions behind these interactions. The focus is on two classes of molecules, one is a family of low molecular weight proteins called, Rapid Alkanization Factors, the other is a class of proteins called receptor kinases and includes a molecule called FERONIA and related proteins. Rapid Alkanization Factors are believed to serve as signals to instruct how these receptor kinases should react in successful pollination and fertilization processes. The goal is to identify the interacting pairs of the Alikinazation Factor and receptor kinase, understand how they interact and their importance to the reproductive process. Given reproduction underlies agricultural yields as well as survival of the species, results from this study should contribute to rational designs aiming at protecting plant species as well as ensuring food supply. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral students. Findings and materials produced will be shared with the scientific community through publications, with the broader public by being introduced as topics in STEM workshops for high school teachers. <br/><br/>Pollen grains germinate on the receptive surface of the pistil, each producing a tube to transport two sperm cells to an embryo sac where the egg cell is located inside an ovule (the precursor organ for a seed). The embryo sac induces rupture of the penetrating pollen tube to release sperm rendering them available for fertilization. This project will rely on biochemical and genetic approaches to examine how RALF-FER and RALF-FER related receptor kinase interactions underlie pollen tube growth and rupture. Several pollen- or ovule-expressed Rapid Alkanization Factors (RALFs), the female-expressed FERONIA (FER) and three related pollen-expressed receptor kinases are selected for the study here. Biochemical efforts will focus on producing pure and active RALFs for testing their activity in pollen tube growth behavior in defined culture medium. Genetic efforts will center on determining the precise temporal and spatial expression pattern of the RALFs and generating mutations in individual RALFs, or combinatorially in multiple RALFs, to determine the impact of their loss on pollination and fertilization. Though some functional roles are emerging for RALFs and the FER family of proteins, e.g. in growth, development, reproduction, defense and symbiosis, most remain unknown. While important in its own right, especially given the impact agricultural production to society, the functional relationship established here could provide a model for studies that extend beyond pollen-pistil and plant reproduction to almost all aspects of plant growth, development and survival."

Although many classes of these attacks are seemingly unrelated, in reality, many of them stem from the stateless nature of the web, where no safeguards exist to ensure that a resource that was linked to yesterday is the same resource being accessed today. As a result, enforcing link integrity holds the promise of mitigating a multitude of security attacks.<br/><br/>However, the dynamicity of the web poses challenges to link integrity schemes, which must cope with constant benign changes while flagging the malicious ones.  Pursuing this line of research requires a fundamental understanding of the security aspects of the web?s dynamic nature.

This project aims to quantify the stability of web links by developing a custom web crawler infrastructure and tools that will collect security-related metadata about remote resources.  The gathering and subsequent assessing of this metadata is a critical first step to demonstrate the feasibility of developing robust link integrity schemes that can be used to detect abnormal content and infrastructure changes (indicative of an ongoing attack) while keeping false positives to a minimum."

Magmas may make continental breakup possibly by heating up and weakening continental tectonic plates. Volcanism associated with these events has also been associated with major extinction events on Earth. Despite the importance of magmatism during continental breakup, very little is known about the total volume of magmatism involved during rifting and how the volume varies between rift systems. The continental margin off the coast of the eastern U.S. is one of the best examples in the world of a continental breakup event associated with extensive magmatism. One of the biggest magmatic events in history occurred during the breakup of the supercontinent of Pangea and opening of the Atlantic Ocean.  This project will involve the analysis of existing marine seismic data collected across the margin offshore North Carolina in 2014 to quantify the volume and distribution of magma frozen in the crust and how it relates to the structures that allowed breakup to occur. The project supports the training of an undergraduate student.<br/><br/>Magmatic intrusions contribute to the growth and modification of the crust of the Earth and strongly influence strain localization in a variety of tectonic settings.  Despite this, very few constraints exist on the 3-D distribution of magmatic intrusions throughout the crust in a tectonic setting that can be used to understand the controls on their distribution and the consequences for crustal modification and deformation.  This project focuses on magmatism in rifts, but the scientific questions apply across many tectonic settings. Do intrusions exploit pre-existing structures and/or are they focused in the areas of greatest crustal/lithospheric thinning? Does the volume of intrusions in magmatic rifts vary along strike and relate to segmentation at the mid-ocean ridge, or does voluminous magmatism overwhelm focusing mechanisms and result in a more uniform distribution of intrusions along the margin? A 3D seismic velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle will be built in one of the type examples of magma-rich continental rifting: The Eastern North American Margin (ENAM).  The NSF-GeoPRISMS Program supported the collection of active/passive, onshore/offshore seismic data across the ENAM in 2014. As a part of this experiment, data were also collected along and across the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly, which is thought to mark the location of significant synrift magmatism.  The data provide excellent 3-D ray coverage of the ENAM area and will be used for 3-D travel time tomography. The resulting velocity model will be used to map the 3-D distribution of magmatic intrusions. This part of the margin is an excellent place to test competing ideas for controls on synrift magmatic addition to the crust."

However, the impact of auxin on bacterial plant interactions is not well understood.  This project seeks to better understand the mechanisms through which auxin promotes disease caused by two plant pathogens: Pseudomonas syringae, the causal agent of bacterial speck disease of a variety of plants, and Dickeya spp., the causal agent of bacterial soft rot, an important pathogen of potato. Previous research has found that auxin plays multiple roles during P. syringae pathogenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana, including suppression of host defenses and regulating pathogen gene expression. The current project will focus on three questions: i) How does auxin produced by P. syringae impact host biology to promote disease susceptibility? ii) How does auxin impact expression of P. syringae virulence factors?, and iii) Does auxin production by Dickeya contribute to disease on potato? The results of this project will be an improved understanding of the roles of auxin during pathogenesis of P. syringae and Dickeya spp. As both pathogens infect a large number of crops, knowledge gained through this work will serve as a foundation for understanding other important plant-pathogen interactions to facilitate the design of more effective disease control strategies. In addition, since these studies include the investigation of a pathogen, Dickeya, that is of immediate concern to U.S. potato farmers, results will provide pertinent information that can be used to enhance disease management practices and provide new targets for broad range disease control.<br/><br/>Technical Paragraph:<br/>	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a naturally occurring form of auxin, promotes growth of P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000) on A. thaliana.  IAA, in addition to being a plant hormone, is also a microbial signaling molecule that many plant-associated microbes synthesize and/or respond to. Thus, IAA can potentially act through several different mechanisms to promote pathogenesis, including suppressing host defenses, altering host physiology, and directly impacting pathogen biology. The primary goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxin promotes the virulence of PstDC3000 during infection of A. thaliana and other hosts. The multidisciplinary collaboration between the two research groups engages the complimentary expertise in the two labs and will utilize bacterial genetics, state of the art global transcriptional analysis and metabolic profiling to further understanding of the roles auxin plays in regulating plant-pathogen interactions. The results of this study will be transformative, as they will be instrumental in the discovery of determinants involved in plant-microbe interactions.  The project will provide valuable new insight into the signaling molecules and events regulating pathogen and host gene expression during infection. Specifically, the project has the following objectives: 1) Investigating the direct effects of auxin on PstDC3000, 2) Identification and characterization of PstDC3000 mutants with altered sensitivity to auxin, 3) Investigate the roles of P. syringae-derived auxin during pathogenesis, and 4) Investigating the contribution of pathogen-derived auxin to virulence in agriculturally relevant plant-pathogen interactions."

This project seeks to test the emancipation hypothesis proposed by Tinbergen 60 years ago to understand how a novel behavior arises by using a hybrid zone between two species of hummingbirds. The novel behavior is a courtship display that is performed by one species, Allen's Hummingbird, and not the other, Rufous Hummingbird. In this stereotyped display, called the 'pendulum display', the male flies back and forth over a female while producing distinctive sounds with his wings. The investigators will record displays from 400 birds from within a hybrid zone between these two species, and then search for genes associated with individual components of the behavior, by sequencing the genomes of these 400 birds. Understanding how one behavior splits into two will reveal a fundamental mechanism of how behavior evolves.  Additionally, this grant will train of students of diverse backgrounds, and enable outreach to the California School for the Deaf, Riverside by funding purchase of an 'acoustic camera', allowing deaf children to learn more about sound through this newly invented way of visualizing it. <br/><br/>As the genetic underpinnings of how one behavior splits into two 'paramorphs', alternate forms of a previously unitary character, have not been demonstrated for any behavior, the analyses presented here aim to do so for the first time. This 3-year study has three objectives: (1) Hybrid zone mapping and cline analysis: phenotype, genotype, and selection (2): Sequence analysis of complex display behavior, and (3): Admixture mapping of behavior and morphology. Together these objectives will provide information about selection on the display traits of interest, and test the paramorph hypothesis directly, using phenotypic and genotypic data respectively. Current data indicate no fixed genetic differences between the species within coding regions of the genome, hinting that the paramorphic behavior could be driven by differences in gene regulation between the two species, rather than as the result of a paralogous gene.  Just as the modern view of morphological diversity was transformed by the study of its genetic basis, a direct assessment of the genes underlying a behavior that varies across a hybrid zone will allow one of the first tests of how a complex motor pattern has evolved.

A physician's ability to address skin issues is highly dependent on a physician's prior visual training experiences. However, many physicians are not regularly familiar with the over 2,000 dermatology issues that can arise in a patient. The algorithms developed here allow for objective and much more accurate screening of exposed skin to improve evaluation of patient issues in many different care settings. This could be implemented for many different types of skin diseases and other visual constructions of images to assist physicians visually and vastly augment their sensitivity and specificity at identifying dermatology issues and their underlying causes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on using image processing and machine learning to distinguish dermatological diseases. Image-capturing electronics such as consumer-grade cameras and smartphones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, capable, and affordable. Image processing and machine learning based on annotated images has shown great potential for algorithms to differentiate between images capturing different objects and patterns. The developments here have created a classification system that differentiates suspicious from non-suspicious lesions that is easy for a physician to use in a clinical setting to help with clinical decision-making. The proof of concept is based on a large dataset of prospective clinical images where the algorithms classified malignant cases and the methods resulted in a statistically significant discrimination between suspicious and non-suspicious lesions."

There is a critical need for improved metrology science in micro- and nano-scale ultra-precision manufacturing of freeform surfaces. The objective of this research is to improve measurement capabilities for such ultra-precision optical surfaces. This surface measurement is important not only after an optic device has been produced, but also during manufacturing to assess the process performance. Existing measurement methods suffer from fundamental errors that limit the achievable accuracy. Additionally, traditional techniques often interrupt the manufacturing process and limit productivity. In this research, on-machine metrology using a novel measurement strategy will be used to improve manufacturing capabilities for challenging optical components. The results of this work will be used to improve freeform measurement capabilities and will therefore lead to scientific advances in the optical, illumination, energy, aerospace, and biomedical fields. Other broader impacts include the two-week ""Precision Engineering-Oriented Multidisciplinary Internship Program"" at Tennessee Technological University, a permanent gallery that highlights precision engineering-based historic devices at the Cookeville Children's Museum, Cookeville, Tennessee, and ""Project Engineering for Me (E4Me)"" that targets middle school girls in the urban Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system. These educational efforts will expose K-12 students to STEM research and careers with a focus on precision engineering.<br/> <br/>The research objective is to eliminate cosine error in freeform surface measurement by integrating a novel fiber-optic sensor in an on-machine measurement configuration. Cosine error in surface profile measurement results from an angular misalignment between the measurement axis and the axis of motion and limits the measurement accuracy. This is especially true in measurements of Fresnel lenses, gratings, spherical/aspherical surfaces, and high-order polynomial surfaces, for example. Cosine error cannot be eliminated in current freeform surface measurement strategies because the measuring tools do not measure along the direction normal to the measurement plane. A novel methodology for freeform surfaces by integrating fiber optic techniques (autofocusing, Fizeau interferometry) in an on-machine configuration is planned. The project's approach also avoids machine tool error motions because the measurement path coincides with the machining path. By answering fundamental questions regarding the performance limits of the approach, it is expected that this research will produce new knowledge in high-precision, on-machine instrumentation."

The conference theme is Integrating Environment and Health. It will be an opportunity for STEM researchers, educators, and students in higher education, K-12, and informal education to gather with leaders from business, industry, government, and civil society working in the fields of environment and health to develop a common vision, share best practices, and develop new partnerships in order to advance the convergence of environmental and health sciences and engineering.<br/><br/>The health of people and the health of the planet are intrinsically, intricately, and intimately interconnected, but separate disciplines and professions have developed each with their own programs and terminology that even use similar terms such as environmental health or environmental health sciences differently. The 2017 conference seeks to advance convergence towards an approach to prepare scientists, educators, and practitioners to explore and understand the connections and apply them in their professional activities. The conference will be: 1. A forum for scholars, educators, students, professionals and policymakers to share new science, best practices, and develop new partnerships. 2. An opportunity for academics to gather with leaders from business, industry, government, and civil society to raise the profile and expand the effectiveness of scholarship that connects health and environment. 3. An arena to help scientists and policymakers consider how research can inform and be translated into policy and practices. 4. A platform designed to catalyze new initiatives and partnerships. One of the conference's primary purposes is to help build a convergent interdisciplinary field of environment and health. Desired outcomes include: 1. Helping to build communities of practice in environment and health utilizing collaborative approaches to identify critical scientific and technological needs, learning outcomes, and effective practices in key areas. 2. An avenue for enhanced STEM literacy for students in all disciplines based on critical thinking about health and its relationships with various environmental issues (climate change, pollution, international security, environmental capital and the value (cost) of nature as it relates to health impacts, and other challenges of modern society). 3. New pathways for teaching about environment and health. 4. Stronger research programs that more effectively take innovations in science and technology to the demonstration and deployment stages. The project will help advance a broadly-defined, interdisciplinary field of environment and health that includes elements of science, technology, policy, ethics, environmental, health and biomedical sciences. A broader integration of environment and health science will serve society helping to elucidate the health benefits of environmental protection, extend the relevance and practicality of STEM education, and forge critical connections with research on health and the environment. The impacts of the project will be evaluated through electronic surveys during and at the conclusion of the conference and a follow-up survey six months after the conference as well as a post-conference discussion with the conference planning committee."

It is important to make solar panels as efficient as possible so that the number of panels needed to obtain a certain amount of power can be reduced in order to save on installation costs. Tandem cells, comprised of a top cell that harvests the visible portion of the spectrum and a bottom cell that harvests the infrared portion, are the most promising way to achieve higher efficiencies. Silicon, which is used in approximately 92% of the solar panels that are manufactured each year, is ideal for the bottom cell and typically has 16-21 % efficiency by itself. Perovskite semiconductors are highly attractive for the top cell because they can be tuned to have the right bandgap and have efficiency as high as 22%. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the first 30%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project describes plans for a perovskite expert, Professor Michael McGehee, to partner with a silicon expert, Professor Zachary Holman, to make perovskites/silicon tandem solar cells. This team has made a prototype two-terminal monolithic device with a power conversion efficiency of 25.3 %. They hold the world record for this type of device and are in a very strong position to increase the efficiency to 30% over the next two years. This development is especially exciting because their packaged perovskite solar cells have already passed the PV industry standard damp heat and temperature cycling tests and it is likely that panels with these cells could be manufactured at a cost of < $100/m2. The bandgap of perovskites can be tuned from 1.2 eV to 2.3 eV using the materials set ABX3, where A is a mixture of methylammonium, formamidinium or cesium, B is a mixture of tin and lead, and X is a mixture of bromine or iodine. The most important research goal of this project is to find the optimal combination of these components for making a stable and high-quality semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The team will thoroughly characterize the semiconductors it makes to guide the process of optimizing the properties. Additional research goals of this project are to develop high-mobility TCO layers for the front of the tandem solar cells, improve the infrared response of the silicon bottom cell while decreasing its cost via a porous dielectric/metal rear reflector, and fabricate PDMS layers with scattering textures to be used at the front of the tandem to reduce reflectance.<br/>This project has the potential to change our future energy landscape through the development of efficient yet inexpensive PV technologies. The project will also train a diverse pool of students and the results will be disseminated broadly. Holman is the PI of an NSF REU site into which the proposed project will be integrated. Approximately once every 18 months McGehee gives a lecture that is intended to be easy to understand even for people who are not yet scientists and posts it on YouTube.  These lectures are typically viewed more than 20,000 times by a wide variety of people. <br/>"

From mundane online fraud detection to the most sophisticated uses of computer vision, these applications share an insatiable appetite for massive labeled training data. The primary source of high-quality labels is crowdsourcing, and research to date on crowdsourcing has focused on the key problem of how to maximize the production of high-quality crowdsourced labels per dollar spent, for problems where workers must choose between just a few predefined labels.  However, more open-ended labeling problems have grown to constitute almost half of crowdsourced tasks today, and open-ended tasks raise an entirely new set of research challenges for crowdsourced data management.<br/><br/>This activity addresses the key new research challenges in managing and optimizing open-ended crowdsourcing. Since open-ended crowdsourcing employs tasks with a large number of alternatives, humans struggle to select error-free ones. Additional challenges emerge in determining the open-ended task types appropriate for a specific problem, developing schemes to ascertain the right answer given open-ended worker responses, and inferring the hidden perspectives behind worker answers. The activity targets open-ended crowdsourcing problems that span nearly 90% of those used in practice today, with wide applicability in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning in general. The technical outcomes of the activity include the first foundational principles for open-ended crowdsourced data management, which in turn will expand the reach of machine learning into new and more challenging domains and more effective solutions in existing applications that impact our everyday lives. The pedagogical outcomes of the activity include a course on human-in-the-loop data analytics, crowdsourcing education modules for school teachers, as well as a quantification and dissemination of how crowdsourcing is performed in practice, along with a benchmark to accelerate crowdsourcing research in the future."

Analysis of 2-D seismic reflection profiles across the continent-ocean transition will delineate along-strike and margin-dip variations of seaward-dipping reflections age and character, of pre- syn- and post-rift sedimentary sequences, and igneous basement character and crustal structure. The data will provide critical information about margin segmentation during rift initiation and evolution and magmatic distribution. The ENAM is a well-preserved, mature rifted margin created during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic that records multiple stages of Paleozoic continental amalgamation, lithospheric breakup and the interaction with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the largest and most enigmatic igneous provinces worldwide. This project will examine how magmatism is distributed along and across the margin, how it correlates with both pre-existing suture zones and with modern segmentation at mid-oceanic ridges, and whether the margin is overprinted by the voluminous CAMP emplacement."

Lab studies have shown that warm-blooded organisms lose heat at a more rapid rate when wet and must spend more energy to regulate body temperature. Effects of rainfall on energy expenditure in the wild is unstudied, but may critically affect reproduction and survival of organisms. Energy is often most limited to animals when trying to raise offspring, with the latter especially vulnerable to increased energy costs of wetting because of poorly developed fur or feathers. This project examines energy costs of rainfall to parents and their offspring in tropical songbirds. Tropical organisms provide an important test because they are thought to be sensitive to heat loss and thermal conditions due to the narrow temperature variation in the tropics. Also, rain is a prevalent feature in tropical rain forests (often > 2 m per year).  Investigations will examine energy expenditure of both parents and offspring on dry versus wet days and at nests where rainfall is experimentally modified. Measurements will be conducted across diverse species that differ in their behaviors, nest types and potential exposure to rain to advance understanding of the energetic costs and differential population vulnerabilities of species as a result of variation in rainfall. This work has important conservation implications because it identifies population sensitivities of endemic species in a biodiversity hotspot. In addition, many students from a variety of disciplines, including those outside of biology will be trained in the conduct of field work and scientific principles. <br/><br/>Ecological and evolutionary influences of precipitation are poorly studied. Proposed work will significantly advance understanding of the energetic (field metabolic rates) and demographic consequences of variation in rainfall on coexisting songbirds in a tropical rainforest. These costs may be strongly expressed in tropical rainforests where rain is prevalent, thermal tolerances are narrow, and temperatures are often below thermoneutral levels. Yet, studies of the effects of rainfall and wetting on energetics, behavior and demography across diverse tropical species are lacking. The proposed work will use novel experimental and observational approaches to advance understanding of how nest structure affects energy use of parents due to heat loss under wet versus dry conditions. The proposed work will also elucidate how rain, temperature, nest structure, and parental behavior combine to affect energy expenditure of offspring and how energy is allocated to differing body components during growth. Finally, it will reveal demographic ramifications of the physiological costs of rain and nest structure to gain new insight into fitness consequences. Ultimately, this work will provide a new understanding of the influences of climate and nest structure upon heat balance and evolution of parental and growth strategies among diverse species. This work will also identify relative demographic sensitivities of species as a function of their nest types, ecologies and behaviors to aid prioritization schemes for conservation. A large number of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doctoral scholar, will receive training in diverse field methodologies and scientific principles."

However, little is known about the long-term variability of deepwater formation, or whether it has changed as a function of regional climate patterns.  This project will generate new records of deep ocean ventilation and surface climate conditions in the northen Red Sea, where modern deepwater formation can serve as a model for larger-scale global processes.  These records will provide insight into the temporal variability and mechanisms controlling Red Sea deepwater formation over the past few centuries. A better understanding of long-term variability in ocean circulation is critical to understanding how the climate system operates, especially for identifying patterns of natural background variability and quantifying the contribution of anthropogenic forcing to recent global changes.  Increasing our knowledge of how such ocean variability may be linked to large-scale climate oscillations may enable us to predict future changes and potentially mitigate their impacts on society.  This project will provide training and mentorship for one Ph.D. student as well as undergraduate and high school guest students, and will support outreach through multimedia presentations of coral reef science to K-12 classrooms and the general public several times each year.<br/><br/>This research will reconstruct variability in deep ocean mixing and Red Sea Outflow Water (RSOW) formation in the northern Red Sea using surface ocean radiocarbon (14C) measurements.  Massive corals preserve records of ocean chemistry in their skeletons, and long coral drill cores from the far northern Red Sea are ideally situated to monitor surface 14C in this important location.  14C will be measured on homogenized samples from individual growth layers in an existing annually-banded Porites lobata/lutea coral drill core extending back nearly 230 years.  Low 14C values will reflect the strength of the cyclonic gyre circulation in the northern Red Sea, and provide a record of deep ventilation and the mixing of 14C-depleted deep water into the surface layer.  The time series will be analyzed to identify patterns of temporal variability and will be compared to indices of large-scale regional or hemispheric climate (such as the Arctic Oscillation) to test the hypothesis that such climate patterns control the formation of RSOW, through the influence on cyclonic gyre circulation and deep mixing, which ""preconditions"" surface waters for densification and sinking prior to extreme winter atmospheric cooling."

The investigated methods will significantly increase the difficulty for attackers to bypass the applied countermeasure and sabotage the original chip design. To protect IP cores from reverse engineering and IP piracy attacks, this project investigates a dynamically-deflective obfuscation method. This project also explores an interlocked dynamic hardening method to protect Networks-on-Chip from bandwidth depletion and information leaking.

The project supports the training of two graduate students, one at the University of New Mexico (a minority serving institution) and the other at Southern Methodist University. <br/><br/><br/>This project investigates the relationship between extension, magmatism and margin segmentation in the early stages of western Atlantic rifting using the amphibious active-source seismic dataset collected during the Eastern North American Margin (ENAM) Community Seismic Experiment. Analysis of two margin-normal seismic refraction profiles spanning the coastline from extended continental crust to mature oceanic crust and of one margin-parallel profile along the rupture zone and the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly will constrain the record of early extension onshore, define the continental-oceanic transition and the lateral extent of pre- and syn-rift magma emplacement and margin segmentation. Analysis of 2-D seismic reflection profiles across the continent-ocean transition will delineate along-strike and margin-dip variations of seaward-dipping reflections age and character, of pre- syn- and post-rift sedimentary sequences, and igneous basement character and crustal structure. The data will provide critical information about margin segmentation during rift initiation and evolution and magmatic distribution. The ENAM is a well-preserved, mature rifted margin created during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic that records multiple stages of Paleozoic continental amalgamation, lithospheric breakup and the interaction with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), one of the largest and most enigmatic igneous provinces worldwide. This project will examine how magmatism is distributed along and across the margin, how it correlates with both pre-existing suture zones and with modern segmentation at mid-oceanic ridges, and whether the margin is overprinted by the voluminous CAMP emplacement."

At the center of this geospatial labor was the Student-NonViolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which generated a series of detailed reports and other products that informed civil rights projects but which have been largely neglected by social scientists.  From their field-based operations in Deep Southern small towns and rural areas, SNCC workers strategically compiled, disseminated and interpreted spatial and social information for the purposes of documenting and challenging the normative power of white supremacy and racial inequality.  Understanding how Civil Rights organizations engaged in this ""Geospatial Intelligence"" (GI) advances an understanding of the potential of geographical data collection, application, and analysis to be utilized for the purposes of non-elite activism and social change. This research project contributes to Geographic knowledge and has the potential to impact Geographic curriculum and public thought through its plan of publication and innovative outreach.  Specifically, the investigators will distribute research findings to a broad collection of community actors, including through the Tennessee Geographic Alliance and its partners within the state alliance movement and the National Council for Social Studies. They will create education materials for both the broader public and to facilitate classroom teaching and learning about the role of space and place in challenging segregation and discrimination during the Civil Rights Movement.  In addition, findings of the research will be disseminated via the University of Tennessee ""Pipeline Program"", which offers an opportunity to engage with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and to recruit minority students for further graduate education.  <br/><br/>This research project relies on archival work at several Civil Rights related collections across the United States as well as a series of open-ended interviews with surviving members of SNCC familiar with the generation and implementation of geospatial data gathering and analysis techniques. Critical race theory and methodology and discourse analysis will be used to investigate the following questions: 1) How and in what ways and political contexts did civil rights workers employ mapping and geographical data collection and analysis strategies to identify patterns of racial inequality and targets for protest?  2) How did Civil Rights workers use or operationalize their Geospatial Intelligence methods and analytical products to plan and execute major civil rights projects and how do those products expand our definition and understanding of Black Geographies? 3) How do everyday forms of Geospatial Intelligence used by Civil Rights workers problematize and expand contemporary understandings of GI that strongly associate Geospatial Intelligence with defense and national security concerns? While the focal point of academic work for over a decade, GI-related research confines the craft to military-industrial applications.  SNCC's use of geographical data and GI practice expands this definition and context as well as understanding of the inner workings of African American politics and the value of a Black Geographies perspective within a study of the Civil Rights Movement."

In a typical adhesive bond, the outside edges of the adhesive carry most of the peeling load and are the most likely point of failure. By creating a functionally graded adhesive joint with soft, flexible edges and a stiffer core, the stress may be distributed more evenly, increasing joint strength substantially; indeed, enhancements of up to 60 percent have been reported via this approach in the limited testing conducted to date. While such results are highly promising, no one has identified a means of creating functionally graded adhesive joints whose properties are stable over time. This work seeks to investigate the basic science behind functionally graded adhesives whose properties are controlled by adjusting exposure to radiation.  Epoxy resins will be formulated for this effort; their thermal and mechanical properties will be measured, and adhesive joints based on these materials will be graded via exposure to varying doses of gamma rays and tested for strength.  In tandem, computer simulations will use the measured properties to predict joint performance, with actual joint performance data used to validate the simulations. The resultant computational design tools will provide information on how best to design functionally graded joints. The efforts will open up an almost entirely unexplored field related to the preparation and study of functionally graded adhesives by removing key barriers that currently prevent such investigations. The success of this work will enable engineers to create stronger, lighter, more reliable adhesive bonds, and make more efficient use of high performance composites. The most immediate impact is likely to be felt in sectors where composites and lightweight metals are heavily used - aerospace, ship-building, ground transportation, and wind energy - with many other areas of application to follow as the implications and benefits of these efforts become apparent.  Furthermore, results will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses, work will be carried out to demonstrate applications through undergraduate engineering capstone projects and extracurricular activities (such as Formula SAE Competition team), and graduate students along with REU students will be trained and integrated into the research effort,  <br/><br/>Structural adhesive joints suffer from stress concentrations at their edges, while sensitivity to manufacturing flaws has made many reluctant to use them. The gradual introduction of load through a functionally graded adhesive (FGA) - soft at the edges, stiff in the middle, for instance - addresses both issues. Recent theoretical work predicts dramatic gains in joint strength using FGAs, a conclusion confirmed by the few experimental efforts reported in literature. The slow progress in this area stems from the difficulties in making consistent, stable, robust FGAs. Coupled with a lack of validated knowledge in the area, this has precluded their application. The overall objective is to understand how to design, create, characterize and predict the properties of FGA joints, with the long-term goal of increased joint performance, stability, and reliability. The central hypothesis of this work is that stable property gradients designed using predictive models will enable stronger, more stable bonded joints. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of the design, creation and behavior of FGAs. Design rules for FGA joints will be identified, general methods to create and characterize FGAs and FGA joints will be realized, and predictions of FGA joint properties will be validated. This effort will expand our ability to model complex joints and make and characterize functionally graded materials in general. The efforts will open up an almost entirely unexplored field related to the generalized preparation and study of FGAs by removing key barriers that currently prevent such investigations. They will also provide industry with new options that promise a significant advance in capabilities as far as bonding is concerned, leading to safer, stronger, lighter structures that make more efficient use of limited resources."

For example, environmental dust can shorten a jet engine's service life by 90 percent.  State-of-the-art experiments can only collect particle data in highly simplified systems.  A new technique is being developed that uses conventional medical Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems to make quantitative measurements of how particles are distributed in complex systems.  The data sets produced would have broad benefits for engineers, as well as for researchers studying environmental, biological, and fundamental physical systems.  A series of validation experiments will be carried out to complete development of the imaging technique and to establish its accuracy and limitations.  After the technique has been developed, two additional experiments will be performed to demonstrate broad societal benefits of the new measurements: one by assisting the design of more dust-resistant aircraft engines and the other by illuminating how inhaled dust or spray droplets move through the human nose.  Following the successful completion of this project, researchers would have a general method to aid in their understanding of any system where particles are carried by air or water currents.<br/><br/>Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be used to measure the concentration of microparticles quantitatively and in three dimensions.  The proposed work begins with a detailed set of validation experiments to test the range, resolution, and accuracy of the new experimental method across a range of flow conditions and particle concentrations.  Following the validation experiments, two application-relevant test cases will be employed as test beds for continued development of the technique. The first will explore the behavior of particles in an internal impingement cooling geometry frequently employed in aircraft turbine engine cooling systems.  In the second test case, particle concentration will be measured inside a model human nasal passage.  In addition to developing the technique, the test cases allow for new understanding of particle transport in two disparate fields of significant research interest.  The impact of the project has the potential to extend well past the scope of this proposal, as the technique could prove useful for computational model validation, fundamental particle-laden flow research, or a number of other research areas."

There is a significant need for nondestructive and quantitative microscopy in many biological investigations that this proposal addresses; that is, that sample preparation does not alter or deform the sample, that the details can be seen clearly and images captured with high resolution, and that the imaging process itself does not destroy the sample. Optical microscopes suffer from poor light penetration and low image resolution so sample preparation often requires slicing, fixing, staining and tagging methods that damage the samples. On the other hand, X-rays penetrate deeper in biomaterials and can image live, whole specimens nondestructively as is seen in medical applications. X-rays also have the advantage that there is minimal diffusion and scattering in biosamples, which can result in very high image resolution. However, current forms of absorption x-ray microscopy have poor contrast, low resolution and deliver high radiation doses to specimens. The proposed new generation of tomographic x-ray microscopes will provide quantitatively accurate, multi-parametric and high-resolution imaging data at low radiation dose; a first-generation prototype for a multimodality microscope will be tested during the project period. Engaging K-12 and undergraduate students in this type of interdisciplinary research will first require giving them the basic skills and knowledge for tackling problems that cross between physics, mathematics, engineering and biology. Students will be recruited from disadvantaged Houston-area school districts, and to retain their interest in STEM subjects a peer-mentoring program will be started, with special support provided for under-prepared segments of undergraduate students. To further motivate students to stick with STEM subjects organized summer camps will highlight interdisciplinary career opportunities and create research opportunities for undergraduates and high-school students. <br/><br/><br/>X-rays are of significantly higher frequency than visible light and thus offer the possibility of very high resolution and nondestructive microscopy. This project will develop methods to fully realize the potential of x-ray microscopes for bioscience applications. The project involves developing x-ray phase-contrast imaging using novel technology such as fast-pulsing x-ray tubes, photon-counting spectral detection schemes and algorithms to utilize the maximum information from each detected x-ray photons. The scientific goals of this proposal include theoretical methods, the design of a dose-efficient x-ray phase-contrast microscopy system on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, construction of the system, and the development of an additional multimodality microscope prototype. A range of biological problems will be investigated to test the benefits of the imaging system. The developed methods will be broadly disseminated and the initial prototypes will be made available to researchers working on an array of biological applications."

In the last two decades, graphs have been applied to virtually all parts of human activity such as health, literature, national defense, and urban planning.  The Internet and the information age in general increased significantly the amount of data that can be leveraged, and this has increased the size of the graphs being studied as well as the complexity of the analyses performed on them. Data analysts can not easily look into this kind of data as the current software and simple machines can not easily process the analysis and utilizing more powerful systems is often out of their skill set. Technically, the problem is that there is a wide variety of graphs to analyze (meshes of 3D objects, social networks, road networks to name a few) that have different properties in term of size, diameter, and connectivity. Even for a single problem, these differences cause differences in the algorithm that will solve the problem best; but the issue is magnified by the variety of analysis to perform. To make the matter worse, powerful workstations, accelerators, and clusters are different computing systems that are hard to leverage and could be relevant factors depending on which graph and which analysis is performed.<br/><br/>This project answers the question posed by application scientists `How to best solve MY computational graph problem?'. The purpose of the project is to gain a clear understanding of the performance of graph algorithms on different hardware architectures, to understand which modes of operation are preferable to use, to design new algorithms for the cases where no good solutions exists, and to design better algorithms for common use cases.  The project is based around a model-develop-experiment cycle to construct better algorithms geared at particular use cases. In particular it develops new algorithmic techniques to perform graph analysis by shortening critical paths, by leveraging vectorization, and by replicating data to improve load balance. Accurate modeling of the analyses is used to give insight on how to design better algorithms and to enable picking the best way to perform an analysis.  Software is designed to confirm the soundness of the performed work and to provide application experts with an efficient tool that does not require high performance computing expertise. <br/>The project provides software, algorithms, and models which increase productivity of data analysts by reducing the development burden on the analyst and by efficiently using computing systems to analyze graphs in a timely fashion.

Even after the impact of the acidic mine effluents are removed by treatment, the streambeds themselves will continue to release metals that are toxic to aquatic species.  The metal-containing sediments must be naturally removed in order for the stream to recover and allow both restoration of aquatic life and beneficial use by society.  The sediments consist primarily of very small nanoparticles of iron oxide that can contain As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. These small particles, which have stuck to the streambed, may be more quickly removed if they become more stable in water due to changes in the chemistry of their surfaces.  A treatment plant that removes the metals and acid from the mine effluents has just begun operation.  The treatment process also alters the composition of the stream water in such a way that the particles may become more stable in water and, thus, removed more quickly. This study will provide data that will lead to better estimates of how quickly other streams will recover if similar mine waste treatment is performed.  <br/><br/>Incidental nanoparticulate iron oxides (NP-FeOx) are formed in streams receiving acidic mine waters.  NP-FeOx is capable of transporting contaminant metals such as Cu, Zn, and As. In early 2017 a lime treatment plant will go online in the North Fork of Clear Creek (NFCC), which will dramatically alter the water chemistry of the stream.  The colloidal stability of NP-FeOX is dependent on solution composition (ionic strength, divalent cations, pH, DOC) and is thus likely to be affected.  The project goal is to understand how the removal of metals will be influenced by changes in the stability of the NP-FeOx.  In order to determine the immediate impact of the water treatment plant (WTP) on NP-FeOx stability in the water column, the dispersion of existing NP-FeOx contained in the streambed will be studied using spICP-MS, DLS, zeta potential, and ICP-OES. It is expected that preexisting NP-FeOX will disperse from the creek bed into the water during early WTP operation, which may result in a temporary increase in toxic metal concentrations.  This will be of long-term benefit, as this process may accelerate the restoration of the streambed.  This is the first time that nanoparticle stability under variable water chemistry conditions has been examined in an actual stream setting.  Additionally, the manipulation of pH and hardness in laboratory experiments will allow us to understand the effects of isolated water chemistry variables on particle dispersion in an AMD system.  A summer field session aimed at local high school students and college seniors at the Colorado School of Mines will participate in a field session at the study site. In addition, a partnership with the Upper Clear Creek Watershed Foundation will be forged to involve community volunteers on the proposed project."

In particular, it evaluates the notion that political strategies that invoke threat serve to increase political participation among the affected audience.  Previous work suggests that messages invoking fear lead to a increased attention to politics, thereby increasing the likelihood of participation. In this project, the PI argues that relying on strategies focusing only on fear or threat might actually lead to lower levels of participation by activating feelings of despair. This research investigates the possibility that messages which combine threats along with messages that encourage enthusiasm might be a more effective and encourage increased participation.   Given findings that indicate strong public support for policies that deny rights to others, especially in times of crisis, it is important to assess how specific message strategies can influence citizen participation, especially as the electorate becomes more diverse.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Conventional wisdom posits that political participation is often facilitated by messages of threats.  This research extends that work, arguing that appeals based primarily on crises may actually be counter-productive to political mobilization. Previous work finds that fear appeals were unsuccessful in the absence of an effective alternative to the threat. This research will study the corresponding effect on political mobilization by including alternative positive messages along with threat messages.  The PI argues that a message strategy combining threat and opportunity cues can lead to a greater sense of political efficacy among individuals. Focusing on immigration policy, the PI will assess the attitudinal effects of different messaging strategies by administering two survey experiments, and by analyzing Latino-only survey responses from the American National Election Study.  The PI expects that a message combining elements of threat and opportunity is a significant catalyst for increased political participation, especially among women.  This research provides indicates strong support for the proposition that more balanced political messages are at least as successful at motivating participation among an under-represented group in American politics."

In developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and India, the combination of rapid population growth and declining agricultural production is a major threat to food security, and hence to political stability. There is thus an urgent need to improve the immune system of plants so that they can defend themselves against disease.  This project is focused on understanding an underappreciated component of the plant immune system that appears to be shared with humans, extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are microscopic spherical packages that can carry information from one cell to another within an organism.  Recent work in animal systems, including humans, has revealed that this information can reprogram recipient cells so that the receiving cell changes the proteins it produces, and hence the properties of the cell, and in some cases, the ability of a cell to prevent infection by a virus.  Recent work in the Innes laboratory indicates that EVs may serve a similar role in plants.   This research project aims to address basic questions about how plant EVs are produced, what they carry, and how they may contribute to plant immunity. The answers to these questions will facilitate development of disease resistant crops.  In addition, this project will provide hands on plant science activities to elementary, high school and undergraduate students, with a special focus on underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the genesis and roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the context of plant immune systems.  Although EV release by plant cells is known to be stimulated by fungal and bacterial infection, nothing is known about their function. Over the last two years, the Innes laboratory has developed a method for purifying and quantifying EVs from Arabidopsis leaves. Analysis of purified EVs revealed that they carry microRNAs and are highly enriched in proteins associated with response to biotic and abiotic stress, suggesting that EVs may participate in intercellular communication.   The experiments described in this proposal will address the following questions: 1) Does the protein and RNA content of plant EVs change in response to specific biotic stresses?  2) Are known endomembrane trafficking proteins required for production of plant EVs? 3) Are EVs required for host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) of genes in a fungal pathogen? Question 1 will be addressed using proteomic and RNA-seq analysis of EVs purified from Arabidopsis leaves following treatment with various biotic stresses. Question 2 will be addressed by quantifying EV production in mutant Arabidopsis lines deficient in specific endomembrane trafficking proteins. Question 3 will be addressed using a forward genetics screen to identify Arabidopsis mutants that are unable to perform HIGS of genes in the fungus Fusarium graminearum. This screen will uncover Arabidopsis genes required for HIGS, and will establish whether EVs transport small RNAs from the host to the pathogen. This award is co-funded by the Plant Biotic Interactions program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems division and the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences division."

In particular, it seeks to establish whether the choices in politicians' presentation of self can lead to changes in the behaviors and attitudes of black voters. Despite the well-established findings about representation and black political leadership, little has been done to investigate how black voters' perceptions of black politicians may change depending on the types of political messages adopted by these politicians. This study utilizes original experimental data to identify why some black politicians gain more support than others from black voters. The research is of particular importance because it allows us to assess the political responses of black voters as some black politicians become more professionalized and employ a greater variety of means to appeal to voters.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project's aim is to bridge the study of black political leadership with that of descriptive representation to identify the causal mechanisms that produce the particularly high levels of in-group candidate support generally observed among black Americans. It seeks to show when and how varying content of the messages of black political leaders might lead to variation in candidate support among black voters. This study employs two original experimental tests that enhance our understanding of how perceptions of a candidate's connection and commitment to political inclusion of the black community might lead to changes in mass political behavior among black voters. The experimental research design allows the PI to isolate the causal mechanism at work, thereby providing greater explanatory power about how differences within black political leadership and displays of community commitment can change the political behavior and attitudes of black voters.  Furthermore, it will also allow greater insight into how black representatives are evaluated by black constituents."

Such professionalization is crucial on several fronts. Younger scholars will be teaching at major research universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges; curating museum exhibits; working at research institutes; overseeing library collections; and helping with government programs. Grants to independent scholars will allow them to maintain contact with their professional societies, creating intellectual and practical stimulation as they continue to work in museums, research institutes, libraries, and government agencies. Finally, recent PhDs, who face severe cuts in departmental travel funds, will have the opportunity to maintain their career trajectories. All of these groups advance the core mission of the NSF by improving science literacy and by elaborating on the nature of science and technology.

It will look at how being a member of a specific Community of Practice (CoP) influences teacher identity, belief in their personal teaching abilities, and desire to remain in the profession related to teacher retention. The institutions (SUNY at Stony Brook University, University of Kentucky, Kennesaw State University, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis) in this study span the U.S. and represent successful Noyce teacher preparation programs with a variety of recruitment strategies (e.g., career changers), induction support structures (e.g., online), and teacher placements (e.g., rural vs. urban). These six sites will also allow for a comparison of Noyce and non-Noyce teachers emerging from the different teacher preparation programs.  The goal is to determine whether a core set of program features contributes to the success of each induction program, or if distinct program features are useful for unique populations (e.g., periodic face-to-face meetings for career changers, or online support for urban teachers). The project also seeks to determine which program features lead to different community structures (e.g., collaborating mainly with teachers inside or outside the school), and how that community affects a teacher's perception of the profession (e.g., teacher is connected to professionals across the state and wants to remain in the profession as a career). The primary research methodology used in this research study is Social Network Analysis, which will be used to determine with whom teachers exchange information related to their teaching. The study will benefit the field by highlighting induction strategies appropriate and effective for diverse teacher groups, and lead to a desire for increased retention in the workforce. The study will inform workforce issues in the organizational sciences, in which limited work has explicitly adopted a social network approach to explain human resource outcomes.<br/><br/>The theory being examined in this project is the extent to which teacher identify formation linked to persistence in the profession can be detected in participants' social networks and correlated to Noyce preparation and induction features.  The three-stage research design will include documenting the antecedents of network formation, teacher networks, and the outcomes of networks. In Stage I, information will be collected about the support structures present at each site, and which activities and demographics represent the participants' experiences during induction. Coherence between the planned focus of each program, and the experiences of the participants, will be examined. In Stage II, social network information will be collected from participants using an ego-centric network survey (with data focused on a given teacher's local community of ties, e.g. the CoP) of who each teacher exchanges information with related to teaching content and pedagogy, how frequently the interactions occur, and whether the contacts occur in the local school or across regional, state, or national levels. Survey data will be transformed into matrices needed to generate STEM teacher networks, and examined for size, density, strength of ties, and geographic proximity to the teacher, utilizing the latest social network analysis software packages. Network properties from Stage II will be modeled using Stage I data to determine which activities and support structures contribute to different structural CoPs. In Stage III, teacher perceptions of their teaching self-efficacy, identity within the profession, and outlook on remaining in the profession will be collected. Stage III data will be modeled using Stage II network data to determine which CoPs influence desirable teacher outcomes. In order to strengthen claims of causality from the quantitative analyses, teachers will be asked which activities influence their CoP network, and which portions of the network effect their outcomes. Stage I and III instruments will be aligned to NSF Annual Participant Surveys, and Department of Education Teacher Follow-up Surveys, respectively, so results from this study may be generalized to national data in future studies."

GTPases are molecular on/off switches that control normal cell function and many aspects of health and disease. Current technology only measures the activity of a single GTPase at a time and is labor intensive. High costs further hinder routine laboratory or clinical analyses. A new technology for rapid and sensitive measurements of multiple GTPases in cells or tissues can revolutionize diagnostics and patient response to therapy. Potential commercial clients for the technology include clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and diagnostic kit manufacturers. Clients will be able to distinguish life-threatening conditions that require different treatments or determine drug treatment efficacy within hours instead of days. A 4- to 10-fold lower cost of sample analysis is an added potential benefit.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercialize potential of a new technology and make it broadly available for scientific discovery and clinical applications. The project further develops a technology that measures changes in cell or tissue GTPase enzyme function. Individual GTPases turn on and off in response to external cues that include microbes, disease, drugs and toxins. Coated beads capture active GTPases present in cells or body fluids. A common clinical laboratory instrument, called a flow cytometer, measures captured proteins on the beads. The technology enables drug discovery, diagnostics, and molecular discovery. A numerical readout makes it easy to monitor changes in GTPase activities due to experimental treatments over time and in small samples. Rapid screening of medications that can block disease processes speeds drug discovery. Bringing these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve discovery output in academia and industry."

In both the U.S. and in developing countries, many social programs are predicated on the idea of surplus labor; yet there has not been an empirical test of its existence.  The research will use field experiments which involve creating many industry jobs in a nearby city to test the labor surplus theory in a rural setting.  If rural workers can be absorbed into these factory jobs without any change in the wage or employment levels in the rural labor market, then this will demonstrate the existence of surplus labor. A pilot study of 36 local labor markets provides initial support for the existence of labor surplus in low income communities.  The results of this research will provide a better explanation of the functioning of labor markets in low income and high unemployment communities, and therefore provide guidance on crafting policies to reduce unemployment or to combat the effects of such high unemployment rates.  In addition, by revealing which types of self-employed small entrepreneurs would prefer wage work, the findings have implications for how to better target programs to enable small business growth in high unemployment settings. The results will be central to understanding many issues in development economics and will have applications in several fields of economics, such as labor economics, public economics, and industrial policy.  By improving the functioning of the U.S. labor market, the results thus improve U.S. competitiveness.  <br/><br/>This research project uses field experiments to obtain revealed preference estimates of labor rationing in rural labor markets, using rural labor markets in India as the test bed.  A large labor demand shock will be created by recruiting up to about 30 percent of workers in surrounding villages to work in nearby factory jobs.  If the amount of labor rationing is at least as big as the demand shock, then there will be: (i) no effect on local village level wages, (ii) no change in local village employment, and (iii) positive employment spillovers on workers who do not receive factory jobs.  In addition, a supplementary experiment will be conducted to estimate the short run elasticity of supply of labor, in order to check whether labor supply is perfectly elastic.  Examination of who benefits from unemployment spillovers can be used to explain the two possible components of labor rationing---voluntary unemployment and disguised unemployment.  Finally, comparing traditional survey-based measures of unemployment to these revealed preference estimates can help provide some validation of the reliability of traditional survey measures. The results of this research provide strong microeconomic foundations of labor market rationing and provide guidance for labor market policies in both low income and developed countries."

The emphasis is on enumerative and random aspects in the topology of real algebraic varieties. The main goal of the meeting is to facilitate discussions and collaborations in a focused setting, between researchers mostly in Northern America but also in France. The small size of the workshop provides an ideal environment for graduate students and young researchers to interact with experts in the field. <br/><br/>The field of real algebraic geometry, and in particular the study of the topology of real algebraic varieties, employs a wide variety of techniques, ranging from symplectic geometry, tropical geometry, as well as more traditional tools such as complex algebraic geometry, topology of manifolds and transformation groups. In the recent years we have witnessed spectacular developments stemming from symplectic geometry, complex analysis and probability. This workshop brings together researchers from many of these areas, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its participants. In particular, the presentations will be devoted to the recent progress in the enumerative geometry of real algebraic varieties (Georgieva, Niu, Tukachinsky), a probabilistic approach to real enumerative geometry (Basu, Lundberg) and to new directions in the study of real algebraic manifolds (Gabrielov, Sottile).<br/><br/>For more details, see the webpage of the workshop:  https://my.vanderbilt.edu/ragworkshop/ ."

Data will be collected in both the lab and classroom, using a diverse sample of high school and college students from three sites across the U.S. The team will integrate data from a range of sources including modeling of small group problem solving and collaborative learning and from the modeling of low-level data from eye tracking, facial feature tracking, psychophysiology, and linguistic/paralinguistic speech analysis. Additionally, the team will study the moderating effects of task constraints and group composition on CPS processes and outcomes. A further goal is to model dynamic CPS processes using nonlinear time series analyses and multimodal deep recurrent neural networks. The computational models will be integrated into the learning environment to test the hypothesis that CPS outcomes can be improved by providing automated feedback on unfolding collaborative processes. Thus, by blending basic experimental research, multisensor-multimodal analysis, computational modeling, and dynamic computerized intervention, the researchers will attempt to make foundational theoretical, methodological, and technological advances."

In practice, this does not happen either in the developed world or developing world.  The inability of labor markets to automatically adjust to high unemployment rates may be one of the reasons why small fluctuations in economic activity lead to serious depressions.

To become legally binding, almost all high-cost regulations must pass a ""cost-benefit test"": the monetized value of the harms averted by the rule exceeds costs to regulated industries and consumers. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been controversial in its monetary translation of life-saving benefits and how to estimate risks with incomplete data, but ironically, the mechanics of how to quantify effects of both risk reduction and cost on human welfare has received less attention. This project presumes that two changes to current methods of benefit and cost valuation might change which regulations pass or fail the cost-benefit test, and alter the optimal level of stringency for a given regulation. First, typical estimates of the value of a statistical life deliberately exclude all consideration of altruism, using the estimated private value of reducing a small risk of one's own death to value public programs benefiting the entire nation. Secondly, CBA implicitly dictates that the total benefit of a program is proportional to the number of lives saved, regardless of whether some people face much higher mortality risks, and CBA also considers only the regulation's total cost, even if costs affect some businesses or consumers disproportionately.<br/><br/>Two large survey experiments probe these simplified assumptions and offer principled, quantitative alternatives. The researchers estimate the ""value of a statistical life with shared purpose"" by querying subjects on the perceived desirability of hypothetical regulations in which the scale of tradeoffs is billions of dollars imposed on everyone and thousands of randomly saved lives, not a personal tradeoff between a few dollars and a tiny fraction of one life. This survey also tests for (and isolates) the effects of: (1) ""paternalistic"" altruism (concern for others' longevity even if those others would prefer greater risk at less regulatory cost) versus ""non-paternalistic"" altruism (considering others' net benefits including their costs); and (2) posing tradeoffs as both a user-defined acceptable cost for a fixed number of lives saved and a user-defined minimum number of lives saved for a fixed regulatory cost.  A second survey tests the assumption that individual levels of risk and cost can be summed over the population without being disaggregated (i.e., that individuals regard the welfare effects of risk or cost at any level as linear), using subjects' ratings of how dire they view varying hypothetical individual probabilities of harm and varying personal costs. This experiment reveals whether there are de minimus levels of either risk or cost that can sensibly be rounded to zero, and/or intolerably high levels whose effects are not merely proportional to those at lower levels. The project also enlists practitioners and users of CBA in the federal government as a separate subject group for the two surveys, and culminates with two workshops for these officials to discuss research results and whether adding ""shared purpose"" and nonlinear valuation of risk and cost might have changed important prior decisions about which regulatory option in fact had the greatest net benefit to society."

Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life will include panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information is available at the conference website:<br/>https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/"

In response to this problem, the field of humanitarian ERW remediation seeks to detect, dispose, and even recycle ERW with the goal of rendering the ERW-contaminated land safe. Thus, these activities are of critical importance to the growth of affected nations and safety of their people. This international research experiences for students (IRES) program is focused on using mechatronics - a field which integrates mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, control systems engineering, and computer science - to develop solutions for the humanitarian ERW remediation community. This program, run from Villanova University (VU), will send 6 students - at least 2 of which will be graduate students - to do research in Cambodia, one of the most ERW contaminated countries in the world. These students will undertake a 10 week long summer program, including 7.5 weeks in-country. While in Cambodia, the students will collaborate with researchers affiliated with the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) - the premiere technical university in Cambodia - and the Golden West Humanitarian Foundation (GWHF) - one of the world leaders in humanitarian ERW remediation research and development. In addition to the main research goal of finding mechatronic solutions to problems in the humanitarian ERW remediation community, the program will also serve to 1) strengthen an existing VU-GWHF collaboration, 2) develop globally-engaged engineering researchers and 3) introduce future leaders in engineering research to humanitarian engineering issues. <br/><br/>The proposed research program will focus on difficult, real-world problems in the area of humanitarian ERW remediation. Projects will be jointly agreed upon by the researchers at VU, ITC, and GWHF. Potential projects include robotic non-technical and/or technical survey for area reduction, automated visual inspection of ordinance, and communications for explosive ordnance disposal (EOD). In general, the fundamental research in this project has the potential to impact mechatronics in a number of ways, including advancements to novel robotics platforms, advanced control and search algorithms, new sensors and sensing strategies, swarm robotics algorithms, and communications."

Despite this significance, there is relatively little evidence regarding how individuals cause others to participate in cooperative ventures. This study analyzes cell phone data: the time and location of sent/received text messages and calls.  The analysis tells us how individuals cause their peers to join in collective action; how this might encourage broader cooperative behavior; and how these processes differ from that of non-collective action areas.  Additionally, this research introduces the field to cell phone metadata -- an exceptionally rich data source that can help provide insight into a range of political and social behavior. In particular, it contributes to studies of how technologically-enabled communication affects economic and political behaviors, and situates the research within one of the NSF's Ten Big Ideas, studying work at the Human-Technology Frontier.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>In this proposal, the PI seeks to investigate the causal mechanisms that lead to successful collective action.  Prominent theories of collective action argue that individuals choose to participate in an instance of collective action based on two sets of factors: their own preferences and opportunity costs (independent from their peers) and/or on estimates of how many other people will participate, which is only marginally affected by peers' decisions. These approaches are contradicted by a growing empirical literature in behavioral economics, which finds strong evidence that individuals determine their immediate peers' economic choices in many other non-collective action domains. The PI contributes to this line of research in two important areas.  First, the project proposes to develop a large-scale empirical study of how individuals lead others to participate in collective action.  Second, the research will show how individual-level effects spread through communication networks, manifesting in widespread behaviors. This dissertation takes analyzes several country-years of anonymized cell phone metadata.  This data records individuals' communication with other individuals before and during instances of collective action as well as their geographic movement (i.e. call/SMS sender, recipient, timestamp, and location). Using this data, the PI exploits a series of natural experiments to assess (1) individuals' causal effects on their peers' participation in collective action; (2) how these individual causal effects aggregate into collective action; and (3) how these causal processes differ from individuals? causal effects on their peers? economic decisions in non-collective action domains."

The formation of ophiolites is a fundamental component of plate tectonics, potentially related to the initiation of new subduction zones. Recent application of high-precision U-Pb dating has advanced our understanding of the formation and emplacement of the Semail (Oman-United Arab Emirates) ophiolite, the largest and best studied ophiolite in the world. This project will expand on the recent work, undertaking detailed high-precision dating of metamorphic rocks persevered below the ophiolite, which likely formed at depths greater than 35 km within a subduction zone. The results will address long-standing debates regarding the origin of ophiolites, and provide new insight into how ophiolites can be used to understand modern mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones, and potentially the initiation of subduction, a critical but poorly understood tectonic process. The research will advance desired societal outcomes by graduate student training in the earth sciences, involvement of Omani students, public outreach, and fostering collaborations between scientists from the United States, the United Kingdom, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.<br/><br/>A thin sole of amphibolite- to granulite-facies metamorphic rocks underlies the Semail and other Tethyan ophiolites. As preserved remnants of the underthrust plate, sole exposures can be used to better understand the formation and obduction of ophiolites. Recent data from two large exposures of the metamorphic sole below the Semail ophiolite yielded surprising results, indicating that that the earliest sole metamorphism was synchronous with or pre-dated formation of the ophiolite crust and that metamorphism was diachronous along the length of the ophiolite, spanning 1.3 Ma, contrary to current models. These data, combined with existing geochemical constraints and the estimated metamorphic pressures from the sole, are best explained by formation of the ophiolite in a supra-subduction zone setting, with metamorphism of the sole rocks occurring in a subducted slab. To better understand the implications of these results to the origin of ophiolites, the project scientists will carry out high-precision isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon dating at exposures of the metamorphic sole throughout the Semail ophiolite. The new dataset from the sole of the ophiolite has the potential to provide transformative insight into the formation and emplacement of ophiolites, and to processes of subduction and exhumation at convergent margins."

The project is designed to meet regional and state needs for more highly-qualified and well-prepared teachers by providing a model that encourages recent STEM graduates and STEM professionals to bring their knowledge and life experiences into the classroom for the benefit of future generations of students. Through the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, STEMteach will offer stipends to cover the majority of the cost of the program for seventy (70) future teachers who commit to teaching for two years in a high-needs district. Through a partnership with nearby Century College, a 2-year college, the program seeks to make teaching attractive and attainable for low-income and first generation college students as well as those underrepresented in STEM and STEM teaching. The grant will support early recruitment activities using 55 summer internships for STEM pre-major students from Century College, the largest source of transfer students to UWRF.  Century College students benefit from this partnership through career readiness skill development (resume drafting, interview practice, and career exploration) as they apply for teaching internships related to computer science, engineering, and STEM education. Some of these interns may be able to transfer into a traditional undergraduate teacher preparation program, while others may find it advantageous to complete their STEM degree and then obtain their teacher preparation via the STEMteach program, or similar programs.<br/><br/>STEMteach is a minimum 30 credit hour UTeach-inspired program that is designed to provide rigorous and efficient STEM-infused pedagogy for recent graduates and career changers, including veterans.  It is an innovative graduate teaching certification program with three optional pathways for completing a Master's degree in education.  In order to provide the preparation and field experiences deemed necessary for success in the classroom, candidates are counseled to ""give up your day job.""  Through Noyce Scholar stipends, the financial burden associated with this requirement is lessened.   The inquiry-based and STEM-infused program provides challenging graduate coursework and extensive field preparation.  This promotes an understanding and synthesis of theory and practice, as well as a deep understanding of the challenges and rewards associated with teaching in diverse environments: urban/rural/suburban, high-needs/high performing schools, traditional, informal, and summer enrichment/summer remediation.  STEMteach is centered around intentional and well-supported field experiences which utilize co-teaching. Early and intensive field experiences begin in the first course and continue throughout the program, culminating with apprentice teaching.  Instruction occurs on the UWRF campus as well as in partner high-need school districts.  This project will also provide funding of a Mathematics Master Teacher who will work in partnership with the UWRF existing Science Master teacher, recruiting 2-year College STEM students into internships, and increasing efforts to integrate computer science and computational thinking into the curriculum.   Two types of internships will be offered; both are designed to give students a ""taste of teaching:"" 1) a two-week internship working with a UWRF-based STEM camp to gain experience with young students and 2) an internship to work directly with the STEMteach Master Teachers for 15 hours per week for 8 weeks in the day-to-day teaching activities of the STEMteach program."

Limb regeneration does not occur if nerve fibers (axons) that normally connect with the limb are absent. The objective of this award is to elucidate the crucial-yet-poorly-understood relationship between limb regeneration and nerves. It has traditionally been thought that the role of nerves is to promote the multiplication (proliferation) of cells located at the injury site. The hypothesis of this proposal is that, while nerves tell cells to proliferate, the absence of nerves causes an increase in molecules that stop the limb from regenerating. Novel genetic approaches in the Mexican Axolotl salamander will be used to study these anti-regenerative molecules. In addition to presenting technical advantages for these studies, Axolotls are exceptionally charismatic animals that exhibit powerful regeneration responses; they are excellent for integrating teaching and research in the laboratory and classroom. Understanding the basis of nerve-limb interactions during regeneration would have a major impact on our understanding of animal regeneration, and may shape novel approaches for regenerative medicine. This project also aims to ignite interest in axolotls and regeneration, and to recruit promising future scientists into the field. This will be carried out by developing programs introducing axolotls and regeneration to local YMCA summer camps, including significant undergraduate and graduate research training, integrating research from this project into an undergraduate course on regeneration, and participating in diversity-focused training programs that center on regeneration.<br/><br/>Axotomy of the nerve bundles that innervate a regenerating salamander limb completely blocks regeneration. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) has recently been implicated as a mitogenic factor emanating from nerve axons during axolotl salamander limb regeneration, but a mechanistic explanation for why NRG1 is required is lacking. This proposal will test the hypothesis that regenerating limbs with insufficient axon-derived NRG1 ligands will not regenerate due to a lack of positive mitogenic signaling as well as an increase in a peripheral nerve (Schwann cells)-derived inhibitory signals, creating a non-permissive environment. Testing the hypothesis that axons play a multifaceted role during regeneration will transform our understanding of how regeneration is regulated. Aim 1 will test the requirement of axon-derived NRG1 by studying the effects of neuron-specific morpholino knockdown and spatially controlled CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation. To test for the sufficiency of NRG1 signaling to support regeneration in the absence of axons, a secreted form of NRG1 and a constitutively active form of its receptor will be overexpressed in axotomized and amputated limbs. Aim 2 will utilize RNA sequencing to identify signaling nodes that are specifically affected by NRG1 inhibition. Aim 3 will investigate the permissive nature of axons through the study of molecules secreted from axotomized peripheral nerve bundles using gain- and loss-of-function experiments for candidate inhibitory molecules. The findings made from the proposed experiments will increase understanding of the mechanisms promoting limb regeneration and a major technological advance in our ability to test gene function during regeneration."

It is important to make solar panels as efficient as possible so that the number of panels needed to obtain a certain amount of power can be reduced in order to save on installation costs. Tandem cells, comprised of a top cell that harvests the visible portion of the spectrum and a bottom cell that harvests the infrared portion, are the most promising way to achieve higher efficiencies. Silicon, which is used in approximately 92% of the solar panels that are manufactured each year, is ideal for the bottom cell and typically has 16-21 % efficiency by itself. Perovskite semiconductors are highly attractive for the top cell because they can be tuned to have the right bandgap and have efficiency as high as 22%. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the first 30%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project describes plans for a perovskite expert, Professor Michael McGehee, to partner with a silicon expert, Professor Zachary Holman, to make perovskites/silicon tandem solar cells. This team has made a prototype two-terminal monolithic device with a power conversion efficiency of 25.3 %. They hold the world record for this type of device and are in a very strong position to increase the efficiency to 30% over the next two years. This development is especially exciting because their packaged perovskite solar cells have already passed the PV industry standard damp heat and temperature cycling tests and it is likely that panels with these cells could be manufactured at a cost of < $100/m2. The bandgap of perovskites can be tuned from 1.2 eV to 2.3 eV using the materials set ABX3, where A is a mixture of methylammonium, formamidinium or cesium, B is a mixture of tin and lead, and X is a mixture of bromine or iodine. The most important research goal of this project is to find the optimal combination of these components for making a stable and high-quality semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The team will thoroughly characterize the semiconductors it makes to guide the process of optimizing the properties. Additional research goals of this project are to develop high-mobility TCO layers for the front of the tandem solar cells, improve the infrared response of the silicon bottom cell while decreasing its cost via a porous dielectric/metal rear reflector, and fabricate PDMS layers with scattering textures to be used at the front of the tandem to reduce reflectance.<br/>This project has the potential to change our future energy landscape through the development of efficient yet inexpensive PV technologies. The project will also train a diverse pool of students and the results will be disseminated broadly. Holman is the PI of an NSF REU site into which the proposed project will be integrated. Approximately once every 18 months McGehee gives a lecture that is intended to be easy to understand even for people who are not yet scientists and posts it on YouTube.  These lectures are typically viewed more than 20,000 times by a wide variety of people."

With the development of a sequencing-based technology for measuring the rate of messenger RNA translation, it becomes clear that defense protein synthesis is tightly regulated in plants. This project aims to understand how this regulation is carried out and to identify messenger RNA features and important molecules involved in this regulation. The success of this project will not only fill a gap in the knowledge of the plant immune mechanisms, but also revolutionize strategies of engineering disease resistant crops by more precisely control defense proteins production. This new strategy will enable engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance without compromising plant fitness, leading to reduced use of pesticides and lightening of selective pressure for resistant pathogens. This project will also result in training of scientists from high school students to postdoctoral researchers in performing frontier research. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the translational regulatory mechanisms of plant immune responses. Studies of TBF1, a key plant immune transcription factor (TF), showed that its translation is controlled by two upstream open reading frames (uORFs). These uORFs normally block ribosomes from reaching the major ORF. Upon immune induction, this inhibitory effect is rapidly alleviated, leading to TBF1 translation. This suggests that de-repressing translation of pre-existing immune TF mRNA may be a strategy for rapid response to pathogen challenge. Global translatome profiling using ribosome footprinting showed that during pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), changes in translation did not correlate well with transcription. Genes with altered translational efficiency (TE) during PTI belong to diverse functional groups and contain novel regulators of this immune response. Moreover, an mRNA consensus (uR-motif) was found to be significantly enriched in the 5' leader regions of transcripts with increased TE during PTI. This project aims to generate more translatome profiles and the first plant tRNAome datasets, essential for studying global translational changes during plant defense responses, and elucidate how tRNA level changes, mRNA sequence features (e.g., uORFs and R-motif), and trans-acting factors regulate translation. The project will lead to insight into how plants selectively translate defense-related proteins and identify new regulators of different immune responses. The project will also involve training of two postdoctoral researchers and enable continuation in outreach activities, including hosting lab tours for local high school and community college students, and mentoring for the SROP Program for minority undergraduate summer research."

While plants can protect themselves using a wide-array of defensive responses, they can also receive protection from the natural enemies of insect herbivores, including parasitoids and pathogens.

Parasitoids and baculoviruses occur in nature and are also used as biological control agents to control pest insects in agriculture. Knowledge gained from this project may have widespread impacts on informing sustainable pest management by improving the integration of biological control agents with the development of pest resistant crop plants.

While parasitoids (and their symbiotic polydnaviruses) and baculoviruses can manipulate the immune systems of their hosts, whether they can also alter the host's production of salivary HAMPs and effectors has never been investigated. The aims of this project are (1) to determine if parasitoids/polydnaviruses and baculoviruses modulate the synthesis and activity of caterpillar salivary HAMPs and effectors and (2) determine whether baculoviruses and parasitoids/polydnaviruses manipulate plant defenses to their own benefit. The third trophic level will consist of both specialists and generalists because it has been postulated that specialist natural enemies exert greater control over the physiology and behavior of their hosts than generalist species. Thus specialists may have a stronger influence on the expression of plant defenses. Molecular and biochemical assays and life-history measurements will be used to address the aims. In the Dawkin's model of the extended phenotype, whereby a gene in one organism has phenotypic effects on another organism, the potential of parasitoids and baculoviruses to exert control over not just their host's immune systems, but also control over the plant's immune system could represent one of the most extended phenotypes known."

This has been a central question in economics for nearly a century, and its answer has implications for the long term well-being of societies, and for how government policy can promote this well-being.  In this project we will study the most common firm type in the world:  the family-owned farm.  Our research focuses on farms in Africa, which employ a large share of the world?s poor.  A detailed understanding the productivity of these firms -- whether and why some firms are more productive than others ? will help provide the foundation for designing policy interventions that could improve their overall productivity, and thus lift incomes for many of the world's poorest.   Working with US satellite companies, we will also generate new estimates of agricultural productivity based on satellite imagery, and make these data available to both researchers and policymakers.  Results from this research has policy implications for increasing the productivity of small businesses and thus reduce poverty throughout the world, including in the U.S. <br/><br/>The goal of our proposed work is to characterize the size and sources of productivity dispersion across family owned farms, the most common firm type in the world and the employer of a majority of the world's poor.  Productivity dispersion has been well studied among firms in the developed world, but surprisingly little is known about the temporal and spatial patterns of productivity dispersion in poor countries.  Understanding the size and source of productivity gaps among agricultural firms -- previously difficult to study due to lack of data -- would fill a large gap in the existing productivity literature.  <br/><br/>We propose to make progress on this question by combining two newly-available sources of data:  a growing set of high-quality household panel surveys currently underway by the World Bank in multiple African countries, and brand-new high-resolution satellite-based estimates of land productivity in Eastern Africa.  These two data sources, in combination, will allow us to evaluate for agricultural firms the stylized facts that have been established for manufacturing and retail firms:  whether productivity dispersion across firms is large and persistent, whether firm entry and exit are correlated with productivity, and whether selective exit and entry are an important source of aggregate productivity growth within the agricultural sector.  Analysis will be conducted across nine African countries."

These crystals tend to grow rapidly, however, when exposed to cyclic external forces, limiting their practical utility as load-bearing structures. This award supports fundamental research to enable enhanced stability in nanocrystalline alloys and to uncover their behavior under cyclic loading conditions, by applying innovative alloy design and synthesis methods. Further, this project will develop a predictive framework which will identify suitable compositions of novel nanocrystalline alloys that will meet or exceed the performance of conventional alloys under cyclic loads, including rotating machinery and engine components critical to the transportation, defense and energy sectors. This interdisciplinary research will provide opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups, women, and persons with disabilities, and will directly raise public interest in science and engineering through creative outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>Metals with a mean grain size below 100 nm have inspired much research interest owing to their superior mechanical properties as compared to course-grained materials. However, despite the potential applicability of nanocrystalline alloys for load-bearing structures, very few studies have addressed the fundamental microstructural evolution under fatigue loads, specifically, grain size effects on fatigue processes. The critical gap in knowledge has stemmed from microstructural instability, i.e., grain growth and texture evolution observed during cyclic deformation. Motivated by this, the goals of this project are: (1) implementation of selective segregation of nanoclusters to lower the thermodynamic and kinetic driving forces for grain growth, and as a result, a clear understanding of the true microstructural grain size effects on salient fatigue growth mechanisms can be unraveled; and (2) to exploit the subsequent knowledge to reconcile key theories and hypotheses pertaining to fatigue crack growth behavior of nanocrystalline metals. The fatigue crack growth mechanisms as a function of grain size quantified in this project have broad scientific ramifications as this knowledge is highly relevant for designing and synthesizing nanocrystalline alloys with optimal microstructures, and for accurate predictive simulations."

SitC is developing a collection of new educational resources -- richly annotated versions of research articles from the journal *Science* -- along with methods and guides to help undergraduate STEM educators use these resources effectively in their classrooms. This approach uses leading-edge research both to teach STEM concepts and to excite students about the frontiers of science. Through the workshop, the SitC project team will provide a foundation for teaching the nature and practices of science, in the context of SitC resources, to college and university faculty, pre-service teachers, graduate students, postdocs, and other STEM professionals, and the workshop will allow the SitC project to leverage the expertise of the participants to develop educator guides for SitC resources. The workshop will have three primary benefits: (1) Participants will learn how to develop high-quality educator guides focusing on the nature of science and scientific practices, a skill that is useful for STEM education but is also transferable to a wide variety of STEM careers. (2) Through the new educator guides, which will be freely available on the Web, the workshop will increase the accessibility of annotated primary literature resources that have been vetted by educational experts. (3) Focusing on the nature and practices of science in a teaching context has been shown to contribute to the improvement of essential research skills. Therefore, participants in the workshop may improve their own research skills and become better scientists.<br/><br/>The project will encourage adoption of education research in the practice of teaching in the STEM disciplines. This adoption will take place at two levels. First, members of the undergraduate STEM education community will be provided a professional development opportunity in using primary literature to teach the nature and practices of science. Successful completion of the workshop should result in greater understanding of the benefits of teaching the nature and practices of science. Recent research has shown that when teaching in the context of inquiry-based thinking rooted in the nature of science, graduate students and postdocs reinforced their own learning and, by extension, became better researchers. Therefore, providing the undergraduate STEM education community with a foundation for teaching the nature and practices of science will also improve the quality of the research training and science careers participants are involved in. The second level of adoption will result from the educator guides that participants will produce as part of the workshop. These guides will accompany SitC resources and will be freely available to STEM educators via the Web."

This confidence in economic exchange is often affected by state institutions that possess the authority to enforce contracts which ensure agreements are not broken. In much of the world, however, weak state institutions limit the confidence of citizens and businesses that contracts and deals will be enforced fairly. As a result, economic exchange is stifled and inefficiencies persist.  Understanding how contracts and economic exchange are affected, particularly in contexts where only a subset of individuals enjoy privileged access to state institutions, is essential for development yet not well understood. This project will assess how varying levels political connectivity influences economic exchange.  The findings from this study will provide valuable insight as to how different strategies can spur economic development in areas where the rule of law is not evenly distributed among citizens.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This project consists of a conjoint experiment among firm leaders, as well as an innovative field experiment to assess how varying degrees of connectedness influences economic exchange in weak states.  Building off existing work on political networks, contracting, and economic exchange in a weak state, this conjoint experiment will help to identify the characteristics of potential business partners that matter most to firms in developing economies. The randomized control trial (RCT) will test how political connections affect change in realistic contexts, by randomly varying signals of connections between the two parties engaged in exchange, and observing how these signals serve to shape the contracts and deals that result. The findings will be among the first causal estimates of the impact of political connections on economic exchange."

The semiconductor industry provides vital hardware backbone of the information technology age through an extremely wide range of integrated circuits (ICs) in computing devices and consumer electronics.  Modern IC development process is bottlenecked by growing chip design complexity, e.g. measured by large device count and functionality diversity, and ever-demanding requirements on computing performance and power/energy efficiency. Advanced IC manufacturing processes are costly, and yet have unavoidable process variations, making fabricated chips susceptible to failures. With its revenue reaching $7.8 billion in 2015, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry supplies indispensable tools and methodologies that make IC design possible. The potential market and societal impact of the proposed EDA innovation is substantial. This technology can help semiconductor and chip design companies develop integrated circuits of improved performance and robustness with a reduced time-to-market and development cost.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project demonstrates novel machine learning algorithms targeting electronic design automation. As the complexity of integrated circuits scales up rapidly, the need for smart design tools is prominent. The EDA industry is in the early phase of rapid integration of machine learning algorithms into commercial IC design flows. The learning methods focused in this project significantly improve the accuracy of statistical regression and classification over the current-state-of-the-art, and offer the much needed understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Built upon the focused machine learning algorithms, the targeted EDA technology can efficiently process simulation or measured performance data of existing chip designs, and intelligently learn the complex hidden relationships between performance specifications, design parameters, and manufacturing conditions. As a result, it offers a powerful data science solution to IC design optimization, verification, and debug.   Implemented as high-performance parallel software design tools, the technology will bring the power of machine learning to the field of electronic design."

This research seeks to investigate the question of whether computer graphics techniques can help expert mathematicians and general public to visualize and communicate the higher-dimensional mathematical objects and their deformations. The ultimate goal of this research is to establish a mechanism by which an expert human viewer can manipulate a higher-dimensional geometric object that they can only see in part, i.e., via a slice or projection into two or three dimensions. Theoretical contributions of this research will impact and improve methods in mathematical visualization, particularly graph visualization, computer aided design, and large-scale spatial visualization, while the project deliverables will have direct and transformative impact on the ability of mathematicians to study higher-dimensional objects, and to communicate what they have learned in person, in presentations, and in archival works. The success of this project will ultimately translate into more rapid advancement in areas of pure and applied mathematics where higher dimensional geometry plays an important role, and provide mathematical visualization tool sets to facilitate college and K-12 students in their geometry courses. The project will make research outcomes including open source software freely available, and will disseminate mathematical sciences to the general public by rendering and presenting pedagogical animations at the University of Louisville Planetarium. The project also includes integrated educational and outreach activities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>The research will explore an interactive visualization paradigm that makes use of energy-driven self-deformable object models embedded in higher dimensions, supplemented by reduced-dimensional analogies for expert human viewers to guide the deformations towards their final goals. The investigators will begin by assigning a deformation energy to the higher-dimensional object, so that the aspects of the configuration that are unseen and unfamiliar can be controlled in a principled and well-posed manner by constraints or manipulations on the aspects of the configuration that are seen and familiar in our dimensions. Often times mathematical simulations are concerned with heavily vectorized operations performed over and over in a large number of iterations. The project will exploit hardware-enabled parallelism to accelerate mathematical simulations, and to extract key moments where successive terms differ by one critical change to represent and analyze various mathematical evolutions. By combining guided relaxation method and accelerated computation, this research can potentially make a novel contribution to building intuition about classes of geometric and topological problems that otherwise would be nearly impossible to communicate, perceptualize, and disseminate; and can potentially further the entire concept of the assistance and empowerment of human understanding by computer methods, specifically via the power of visual and computational spatial visualization tools.

The work seeks to determine whether these individuals exhibit increased trust of the state and therefore increase their political participation, or, alternatively, find that these individuals disengage from the state. This study seeks to understand whether the formal recognition of a right -- in particular, a formal property right to land -- affects an individual's incentives to engage in politics. The researcher conducts a cross-national analysis of three rural land-titling programs. These titling policies offer a unique opportunity to study how an often marginalized group, small-holding farmers, react when the state formally grants them a legal property right. This study is poised to make a meaningful contribution to political science and legal literature, which have long recognized the potential of legal rights to legitimize the state or spark political mobilization, but which have not explored the relationship between the formal recognition of rights and the corresponding influence on political attitudes and behavior. This project will also help to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed land formalization efforts, distinguish meaningful extensions of rights from ineffective ones. Additionally, the study can also provide evidence on whether the recognition of victims' rights can promote reconstruction and build trust toward state institutions in the aftermath of armed conflict.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>In this project, the research investigates whether the extension of a formal, legal right causes an individual to trust in and/or engage more with the state. This study seeks to understand whether the formal recognition of a right, in particular, a formal property right to land, changes an individual's incentives to engage in politics. Despite the centrality of legal rights in normative and social movement theories, two significant questions remain unresolved. First, does a legal right itself, as a symbolic justification of a claim, have an effect on political behavior beyond the underlying endowment or entitlement the right protects? Secondly, do rights create an incentive to participate disengage politically?  Scholars debate the power of rights-based claims to promote political mobilization and to engender political change. Indeed, if receiving a formal right increases the right-bearer's feeling of security over an interest, there may be little incentive to engage in 'costly' political activities. However, others argue that rights are powerful symbols, and question why they incentivize mobilization in some instances, but dampen participation in others.  This project uses a multi-method, cross-national research design that combines qualitative and statistical data and analyses from three rural land-titling programs. These programs provide an opportunity to study a specific change in legal status, yet does not significantly alter the underlying distribution of land, thereby isolating the impact of the change in legal rights.  This funding will sponsor the field research data collection through focus groups and small-holding farmers in rural villages. These new data will help to interpret the results from statistical analyses on land formalization.  Notably they will provide important insight into the causal mechanisms that underlie any effect associated with changes in the status of rights recognition. In turn, this will contribute to the study's impact on our theoretical and empirical understanding of the influence of rights on individual behavior."

There are numerous methods for producing hydrogels, however many of these methods are strongly dependent on chemical composition and or chemical reactions. This award supports the development of a novel family of hydrogel materials produced from long and flexible fibers using a mechanical approach that does not rely on chemical reactions. This phenomenon, where flowing a suspension of microfibers causes the fibers to knot and entangle into a continuous network, is a largely unexplored field but has the potential to contribute significantly to the scientific, engineering, healthcare and industrial communities as it offers a simple and novel alternative route to engineering porous hydrogels with well-controlled properties. This study requires a multidisciplinary effort drawing upon concepts from materials science, flow processing, fluid mechanics, chemistry and bioengineering. The multidisciplinary nature of the research program will provide a rich learning experience for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The primary research objectives of this project are focused on building a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of gelation of microfibers and the resultant properties of the fiber-based hydrogels when subjected to various flow conditions, thus establishing the structure-property relationships of flow-produced fiber-based hydrogels. These relationships will guide the design and processing parameters for producing fiber-based hydrogels for target applications, such as tissue engineering and surgical adhesives. This research involves both experimental and computational approaches to optimize the design and production of fiber-based hydrogels from flow processing. The experimental component of this project involves microfluidic approaches for fiber synthesis, rheological characterization of fiber suspensions and hydrogels, and imaging analysis of hydrogel microstructure. The computational component focuses on numerical simulation methods to model fiber knotting and entanglements when the suspended fibers are subjected to diverse stress conditions. In addition, the research can contribute meaningful insights to the existing body of literature on the flow properties of suspensions of long and slender objects, which is a very important theme in many industrial processes. Another significant outcome is the development of a unique paradigm for injectable hydrogels that utilizes micron-sized building blocks in a process that is entirely mechanical as the suspension gels in situ during injection without chemical reactions."

The ubiquitous computing nature of IoT enables continuous monitoring and management of all healthcare vitals. However, these real-time mission-critical IoT applications demand both a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE), as well as personalization for individual health care contexts. Additionally, there is a need for long-lasting battery-powered wireless sensors, reliable network connectivity, and cloud services. This project aims to solve these challenges via personalization and holistic coupling of the IoT infrastructure and the services provided to end users. The approach utilizes a novel self-aware cognitive architecture that delivers efficient and customized services by learning from end user behavior and adapting the IoT infrastructure to a person's current state, daily life routine, and environment. The project's exemplar application - efficient early detection of life-threatening signs - can potentially save lives through better quality of care, and timely delivery of critical/urgent health indicators. While the project will be validated in the healthcare domain, the project's framework and services are applicable to a broad range of other IoT application domains. The international collaborative nature of this project will enrich the learning experience of students and researchers by exposing them to the challenges of developing IoT services for delivering life-critical services in the healthcare domain.<br/><br/>Quality of Experience (QoE) is a key metric for successful delivery of end-user services for IoT-enabled applications. Achieving consistent end-user QoE poses tremendous challenges in the face of resource constraints and dynamic variations at multiple scales of the IoT system stack: at the application, network, resource, and device levels. Personalization - through holistic coupling of both the IoT infrastructure, as well as end-user services - provides a key opportunity to manage and exploit these variations and deliver customized QoE under resource constraints. This proposal outlines a self-aware Internet of Cognitive Things (IoCT) architecture that leverages edge (i.e., Fog) computing architectures to introduce intelligence and adaptability in integrated multi-scale IoT systems. The objective is to efficiently manage information acquisition, communication and processing across different scales of the IoT systems, while synergistically coupling learning of end-user behaviors to deliver efficient and customized services. The compelling use case of personalized healthcare will be used as an exemplar for a large class of IoT-enabled applications that can exploit and benefit from personalization empowered by a multi-layered, self-aware IoCT architecture."

The research consists of laboratory experiments on a highly controlled frictional fault that will help us understand the formation of earthquakes on natural faults.  Fault surfaces are made of of tiny contact points - asperities - and they individually slip and transfer stress to other asperities in the run-up to faulting.  In the field these are known as foreshocks.  In the laboratory we have control of nearly all variables so we can focus on the behaviors of interest.   Glaser conical displacement sensors will be used to very accurately measure the seismic signals from the asperity dynamics and invert back to how the foreshocks lead to earthquakes.  In contrast, in the field it is nearly impossible to observe the physical interaction of the fault surfaces leading up to an earthquake, so indirect observation methods such as finite source inversion use sensors at the Earth's surface to infer the precursory events taking place underground.  This project will improve the understanding of earthquake source mechanisms by comparing direct observations made possible in the laboratory to the indirect methods available to seismologists, and will shed light on what leads to an earthquake.<br/><br/>This project will elucidate the mechanisms behind three currently important questions in understanding earthquake precursors: What are the mechanistic components of preslip? What are the effects on rupture initiation from decreasing normal stress on faults? What are the mechanisms causing extended high frequency content in slow slip earthquakes and in ruptures following extended healing periods?  A sequence of tests will be conducted to examine the contact mechanisms of the fault interface leading to gross rupture.  This will shed light on so-called unusual phenomena, including episodic tremor, low and very-low frequency earthquakes and slow slip events.  Previous work by the principal investigator has shown tantalizing indications that the asperity-level mechanisms that lead to higher frequency content due to extended healing time, and for slow-slip events might be explained.  The laboratory-scale earthquakes, using PMMA as an analog of ductile rock, has provided data hinting that the same premonitory behavior appears in the experiment scaled to the much smaller size of our fault and contact asperities, e.g., preslip of minutes duration.  Use of a high-speed video camera and pressure sensitive film allows for direct observation of the fault surfaces before, during, and after simulated mini-earthquakes.  Seismological techniques are used to interpret data from an array of ultrasonic transducers and slip sensors adjacent to the fault. The combination of these direct and indirect observations will provide new insights as to the nucleation and propagation of slip, with a focus on the strength of asperities and interaction between them."

Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.

The technology is primarily addressing a fundamental problem associated with cell and gene therapy: viruses used to program cells before transplant into the body provoke undesirable immune response, may cause adverse effects as viral DNA integrates into the human genome, involve costly production and lengthy protocols, and can typically only be used once. This technology will enable an alternative engineering solution to this fundamental therapeutic problem which can eliminate such toxicity issues encompassing major applications in other areas including livestock, industrial biology, agriculture, drug discovery and development.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will further develop a technology that allows editing of single T cells with high transduction efficiency and minimal invasiveness. Parameters such as target efficiency, sensitivity/specificity of manipulation and delivery, device functionality after repetitive transduction, uniformity of manipulation across different single cells, as well as precision, reproducibility, hysteresis and stability of the motion of the microrobotic actuator will be optimized. The silicon-based microrobotic actuator is designed such that it can accurately track and target desired positions within single cells under an open loop control without a position feedback sensor, thus avoiding complicated control system electronics. A platform has been developed that includes a microrobotic actuator, which consists of a microstage driven by capacitive components that moves in 3D using an electrostatic field responsible for the independent motion to the nanoneedles. The key innovative concept here is to integrate the parallel architecture based 3D actuator technology with multiple nanoneedle biosensors so that each of them can be independently moved for targeted single-cell manipulation."

These systems not only altered forest conditions but may have helped maintain or even expand forest in this mosaic area of transitional tropical forest.  It is suggested that semi-intensive land use practices in production landscapes associated with primary food and industrial crops were concentrated in cluster core areas and high working forests dominated in peripheral areas.  Rather than predominantly slash and burn agricultural practices or open field farming that denude forest, it is suggested that pre-Columbian groups of the region practiced hybrid systems that involved forest to forest conversion across the region, which helped maintain and expand forest species across the region, even during the period ca. 1250-1650 CE when settlements reached their maximum size and integration in clusters. The research informs debates on pre-Columbian population levels and human impacts in the Amazon, notably the maximal degree of anthropogenic influence on pre-industrial Amazonian forest ecosystems in the southern Amazon transitional forests and dynamics of coupled human-environmental systems in relation to climate change, sustainability and cultural heritage. It articulates with scientific and public interests in sustainability, including multi-scalar and multi-cultural collaborations in large projects and public anthropology developed through participation, partnership and education in Brazil and the USA.<br/><br/>Dr. Heckenberger and his team will examine putative off-site production areas situated between major terminal pre-Columbian towns and villages and compare these settings to settlement areas and putative areas of non-production standing forest areas, in terms of soils and forest cover.  The team includes archaeology, paleoecology and ethno-ecologists and continues a successful participatory research program that involves international collaboration and engagement with local indigenous communities. Four months of fieldwork, including training and collaboration workshops, will focus on off-site soil sampling in 45 discrete areas, as well as general ethnoecological characterization of forest vegetation in each area. Additionally, wetland testing is proposed to collect well controlled samples of pollen, micro-charcoal, and other remains, to provide a picture of local vegetation in areas of large settlements and broader regional patterns."

The project will provide new insights regarding the origins and effects of income inequality on measures of individual well-being as well as to the heterogeneous mechanisms through which relatively egalitarian societies exhibit increases in the distribution of wealth within communities.  Through the conduct of research using consistent methods across a broad range of site, the project will facilitate the education, training, and mentoring of early-career scholars in data acquisition and analysis.  The project will result in new software for analyses using this kind of approach that will be made available for use by others through an open-source platform.  Because the project will include assessments of how economic factors and policy decisions that affect the structure of networks are likely to impact the long-run distribution of wealth, project findings can assist in the design of policies and interventions to reduce inequality by fostering particular ties within a community.<br/><br/>To assess how connections within social networks affect wealth distributions over time, the investigators will collect data in 25 locations across the globe.  The data will be collected regarding who is connected to whom and what their level of wealth is at the beginning of the study and four years later.  The study sites exhibit geographic and socioecological diversity, and the researchers will examine communities that includes hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, wage laborers, and intensive agriculturalists as well as varying degrees of involvement with market economies and national political systems.  Data regarding network, wealth, and household characteristics will be analyzed to determine whether and how networks matter in determining outcomes of wealth and inequality.

The focus here is on testing hypotheses drawn from economic theory about how new environmental policies affect business and public health in the rapidly growing Chinese economy. China is about to adopt a new national program of cap-and-trade emissions policies. The research team will collect innovative measures of pollution, firm outcomes, and individual health. They will analyze these data to test the team's hypotheses about whether or not these policies will achieve the stated goals. Predicting and understanding the effects of these policies is important for many scientific reasons. What is more, the policies could potentially result in Chinese manufacturers facing much higher costs of environmental compliance, which would have important implications for worldwide trade and the comparative advantage of manufacturers in countries such as the United States that already have strong environmental controls. This project therefore will provide valuable new evidence to researchers around the world and policymakers in the United States who are charged with promoting US economic competitiveness.<br/><br/>The lack of reliable data are primary obstacles to understanding the world?s most ambitious market-based environmental policy using data from a recently implemented comprehensive cap and trade program.  The project will evaluate how emissions, firm outcomes, and individual health respond to this signature environmental policy. First the team will conduct a conventional program evaluation of the country's seven carbon trading pilot programs that were launched in late 2013.  This is analysis is already feasible using conventional empirical approaches, such as difference-in-differences analysis.  Second, they will extensive baseline measures for the 2017- launch of the national program as it comes online. Third, they will collect and assess innovative pollution and health measures and evaluate the nation?s early experience with its incipient national program. The project emphasizes analysis of independent and objective metrics rather than official government measures.  Heterogeneity in the program features by regional market furnishes a laboratory for identifying successful and unsuccessful program features. Rules governing the national program are currently being finalized and will be evaluated for the identification strategies they furnish."

Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are cyber-physical systems with increasingly complex<br/>software algorithms in control of a physical vehicle moving in uncertain real-world environments.<br/>Planned connectivity regulations and recent advances in vehicular autonomy by leading<br/>manufacturers imply that CAVs will be ubiquitous in the near future. Roads will be data-rich<br/>environments where a large number of wireless devices attached to vehicles, infrastructure, personal<br/>electronics, and wearable gadgets will transmit multimodal data. In this scenario, two serious challenges <br/>arise for CAVs: (1) Onboard computational limitations may imply a de facto upper bound on the number<br/>of data sources that can be accommodated by the autonomy algorithms, and may introduce the problem of<br/>appropriately choosing a smaller subset of the available data, and <br/>(2) Given the finite amount of radio frequency<br/>spectrum and the rapidly growing number of wireless applications and end-users, spectrum scarcity arises,<br/>for which current communication protocols do not suffice. We observe that these two challenges are in fact<br/>intricately related, and that it is beneficial to address them together.<br/><br/>To this end, the goal of this project is to investigate bidirectional interactions between the<br/>technologies of autonomy and of wireless connectivity in cyber-physical systems. Using CAVs as<br/>a case study in cyber-physical systems, we propose to investigate how estimation and control<br/>algorithms affect - and are affected by - software-defined radio communications in spectrum-scarce,<br/>data-rich environments. The technical premise of this project is an emphasis on data-rich environments,<br/>where too much data can overwhelm autonomy algorithms, e.g. real-time short-horizon trajectory<br/>planners for vehicles. The proposed approach of selecting the data sources that are likely to be<br/>the ""most informative"" is a new aspect compared to planning algorithms in the literature.<br/>Furthermore, this selection is dynamic, in that it evolves with the trajectory plan. This selective<br/>connectivity also helps the wireless spectrum sensing algorithm to converge faster by limiting the<br/>spatial regions to sweep for potential connections. The proposed trajectory planning algorithm is<br/>based on the so-called method of lifted graphs, which promises to bridge the gap between fast<br/>geometric path planning algorithms and slower control-theoretic techniques that incorporate vehicle<br/>dynamical constraints. Beyond CAVs, the proposed technical approach can be applied to other cyber-physical<br/>systems where several non-cooperative agents communicate over wireless channels. The proposed trajectory<br/>planning approach is sufficiently general to allow the formulations and solutions of different<br/>application-specific planning problems."

Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas. Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain. We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions. Whereas improved agronomy could raise yields by 5-10%, improved marketing could raise revenue >25%, especially for high value crops. In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs. Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions. We have bundled a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data. These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management. Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future. Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast. This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products."

However, additive manufacturing has been slow to use for production scale operations.  Currently, the variability in porosity, even for identical build parameters, is a significant technical challenge facing additive manufacturing.  This award supports fundamental research into the detection and quantification of porosity in a selective laser sintering (SLS) system during fabrication.  The goal of this research is to develop the theory of ultrasound scattering for pores and couple it with in-line additive manufacturing quality control and metrology in a SLS testbed.  The theory will be developed by computer modelling and verified by both off-line and in-line measurements of production quality.  The computer models will be used to develop simplifying assumptions to make the problem tractable in real-time.  Once the validity and limitations of the assumptions have been evaluated, the theory will be validated experimentally using both standard ultrasound transducers as well as a custom laser-system for in-line quality assessment.  In the future, this research could cause additive manufacturing to be more reliable and predictable, resulting in more energy efficient and reliable mechanical systems. While advancing the science of additive manufacturing, the research will also be used as a catalyst to excite K-12 students.  In the summer, teachers from small high schools and rural schools, whose graduates have historically not studied engineering, will join the research team.  After assisting with the research and receiving a course on nondestructive evaluation and additive manufacturing, the teachers will conduct a project at their respective schools during the following academic year with their students.  In addition, the teachers will assist their students in organizing an ""Engineering Fair"" for local elementary students in their community to showcase their project.  <br/><br/>The research objectives of the project are to 1) Develop scattering theory to accurately quantify porosity from backscattered ultrasound signals and 2) Develop a laser-based ultrasound system for a new method of porosity assessment based on the scattering theory.  The scattering theory will be developed using numerical simulations of scattering from pores of various sizes and densities imbedded in steel, titanium, and cobalt-chrome microstructures.  The simulations will be utilized to explore the limitations of the approximations made as part of the scattering theory, and will include both focused ultrasound waves from a piezoelectric transducer and the backscattered echoes of longitudinal waves generated and detected by lasers.  The laser-based ultrasound signals will be filtered to allow smaller defects to be characterized near the surface of the part.  The scattering theory will then be experimentally validated using both finished and in-process parts.  The validation on in-process parts will be conducted on a custom made prototype laser-sintering system that will be developed as part of the project.  The developed theory may be applicable to other manufacturing technologies such as composites and pressure die casting as well as other additive manufacturing techniques."

Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.<br/><br/>The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events.

As a field, comparative immunology is undergoing a transformation propelled by the emergence of new and innovative genomic technologies and the recognition of a wider biological role for immunity. The study of organisms from the very simple (sponges) to the most complex (higher plants and animals) provides unique insight into immunobiology, medicine and evolution. NACI 2017 is designed to bring together established and early career investigators who study immune function in a diverse range of animal species to discuss current research, assess the future directions of the comparative immunology community and develop a plan for meeting these needs. This workshop is expected to result in increased understanding of comparative immunology, which in turn will lead to novel disease prevention and treatment strategies.  The majority of the requested funds will be used to provide trainee stipend awards to twenty trainees, which will allow these trainees to participate in the NACI 2017 workshop. Efforts will be made to recruit participants from under-represented groups.  The results discussed at the workshop will be disseminated by a publication summarizing the meeting, and on a freely accessible internet site.<br/><br/>The North American Comparative Immunology Workshop (NACI 2017) will bring together comparative immunologists from across the continent.  Collectively, these research groups study species from sponges to mammals from a variety of angles; including pathology, development, evolution, and ecology.  Although the studied species may be diverse, current research strategies rely on similar omics-based strategies to identify immune-related sequences in each species. Genomic studies demonstrate that even closely related species can possess numerous divergent immune genes and that genes once thought to be indispensable for immune function in one lineage have been lost in others. It is also becoming clear that orthologous immune genes, once thought to play the same role in all species, may in fact, play different roles in different species. These findings are germane not only to our understanding of the natural history of immunity and vaccine development in aqua- and agri-culturally important species but also to the development of human immunotherapeutic monoclonals (the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry). Thus, there is an imminent need to develop assays to study immune gene function in a wide range of species. Despite the recent development of efficient and broadly applicable genome engineering techniques, technological hurdles remain for non-model species, such as the lack of reference genomes, lack of inbred or clonal lines, long generation times and failure to reproduce in captivity. NACI 2017 will provide a venue for the whole field to discuss these hurdles extensively, as a community, and develop a vision for moving Comparative Immunology forward."

This research contributes towards progress of science by obtaining and analyzing novel cross-layer IoT sensing, communication, and computing strategies that outperform classical strategies by several orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and reliability. For validation, the researchers examine improvements on practically relevant problems of health monitoring through neuro-interfaces and distributed camera inference. The research involves several graduate and undergraduate courses, with emphasis on engaging female and minority students.<br/><br/>Severe energy constraints provide a compelling incentive for cross-layer designs of ""cognitive"" IoT systems to jointly sense, compress, communicate, and compute. However, naive cross-layer designs can reduce tolerance to system faults, e.g., sensing/ communication/computation errors. The investigators pursue a systematic understanding, utilizing it to obtain novel cross-layer designs of cognitive IoT strategies that gracefully trade off fault tolerance and efficiency through novel error-correction techniques compatible with limited fields of view. They benchmark this trade off against novel information-theoretic fundamental limits. The obtained techniques increase the robustness of algorithms that use, as a first step, linear projections on distributedly-sensed large dimensional data. Focusing on algorithms for the widely applicable k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) problem, the researchers obtain improved algorithms and analyze performance-efficiency-robustness tradeoffs, bridging information theory, statistics, and machine learning."

The hydrogen isotope records will be produced from existing cores from lakes in Costa Rica, and will serve as the western anchor in a larger network of precipitation records that the researchers plan to develop through the broader circum-Caribbean region, including the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain. The hydrogen isotope analyses will document the geography of multi-decadal drought during the Terminal Classic Drought (~1200-850 cal yr BP), the Little Ice Age (~500-100 cal yr BP), and at other times, and reveal whether these were exceptional or outlier droughts for the Holocene as a whole.  Comparison with local paleoenvironmental and archaeological evidence will show how past droughts affected vegetation, fire regimes, and prehistoric agriculture."

The commercial potential of this project centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling. The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  <br/><br/>The miniaturization of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited, yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers. As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication, and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the prototype."

This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.<br/><br/>The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers.

Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.<br/><br/>In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.<br/>"

A key advantage of this project's technology is enhanced cybersecurity as it does not rely on external signals for navigation. Further, this project will contribute open-source software to the scientific community. It is envisioned that development of a software toolbox that integrates with the popular ROS (Robot Operating System) library will allow researchers to simulate autonomous navigation without GPS.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a result of research into the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In SLAM, a robot is not given prior knowledge of its environment, it must use its sensory data and actions to simultaneously build a map of its environment and position itself within its uncertain map. Competing methods in this area exhibit positioning errors which may be unsuitable for long-term navigation. The work developed here shows that by fusing orientation sensing with short-range sensing, the system attain a simplification of the underlying optimization problem. This allows fast and globally optimal solutions. In this approach, a vehicle uses a camera to track celestial bodies in the sky which allows the vehicle to estimate its orientation in space, this information is fused with short-range sensors such as lasers and cameras which track features in vicinity of the vehicle.  Using the proposed approach, a system can achieve 100x improvement in position error over existing methods."

This integration drastically increases the size of the data sets that need to be analyzed to make biological conclusions.  However, existing tools yield low accuracy and exhibit poor scalability for big proteogenomics data.  This CAREER grant is expected to lay a foundation for fast algorithmic and high performance computing solutions suitable for analyzing big proteogenomics data sets.  Design of accurate computational algorithms suitable for peta-scale data sets will be pursued and the software implementation will run on massively parallel supercomputers and graphical processing units.  The direction in this CAREER proposal is towards designing and building infrastructure, which would be useful for the broadest biological and ecological community.  A comprehensive interdisciplinary education will be executed for K12, undergraduate and graduate students to ensure that US retains its global leadership position in STEM fields.  This project thus serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed CAREER grant is to design and develop algorithmic and high performance computing (HPC) foundations for practical sublinear and parallel algorithms for big proteogenomics data - especially for non-model organisms with previously unsequenced or partially sequenced genomes.  Integration of MS and NGS data sets required for proteogenomics studies exhibit enormous volume and velocity of data: NGS technologies such as Chip-Seq can generate tera-bytes of DNA/RNA data and mass spectrometers can generate millions of spectra (with thousand of peak per spectra).  The current systems for analyzing MS data are mainly driven by heuristic practices and do not scale well.  This CAREER proposal will explore a new class of reductive algorithms for analysis of MS data that can allow peptide deductions in sublinear time, compression algorithms that operate in sub-linear space, and denovo algorithms that operate on lossy reduced-form of the MS data.  Novel low-complexity sampling and reductive algorithms that can exploit the sparsity of MS data such as non-uniform FFT based convolution kernels can lead to superior similarity metrics not prone to spurious correlations.  The bottleneck in large system-biology studies is the low-scalability of coarse-grained parallel algorithms that do not exploit MS-specific data characteristics and lead to unbalanced loads due to non-uniform compute time required for peptide deductions.  This project aims to explore design and implementation of scalable algorithms for both NGS and MS data on multicore and GPU platforms using domain decomposition techniques based on spectral clustering, MS-specific hybrid load-balancing based on work-load estimate, and HPC dimensionality reduction strategies and novel out-of-core sketching & streaming fine-grained parallel algorithms.  These HPC solutions can enable previously impractical proteogenomics projects and allow biologists to perform computational experiments without needing expensive hardware.  All of the implemented algorithms will be made available as open-source code interfaced with Galaxy framework to ensure maximum impact in systems biology labs.  These designed techniques will then be integrated so that matching of spectra to RNA-Seq data can be accomplished without a reconstructed transcriptome.  The proposed tools aim to reveal new biological insight such as novel genes, proteins and PTM's and are crucial steps towards understanding the genomic, proteomic and evolutionary aspects of species in the tree of life."

Clays comprise very fine (< 2 um), electrically charged, chemically active particles whose behavior and assembly are strongly affected by physico-chemical forces operating on individual particles at the smaller (i.e., molecular and interfacial) scales.  Clay minerals of different varieties occur widely in natural geological environments and are generally found in the form of aggregates or clusters whose interactions control the macroscopic engineering properties of clay-rich soils used in the design and construction of infrastructure.  While micromechanics-based experimental and computational research has advanced significantly the understanding of the behavior of sands (particle sizes greater than 75um), the importance of the particulate nature of clays has not been extensively investigated.  This collaborative project aims to develop and validate a new multiscale framework for understanding the macroscopic (i.e., continuum scale) mechanical properties of clays by studying the microscale aggregation of elementary clay particles and the interactions between the resultant clay aggregates. The project will provide the fundamental understanding needed to develop the next generation of constitutive models for mechanical properties of clays that can be used for subsurface engineering, ultimately reducing risks and costs associated with the design of foundations, underground construction and use of geological energy resources (e.g., clay shales, etc.).  The research will impact directly upon the education of future geotechnical engineering and geomechanics students through the creation of online modules related to the small-scale measurement and multiscale modeling of clay behavior. <br/><br/>The research work comprises a closely-integrated program of multiscale experimentation, atomistic and coarse-grained multiscale simulations for one common clay mineral, illite.  The research involves the following main tasks: 1) modeling and experimental validation of individual clay aggregate behavior under a range of porewater chemistry conditions; 2) development of new modeling techniques and experimental methods for investigating aggregate-aggregate interactions and fabric (i.e., quantitative measurement of particle orientation and of orientation distribution function); and 3) validation of multiscale model predictions through comparison with macroscopic measurements of clay properties.  Experimental measurements will use existing laboratory facilities at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) as well as the analytical facilities at the Argonne National Laboratory, while numerical simulations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will take advantages of NSF eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) national supercomputing resources.  By developing a framework for understanding particulate-based clay micromechanics, the research aims to provide an innovative multiscale perspective for explaining the underlying basis of continuum-based clay properties such as cohesion and creep, which have to date only been observed phenomenologically via macroscopic approaches.  The long-term goal is to generalize the methodology to enable bottom-up prediction of mechanical properties for complex natural soils that comprise mixtures of different clay minerals with silt- and sand-sized particles as well as varying porewater chemistry."

The millions of people affected include veterans coping with the invisible disability of blast injury, women victimized by domestic violence, and athletes and children injured on playing fields. To improve care for injured people and their families, a better understanding of the experience of brain injury is needed. In its focus on the profoundly disruptive psychosocial aftermath of brain injury, the project offers a window into this experience. The project also offers a new angle on the debates over what it means to be human in a time when neurology dominates the human sciences: Have we come to see our personhood as fully dependent on our brains, and if not, on what do we found our identity and our claim to the rights of a person?

Through qualitative methods-including discursive analysis of the ways in which injured people and their families conceptualize these anger outbursts in published writings, in artwork, and in interviews-the project distinguishes the diverse manifestations and consequences of post-injury anger, identifies the strategies individuals and families use to manage it, and investigates how people think about the relationships between brain, mind, self, and society in the neuroscientific era. Understanding how people talk and think about post-injury anger can lead to better interventions into disrupted family systems and better ways of securing adherence to anger-management protocols, which can lead to better family relationships, a lighter burden on caregivers, and better adjustment for those who suffer from the effects of brain injury. More generally, an exposition of the ways in which we think about our brains and our personhood can inform debates about the rights of the neurologically disabled. Theoretically, the project will contribute to the sociology of culture and identity, to the sociology of health and disability, to the sociology of emotions through its focus on anger?perhaps the least studied emotion?and to the sociology of science and technology through attention to how people interpret the relevance of images of their own brains."

In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption; 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated CO2."

By defining an efficient security<br/>and scalability-enhancing edge architecture that moves data processing close to users, it minimizes<br/>data transfer latencies and overhead in the network. The fusion of sensor data from different sources<br/>can significantly improve the efficiency of many existing systems. In some areas, massive<br/>bandwidth is about to become available to cellular and WiFi networks in the millimeter wave bands.<br/>The Federal Government recently opened up 28 GHz at frequencies above 24<br/>GHz and promises to revolutionize wireless systems and enable IoT applications never before<br/>conceived, particularly in dense urban areas. Smart traffic and connected (autonomous) cars are an<br/>example application area enabled by the new bandwidth, which requires combining these different<br/>approaches in the architectural design of large-scale IoT systems. Integrating IoT with edge/fog<br/>computing, millimeter wave (mmWave) technologies and distributed processing enables optimizing<br/>the system level performance considering system capacity, reduced network bandwidth for data and<br/>control traffic, increased system level programmability and automation, accurate location-aawareness,<br/>virtualization, low latency, scalability, and enhanced security and privacy. One of the<br/>novel aspects of our proposed system is that it transitions seamlessly from an emulated and<br/>simulated environment to actual production deployment, and mixtures of these modes, facilitating<br/>robust and reliable IoT systems at scale.<br/><br/>The project provides contributions in several essential areas of IoT network architectures and<br/>security: 1) minimizing the need of manual configuration in large-scale IoT networks; 2) scalable<br/>authentication and key management systems; 3) efficient distributed IoT architecture to perform<br/>complex and delay-sensitive tasks, with rapid deployment and prototyping; 4) secure<br/>interoperability between heterogeneous IoT devices; and 5) positioning and capacity optimization<br/>based on mmWave communications, considering especially smart traffic and vehicle-to-vehicle<br/>communications. The project proposes a multi-layered approach for scaling IoT systems in<br/>simulation and emulation, allowing to combine physical systems with emulated systems,<br/>incorporating new mmWave RF and network models, network emulation, virtual systems, models<br/>of the physical world and user interfaces. The emulation system allows the team to explore mobile<br/>edge and fog computing to enhance efficiency, reduce control-loop delays and assure privacy of<br/>sensitive data. A new authentication model and naming system allows scaling for deployment and<br/>programming. The prototype open-source IoT emulator, along with the mmWave channel models,<br/>developed in the project will allow industrial IoT system developers to more rapidly and reliably<br/>develop new IoT systems. The authentication and naming components will be submitted for<br/>possible standardization. The new channel models are likely to inform spectrum allocation<br/>decisions for mmWave bands by national regulators."

MHK energy is a socially and environmentally friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers, tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments. Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will transform our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing locally and with The University of Washington."

TBI is quite common; every year, over 10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job, while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings to the healthcare system may also be obtained. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration should ensue."

This project at North Carolina Central State University will investigate mathematical modeling with probability distributions and will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their statistical knowledge through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Georgetown University.<br/><br/>Count data arise in a variety of situations and are often modeled with a Poisson distribution. In many cases, however, the data do not satisfy the Poisson distribution's property of equal mean and variance. This project will examine the two-parameter Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution that accounts for over-dispersion where the variance is greater than the mean and under-dispersion where the variance is less than the mean. The CMP distribution captures the Poisson, Bernoulli, and geometric distributions as special cases. The first goal of this project is to conduct a simulation study which compares properties of the CMP distribution to those of mixed Poisson probability distributions, such as the Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-Lindley and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, that have traditionally been used to model over-dispersed data. The second goal is to derive and develop inferential methods for a bivariate CMP distribution. To demonstrate the flexibility of the CMP distribution and its extensions, applications to real-world data will be considered. This research will expand the class of probability distributions that are available to model count data."

Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds."

The SST anomalies in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans that have been invoked are distinct from those associated with El Nino or La Nina. The SST anomalies were warm in the Southern Indian Ocean and Western Tropical Pacific and neutral to cool around the maritime continent and central Equatorial Pacific Ocean. A recent analog to that state was the winter of 1990/91. A second example of an extremes-generating ocean state is that of persistent, multiyear cold conditions in the Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean. For the last century and a half for which SST records exists, extreme drought in western North America has been associated with such Tropical Pacific Ocean conditions. 1999 to 2002 was one such recent state. In contrast to El Nino and La Nina events, the ocean dynamics and thermodynamics of these two extremes-generating states have not been extensively studied. This project will conduct a detailed analysis of the ocean dynamic and thermodynamic processes that cause the oceans to adopt these SST patterns. The ocean states to be studied generate droughts, floods, extreme cold and snow across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe. The societal impacts of these events have been large. Improving their prediction and the understanding of their frequency of occurrence and intensity are key to enabling adaptation and disaster preparedness. Prediction requires understanding and the proposed work will advance understanding of the oceanic causes of the SST anomalies responsible for them, thus enabling advances in prediction and characterization of ocean-forced weather and climate extremes. The results of the study will improve our capability to model and forecast such hazards and events. Further, results generated in this work will readily be communicated to the communities that can advance efforts for prediction, societal planning and adaptation via lead investigator's close involvement in NOAA's Drought task force and the National Integrated Drought Information System's Task Force. The data created will be served via the International Research Institute of Columbia University's Data Library and be available as a research resource to the entire community.<br/><br/>The project is centered on the analysis of the momentum and heat budgets of the upper oceans contained within three ocean reanalyses: the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts' Ocean Reanalysis (1958 to present), the consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (Version 4, 1993 to present) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Ensemble Climate Data Assimilation system (1960 to present). The contributions of surface fluxes, vertical mixing and dynamical ocean heat convergence by the mean flow and transient eddies will be evaluated for the extremes generating states using standard numerical procedures. Dynamical and mixing contributions will be related to changes in upper ocean heat content and to changes in currents and vertical motion which in turn will be related to wind stress forcing. Guided by a series of hypotheses, the causes of the extremes-generating ocean states will be determined to the extent allowed by data accuracy and sample size limitation. Long term trends in the ocean reanalyses and surface fluxes, as well as ensembles of climate model simulations, will be examined for any evidence that human-driven climate change is altering the probability of extremes-generating ocean states and the physical reasons why. The project will provide a comprehensive assessment of the oceanographic and ocean-atmosphere causes of the ocean states associated with two important extremes-generating SST anomalies. This work, largely observationally-based, will determine the physics underlying oceanic causes of recent climate and weather extremes."

The system considers pertinent medical information, information about the tooth intended to be replaced, the available anatomical spaces, the quality of soft tissue of the patient and information about the patient?s oral habits. Research-based algorithms correlate the amount of bone remaining, space available and the type of implant to be used. After assessing the data received, the platform provides an analysis of possible outcomes and, if appropriate, a proposed treatment plan including the type of surgery recommended, the type of implant, and if there is any supplementary surgeries needed to be performed, such as bone or gum grafts. The software will also recommend healing times and post-operative care guidelines for the practitioner that are specifically customized to the patient.  This technology combines all the factors which directly affect the osseointegration of the dental implant, the bone-implant surface interaction and the response of the soft-tissue of the patient to the treatment."

Clays comprise very fine (< 2 um), electrically charged, chemically active particles whose behavior and assembly are strongly affected by physico-chemical forces operating on individual particles at the smaller (i.e., molecular and interfacial) scales.  Clay minerals of different varieties occur widely in natural geological environments and are generally found in the form of aggregates or clusters whose interactions control the macroscopic engineering properties of clay-rich soils used in the design and construction of infrastructure.  While micromechanics-based experimental and computational research has advanced significantly the understanding of the behavior of sands (particle sizes greater than 75um), the importance of the particulate nature of clays has not been extensively investigated.  This collaborative project aims to develop and validate a new multiscale framework for understanding the macroscopic (i.e., continuum scale) mechanical properties of clays by studying the microscale aggregation of elementary clay particles and the interactions between the resultant clay aggregates. The project will provide the fundamental understanding needed to develop the next generation of constitutive models for mechanical properties of clays that can be used for subsurface engineering, ultimately reducing risks and costs associated with the design of foundations, underground construction and use of geological energy resources (e.g., clay shales, etc.).  The research will impact directly upon the education of future geotechnical engineering and geomechanics students through the creation of online modules related to the small-scale measurement and multiscale modeling of clay behavior. <br/><br/>The research work comprises a closely-integrated program of multiscale experimentation, atomistic and coarse-grained multiscale simulations for one common clay mineral, illite.  The research involves the following main tasks: 1) modeling and experimental validation of individual clay aggregate behavior under a range of porewater chemistry conditions; 2) development of new modeling techniques and experimental methods for investigating aggregate-aggregate interactions and fabric (i.e., quantitative measurement of particle orientation and of orientation distribution function); and 3) validation of multiscale model predictions through comparison with macroscopic measurements of clay properties.  Experimental measurements will use existing laboratory facilities at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) as well as the analytical facilities at the Argonne National Laboratory, while numerical simulations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will take advantages of NSF eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) national supercomputing resources.  By developing a framework for understanding particulate-based clay micromechanics, the research aims to provide an innovative multiscale perspective for explaining the underlying basis of continuum-based clay properties such as cohesion and creep, which have to date only been observed phenomenologically via macroscopic approaches.  The long-term goal is to generalize the methodology to enable bottom-up prediction of mechanical properties for complex natural soils that comprise mixtures of different clay minerals with silt- and sand-sized particles as well as varying porewater chemistry."

There has been intense investigation of whether the training of working memory can enhance cognitive functioning, but with controversial outcomes. There is however recent evidence that cognitive training of working memory and other cognitive skills can benefit from non-invasive brain stimulation applied during training. In particular, repeated application of direct current stimulation to certain regions of the scalp can improve the outcomes of a training program intended to improve working memory. Furthermore, this enhancement effect is maintained after for up to several months or a year post-training without subsequent training or stimulation. In the proposed research, we examine the neurobiological mechanisms by which this improvement may occur. Given the potential effectiveness of direct current stimulation, its accessibility and low cost, understanding the neural mechanisms by which stimulation exerts its effects could have direct implications for constructing more effective interventions. <br/><br/>The neural mechanisms by which current stimulation achieves its facilitative effects on memory are largely unknown. The research program will combine transcranial direct current stimulation with simultaneous functional neuroimaging to examine the effect of stimulation on underlying neural activity. Individuals will be trained on a short-term memory task for several days and will be scanned as training proceeds. The neuroimaging data collected will measure local perfusion stages that accompany the stimulation during the training itself, when accompanied by different types of transcranial stimulation. The studies will 1) compare network connectivity with and without stimulation as learning proceeds over the course of a training intervention and 2) compare the impact of stimulation on neural activity when the anode and cathode are reversed. Electrode placement sites will be optimally adjusted based on each participant's individual activation patterns during a working memory task. The results of these studies will address the nature of the cognitive changes due to working memory training with direct cortical stimulation as well as the relationship of these changes to patterns of neural activity."

In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.

Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.<br/><br/>To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.<br/>"

In our previous two NSF funded REU sites, 65 students have participated of which 96% were underrepresented minority students and more than 60% were females. 78% of these students were from four-year and community colleges. Four African American REU participants from our first REU have received PhDs in MSE. Several of the REU participants in the last funding cycle have joined graduate programs, medical school, or transitioned from community college to 4-year colleges, and the majority of the remainder plan on pursuing graduate studies.  Their participation has resulted in journal and conference publications, and oral and poster presentations. Through this REU Site, Tuskegee University will continue to expose undergraduates from four-year and community colleges in Alabama and neighboring states to the research environment. The research projects chosen for students are in Nano-Bio Materials Science and Engineering, an area of high national interest that is vital for technological developments in engineering, science, and medicine. Involvement of REU students in these emerging research areas and existing on-campus multidisciplinary research and education centers will enable them to develop skills needed to excel in academia and STEM careers. Some of the highlights of this REU site include: participant mentoring by minority Ph.D. students, interactions with deans of various colleges at TU and MSE minority Ph.D. alumni as seminar speakers, workshops, summer presentations, and field trips that will give students a broad appreciation and an incentive for pursuing graduate studies in STEM disciplines.

Research activities will be focused on a wide range of important areas including synthesis of nanoparticles from agriculture and poultry waste for biomedical applications and antimicrobial properties, drug loading and cell adhesion properties of agarose-based hydrogel films, synthesis of protein coated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for prostate cancer diagnosis, fabrication of nanocomposite scaffolds using electrospinning and forcespinning techniques for bone regeneration applications, and structure-property relationship of nano-bio composites through experiments and simulations. Involvement of REU students in these challenging and meaningful research areas with minority Ph.D. students as mentors will have a significant impact on their decision to pursue graduate studies and STEM based careers. REU students will also participate in several unique activities including a 2-credit hour Introduction to Research course and preparation for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Students will learn critical thinking, qualitative reasoning, mathematical, analytical and research skills through these activities that will be integral in their transition toward graduate studies and STEM careers. Site activities will also support student professional development including professional seminars by role models, field trips to local industrial sites, summer presentations and workshops. Finally, a comprehensive assessment plan will be implemented to assess the impact of the project on students including interest in research, progress in education, and long-term professional development.

Specifically, this research will characterize sintered powder porosity and its effects on thermal properties, develop finite element thermomechanical simulations incorporating porosity-dependent thermal properties for temperature and stress predictions in EBAM, evaluate overhang geometry effects on the part thermomechanical behaviors in EBAM and correlate with warping severity, and investigate different support patterns to evaluate the effectiveness of a designed support.<br/><br/>The outcome of this research will enhance the performance and efficient usage of the EBAM technology through improved and effective support structures.

The goal of this proposal is to develop techniques to deploy mission critical applications with stringent requirements in IoT environments. <br/>This proposal will address the problem of deploying mission-critical systems by focusing on the following tasks: (a) The first thrust will be development of techniques to customize deployments to meet the needs of specific applications. One would like to design the IoT software base to be generic so that it can be used by a wide range of applications. However, generic software may not be suitable to to meet the requirements of mission critical applications. This may force the designers to manually develop services specialized for specific applications. The project will develop techniques that can automatically optimize generic software to obtain customized versions to meet the needs of specific applications. (b) The second thrust is the development of compositional techniques that will systematically exploit commonalities between the applications. As there may be multiple applications that share the underlying resources, exploiting such commonalities will be essential to meet stringent performance requirements. Extensive performance evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the performance of implementations generated by the proposed techniques with respect to manually developed implementations."

The ability to multiply large matrices faster would have tangible impact on the world. For the past fifty years, computer scientists have been developing a rich mathematical theory of matrix multiplication algorithms;  still, it is not clear exactly how fast matrices can be multiplied, nor what the best algorithms would even look like.  The main goal of the PI is to deepen and extend the theory of matrix multiplication, and to search for faster algorithms for the problem.<br/> <br/>The most studied version of matrix multiplication is when the matrix entries come from an underlying ring such as the integers (Z), and the ""plus"" and ""times"" operations are addition and multiplication over Z. The algorithmic progress on ring matrix multiplication is a prime example of algorithmic ingenuity. For decades the trivial approach was deemed optimal until deep theory led to significant and surprising improvements. The theoretical study of ring matrix multiplication algorithms aims to pinpoint the exponent ""omega"" of matrix multiplication, considered to be the main measure of progress on the problem. The number omega is the smallest real number for which there is an algorithm that multiplies two square matrices of dimension n using n^(omega+o(1)) operations (additions and multiplications of numbers). Since the output has size n^2, omega is at least 2; the most recent bound omega < 2.373 was obtained by the PI. The PI aims to investigate new approaches to improving the bound on omega and related parameters, with a long-term goal of designing a fast and practical algorithm.<br/> <br/>The impressive improvements above only apply to ring matrix multiplication. However, in many applications, different, potentially more complex matrix products are needed. For instance, in computing shortest paths in a network, one relies on the so called distance product of real matrices for which the ""plus"" operation is minimum and the ""times"" operation is addition. The matrix product is no longer over a ring, but rather over a semiring. Non-ring matrix products are not as well understood as ring matrix multiplication; some, such as the distance product, don't even seem to admit much faster algorithms than the brute-force algorithm that follows from their definition. The second major goal of the PI is to study a large variety of non-ring matrix products, develop algorithms for them, and broaden and strengthen their applications.<br/> <br/>This project has several educational goals. These include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, the development of new courses directly related to the described topics, and incorporating these topics into existing core algorithms courses. The lectures and project materials will be available on the course website for the general public. The PI is wholeheartedly committed to diversity. The PI has experience in recruiting and mentoring both undergraduate and graduate minority students, and will continue to take an active role in seeking and recruiting students from diverse cultures and backgrounds."

However, these cells are rare and difficult to maintain in culture because they quickly lose their multi-potency after being removed from their native environment.  In vivo, NSCs reside adjacent to a vascular niche, suggesting that it may be possible to maintain these cells ex vivo if critical functional features of the vascular niche are recreated in the culture environment.<br/><br/>The hypothesis of the proposed studies is that formation of a perfused, functional vasculature within 3-D extracellular matrix promotes self-renewal of the surrounding NSCs.  To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Create a neurovascular unit that contains perfused vasculature and NSCs within 3-D matrix using a novel cell printing technology.  2) Establish the maturation process and functionalities of the synthesized structures with regard to matrix properties and culture parameters.  3) Examine the NSC behavior and cell fate using the engineered neurovascular unit; and determine critical factors that influence NSC fate and its relationship to the functional status of the vasculature.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  The proposed research will build a 3-D perfused vascular niche to study NSCs in a physiologically relevant experimental system, in which individual components and parameters can be easily manipulated.  Using this system, the proposed research will define critical factors to achieve functionality of the vasculature and will elucidate underlying mechanisms of NSC self-renewal in the dynamically perfused system. Since vasculature is a key element of many adult stem cell niches, this research will have broader ramifications in studying other stem cell fields.  Overall, this work will identify design principles and operating parameters for the printed structures to support the growth of the surrounding tissues in vitro, and thereby lay the foundation to fabricate tissues of appropriate thickness for biomedical applications in the future.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The proposed research has broader scientific impact in generating fundamental knowledge related to 3-D vascular tissue formation and its role in regulating NSC fate.  Therefore, the proposed studies are expected to help develop methods for the ex vivo expansion of patient-specific NSCs to treat spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases, which will benefit patients and the society at large.  Research will be integrated with educational and outreach activities targeting K-12 education and underrepresented groups.  Activities demonstrating how engineers can solve societal challenges will provide incentives to students to pursue careers in science and engineering."

Manipulating plant hormones with chemical and genetic tools has been instrumental in the green revolution; a deeper understanding of how hormones control plant growth will likely fuel future advances in agriculture. In this project, biological sensors will be developed to detect a recently recognized plant hormone called strigolactone, and an unknown molecule in plants (KL) that controls seed germination, seedling growth, and leaf shape. The biological sensors will be used in this project to purify KL, which may be a novel hormone, and to identify genes that produce it. Discovery of KL may lead to the development of new agrichemicals or genetic modifications that promote uniform seed germination and seedling vigor, thus increasing crop yields. Strigolactone sensors will be useful tools for plant breeders to more easily develop crops with altered strigolactone levels, which can in turn influence the fertilizer requirements of crops and their susceptibility to weeds. Undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained in research skills and scientific communication, leading to enhancement of the scientific workforce. Research discoveries will be communicated to the public through journal publications, press releases, news articles, and local speaking opportunities.<br/><br/>Karrikins are compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination after fire and enhance seedling vigor. The karrikin signaling pathway is highly similar to the strigolactone signaling pathway, suggesting common ancestry. A receptor that is necessary for karrikin responses, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2), has been identified, but karrikins are unlikely to be its native ligand. The aims of this project are to (1) develop sensitive and specific biological assays to detect the unknown KAI2 ligand (KL) and strigolactones, (2) identify genes involved in KL biosynthesis, and (3) highly purify KL from plant extracts as a stepping stone toward its identification. Biological sensors for karrikins/KL and strigolactones based on transcriptional or proteolytic responses will be engineered. These bioassays will be used in genetic screens to identify KL-deficient mutants. Finally, bioassay-guided fractionation will be used to isolate KL in small molecule extracts from plants. The discovery of KL and KL biosynthesis genes will catalyze a new field of research in plant biology that impacts the understanding of seed dormancy, seedling photomorphogenesis, and leaf development. It will also provide insights into the ancestral function of the KAI2 signaling mechanism in basal land plants, which later duplicated and evolved to mediate growth control by strigolactones."

Chemical conversion of Hg in snowpack from non-volatile forms to gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) can lead to substantial degassing of Hg from snow, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric deposition. Contrary to the GEM chemistry seen in the midlatitude snowpack, preliminary observations from Toolik Lake, on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, provide evidence that photochemical GEM formation and degassing are suppressed in tundra snow and that for much of the winter, interstitial GEM is actually converted into non-volatile Hg. These patterns result in extended periods when interstitial snowpack air is depleted in GEM. If confirmed, this chemistry would likely signify a net transfer of atmospheric GEM to snow or underlying soils, thereby increasing Hg deposition to tundra ecosystems. Proposed project objectives are to investigate (1) the frequency and underlying processes that determine GEM depletion and formation in arctic snowpack and tundra soils; (2) the degree to which GEM dynamics cause vertical Hg exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and (3) how these processes provide additional sources &#8722; or sinks &#8722; of Hg via atmosphere-surface transfer and snowmelt input. GEM concentrations in soils, snow, and air, as well as vertical exchanges, will be characterized at Toolik Field Station. Measurements will be made by means of a snow-sampling manifold system allowing for fully automated and continuous all-winter measurements of trace gases at multiple depths in the undisturbed snowpack and the atmosphere. These experiments will be supplemented by flux chamber measurements to assess the contribution of the underlying tundra soils. Other trace gas observations, and chemical characterization of soil, snow, melt water, and soil water will be incorporated to assess the environmental and biogeochemical controls on GEM dynamics and the Hg budget. This proposed research will leverage ongoing LTER and NEON projects at the Toolik Field station, providing linkages between in-snow processes, tundra soil and freshwater biogeochemical cycling, pollution import into the Arctic, and ecosystem processes. The project will directly involve high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. It will expand an existing partnership with local high school chemistry classes through research presentations in classrooms, laboratory tours, and data analyses using study results. Dissemination to the scientific community will be accomplished through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and by communication with U.S. and international regulatory agencies. The general public will be reached through news releases, institutional publications, open house events, and a web site.

Although modern tumor motion management strategies for positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-guided RT are becoming more available, those techniques have yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice. This is mainly because not every patient will benefit from a costly and lengthy motion-managed PET/CT scan due to high intra-patient and inter-patient variability of respiratory patterns. The objective of this project is to bridge the knowledge gap of which motion management method would best benefit an individual patient. This project will develop a new decision-making paradigm, in which machine learning techniques will be developed to characterize respiratory motion patterns and combine them with other diagnostic factors to predict the benefits from motion management methods for each individual patient. A decision-analytic cohort model will be developed to compare and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the new decision paradigm and the traditional population-based radiation oncology practice of motion management based on our existing database of respiratory traces from more than 3,000 patients. While specifically applied to decisions surrounding respiratory motion management, the developed decision paradigm can be generalized and applied to other real life decision analysis problems.<br/><br/>This award supports fundamental research in data mining/machine learning and decision analysis, which will provide needed knowledge for the development of tools for effective management of patient-specific tumor motion. The modeling effort in this project will 1) establish a new mathematical foundation for supervised multivariate sparse variable selection and prediction to discover complicated multivariate relationships among high-dimensional variables; 2) construct a general integrated validation framework to rigorously test the cost-effectiveness of patient-specific health interventions. The new multivariate sparse variable selection and prediction approach can be used to build an interpretable prediction model, handle high-dimensional data with a low sample size, avoid under-shrinkage effect, and incorporate structured group selection. The cost-effectiveness analysis framework integrates the outcome of prediction model, the treatment effect and survival outcome model. This modeling aims to quantitatively estimate long-term cancer survival outcomes from improvement in patient-specific planning of radiation dosing by selective motion control."

This question is central to many economic problems. It is particularly relevant for a vast array of antitrust questions ranging from the approval of mergers to the detection of price fixing cases, as well as to help guide regulatory institutions in markets such as financial services, energy, and telecommunication.  In most of these cases, measuring market power hinges on two key elements: (i) identification of the degree of substitution between products, and (ii) quantification of its impact on market prices. The key contribution of the proposed work to this literature is that it will provide a new set of empirical techniques to both measure degree of substitutability between products, and help better identify firms' pricing conduct in differentiated product industries.<br/><br/>On the first point, the PIs build on an important literature in the field of Industrial Organization, devoted to the identification of substitution patterns in markets for differentiated products. The main contribution of this work is to show the existence of a source of variation in the data that drives the identification of the degree of substitutability between products in standard demand models. They exploit this variation to construct parametric and non-parametric estimators of models commonly used in the literature (e.g. Berry et al. (1995), Nevo (2001)). This addresses important reserves raised by practitioners regarding the robustness of the predictions offered by existing methods (e.g.  Angrist and Pischke (2010)). On the second point, the PIs propose a novel approach to empirically estimate the supply relationship between prices and demand factors, without imposing strong and often untested assumptions. Early efforts to identify firms' conduct have relied on contrasting observed measures of pass-through of demand or cost shocks on prices and quantities, with fairly general theoretical predictions from models of competition or collusion (Bresnahan, 1989). This empirical strategy can bound the degree of market power in homogenous good industries, but cannot easily be extended to settings in which sellers supply differentiated goods and services. In contrast, researchers studying the extent of market power in differentiated product industries typically rely on more restrictive models of competition, which often eliminates entirely the possibility of testing for alternative conduct assumptions; such as perfect competition or collusion. To get around this problem the PIs generalize Bresnahan's (1987) strategy for testing for the presence of coordinated pricing to an environment with potentially rich product differentiation, allowing for a larger class of possible supply relations to determine firm conduct. This allows in turn to directly examine how firms exploit market power when setting prices, rather than assuming it in the form of stylized game theoretic models."

WSNs face significant scalability challenges due to the proliferation of emerging wide-area wireless monitoring and control systems (e.g., urban sensing, large civil infrastructure monitoring, oil field management) that require thousands of sensors be connected over long distances. Due to their short communication range, existing WSN technologies face critical challenges in terms of energy, cost, and complexity to achieve scalability in wide-area deployments. To address this limitation, this project proposes a scalable sensor network architecture - called Sensor Network Over White Spaces (SNOW) - by designing sensor networks to operate over the TV white spaces, which refer to the allocated but unused TV channels. This project will lead to a new generation of WSN that will operate over white spaces, enabling a broad range of applications that involve wide-area monitoring and control. Besides its scientific impact across multiple subareas of computer science, it will impact education, outreach, and diversity. The scientific contributions of the project will be incorporated in various computer science courses. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and hands-on experimental opportunities will attract diverse students to participate in the project including women and under-represented students. The principal investigator (PI) will leverage collaborations with industrial partners to transfer the technology to industries for future WSN mote design and also will work with standards bodies to standardize the technology to be developed in this project. <br/><br/>Since the TV transmissions are in lower frequencies (50-698 MHz), white spaces have excellent propagation characteristics over long distances. Compared to the ISM band, they are less crowded. Long range will reduce most WSNs to a single-hop structure that has potential to reduce the complexity, overhead, and latency that existing WSN technologies operating in 2.4GHz face due to multi-hop. SNOW hence can support large-scale sensor deployments over wide areas. However, most WSN applications need low data rate, low power nodes, and require scalability and energy efficiency. The SNOW architecture achieves scalability and energy efficiency through channel splitting and enabling simultaneous packet receptions with single radio. The base station is power-rich and has a single transceiver that uses available wide spectrum from white spaces. The spectrum is split into narrow subcarriers that have longer range and that consume less power. The sensor nodes transmit using their assigned sub-carriers asynchronously. The base station is able to process multiple sub-carriers simultaneously. Enabling such simultaneous receptions at a node is challenging as it requires a novel decoder design. In the SNOW architecture, this is done through Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) that provides distinct orthogonal signals. The contributions of this project will include: (1) the design of the physical layer of SNOW that includes white space spectrum splitting into narrow band subcarriers and a demodulator design that can decode simultaneous packet receptions; (2) the design of the media access control protocol for SNOW that handles subcarrier allocation among the nodes and their transmission scheduling; (3) the implementation of the SNOW architecture on a prototype hardware, and evaluation through realistic experiments."

More often than not, physical and bio-geochemical phenomena on one scale (e.g., a pore scale) affect, and are coupled to phenomena on a vastly different scale (e.g., a field scale). Such phenomena defy coarse-scale continuum descriptions, since they exhibit high localization (e.g., propagation of reactive fronts and biofilm growth) and/or strong nonlinear coupling between the processes involved (e.g., dynamic changes in porosity and permeability due to dissolution or precipitation). Hybrid numerical algorithms are to be used when coarse-scale continuum models fail to accurately describe a physical phenomenon in a small part of a computational domain. Accurate and efficient coupling of two (or more) models operating on vastly different spatial and/or temporal scales in a hybrid remains a major theoretical and computational challenge. A key to the success of a hybrid method is an efficient implementation of coupling conditions on the interface between its constitutive models. Additionally, uncertainty about pore geometry undermines the veracity of pore-scale simulations and, hence, of hybrid simulations of which they are a constitutive part. Overreaching goals of the proposed activity are to establish a theoretical foundation for hybrid modeling of subsurface flow and transport, to develop corresponding numerical algorithms, and to provide computational tools for robust uncertainty quantification in hybrid models. To achieve these goals, the investigators will develop hybrid algorithms for reactive flows in fractured and porous media, quantify uncertainty in pore-scale geometry in hybrid simulations, and experimentally validate hybrid simulations.<br/> <br/>In terms of broader impact, this proposal will enhance sustainability of essential water resources. Groundwater is a principal source of domestic water supply in the United States, and it is a major source of fresh water for industrial, agricultural and public uses.

The methods and algorithms developed in the course of the proposed activity will lay a solid foundation for improved quantitative understanding of subsurface processes with tightly coupled pore- and field-scales.

The field of complexity theory mathematically proves ""lower bounds,"" showing that no such clever program exists for (other) core problems. Intuitively, it appears that these two fields work on polar-opposite tasks. The major goal of this project is to discover counter-intuitive new connections between algorithm design and complexity theory, and to study the scientific consequences of the bridges built by these connections. It is hard to overestimate the potential impact---societal, scientific, and otherwise---of a theoretical framework which would lead to a fine-grained understanding of what computers can and cannot do. This project is focused on exploring concrete steps towards a better understanding, via studying links between the seemingly opposite tasks of algorithms and lower bounds. Another goal of the project is to bring complexity research closer to real-world computing, and to introduce practitioners to aspects of complexity that will impact their work. A final goal is educational outreach, through online forums dedicated to learning computer science, teaching summer school courses, and collaboration with the media on communicating theoretical computer science (including links between algorithms and lower bounds) to the public.<br/><br/>The PI seeks common links between algorithms and complexity: counter-intuitive similarities and bridges which will lead to greater insight into both areas. A central question in computer science is the famous P versus NP open problem, which is about the difficulty of combinatorial problems which admit short solutions. Such problems can always be solved via ?brute force?, trying all possible solutions. Can brute force always be replaced with a cleverer search method? This question is a major one; no satisfactory answers are known, and concrete answers seem far away. The conventional wisdom is that in general, brute force cannot be entirely avoided, but it is still mathematically possible that most natural search problems can be solved extremely rapidly, without any brute force. <br/><br/>Computational lower bounds are among the great scientific mysteries of our time: there are many conjectures and beliefs about them, but concrete results are few. Moreover, the theory is hampered by ?complexity barriers? which show that most known proof methods are incapable of proving strong lower bounds. The PI's long-term objective is to help discover and develop new ways of thinking that will demystify lower bounds, and elucidate the limits of possibilities of computing. The PI hypothesizes that an algorithmic perspective on lower bounds is the key: for example, earlier work of the PI shows that algorithms for the circuit satisfiability problem (which slightly beat brute force search) imply circuit complexity lower bounds. The PI has developed several new links within the past few years, and has proposed many more to be investigated. Among the various angles explored in this project, the potential scientific applications are vast, ranging from logical circuit design, to network algorithms, to improved hardware and software testing, to better nearest-neighbor search (with its own applications in computer vision, DNA sequencing, and machine learning), and to cryptography and security."

Since physical prototyping and experiments are typically costly and hard to conduct, ""virtual experiments"" in the form of modeling and simulation can dramatically accelerate innovation in CPS. Unfortunately, major technical challenges often impede the effectiveness of modeling and simulation. This project develops foundations and tools for overcoming these challenges. The project focuses on robotics as an important, archetypical class of CPS, and consists of four key tasks: 1) Compiling and analyzing a benchmark suite for modeling and simulating robots, 2) Developing a meta-theory for relating cyber-physical models, as well as tools and a test bed for robot modeling and simulation, 3) Validating the research results of the project using two state-of-the-art robot platforms that incorporate novel control technologies and will require novel programming techniques to fully realize their potential 4) Developing course materials incorporating the project's research results and test bed.<br/><br/>With the aim of accelerating innovation in a wide range of domains including stroke rehabilitation and prosthetic limbs, the project is developing new control concepts and modeling and simulation technologies for robotics. In addition to new mathematical foundations, models, and validation methods, the project will also develop software tools and systematic methods for using them. The project trains four doctoral students; develops a new course on modeling and simulation for cyber-physical systems that balances both control and programming concepts; and includes an outreach component to the public and to minority-serving K-12 programs."

Perhaps the most natural language for describing computation is that of bits, and this ""Boolean"" view predominates the field. However, many fundamental computation problems on objects such as matrices or numbers are naturally expressed in the language of algebra, which speaks of addition and multiplication over different arithmetic systems. In those settings, the number of arithmetic operations (additions, multiplications, and possibly divisions) needed to solve the problem is a good measure for the complexity of the problem. Over the years, the algebraic view of computation has wielded considerable power in the design of algorithms. Many of these algebraic algorithms drive real-world engineering; conversely, ruling out the existence of good algorithms for a problem can drive applications in fields like cryptography, and lead to more productive engineering.<br/><br/>This project will explore how algebraic methods can be understood by examining the core problems through the ""Boolean"" lens of bits, studying relationships between Boolean and algebraic complexity theory. There are subtle differences between the two theories; a major goal of this project is to iron-out these subtleties, and explore which techniques from one theory can be extended to the other. The broader impacts of the project include the design of new courses by the PI and postdoc, training graduate students, theory advocacy in the general public, and community-building activities co-organized by the PI and postdoc.<br/><br/>An important class of algorithmic techniques come from algebra, and these techniques often arise in broad, high-impact settings. However, we do not fully understand the power of the algebraic toolkit, and there are major open problems in this regard which present fundamental challenges in algebraic geometry and complexity theory. Three major research threads of this project are: (1) functional lower bounds on Boolean problems, by viewing them in an arithmetic way, (2) an algebraic analogue of the ""Natural Proofs"" barrier in Boolean complexity, searching for fundamental limitations in the present technology for reasoning about algebraic computation, and (3) new algebraic approaches for designing algorithms for fundamental problems such as Boolean Satisfiability. The thread of functional lower bounds will apply recent insights of the postdoc, characterizing a class of well-studied and interesting Boolean problems in a surprising algebraic framework. The Natural Proofs analogue will study a new notion of ""algebraic pseudorandom functions"" proposed by the PI and postdoc, understanding how certain cryptographic primitives can be viewed algebraically. The algebraic algorithm design thread will proceed from recent work of the PI on probabilistic non-interactive proof systems for refuting unsatisfiable Boolean formulas, attempting to either ""de-randomize"" the proof system or understand the obstacles involved."

In this way it is utilizing plasmonic metasurfaces as gating electrodes to engineer the quantum properties of 2D materials. This enables a new regime of strong optical coupling in hybrid plasmonic-2D systems. The gating metasurface electrodes are additionally used to periodically modulate the chemical potential of the 2D material, resulting in a quantum Bragg reflector for surface graphene plasmons - a novel concept that bridges materials science and optics. Using first-principles modeling, advanced fabrication and optical characterization, plasmonic metasurfaces are fabricated and integrated with 2D materials to create these new hybrid materials. Unique optical characteristics of this system, such as anomalously high optical nonlinearities and ultrafast response, are explored and utilized for efficient optical harmonics generation as well as in ultrafast nonlinear optical devices."

Sequencing will be done on 100 MA lines derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been assessed for performance in six natural field environments. Additional sequencing will include 40 lines from each of 8 additional sets of MA lines, established from naturally-collected founder genotypes from France and Sweden, and 50 lines from natural North American selections that have been identified to contain a unique haplotype grouping and divergence pattern of mutations similar to that found in classical MA lines.

This ability, in turn, has applications to emerging software challenges in security, software-defined networking, cyber-physical systems, and beyond.  The diversity of such applications necessitates adapting the underlying program analyses to client needs, in aspects of scalability, applicability, and accuracy.  Today's program analyses, however, do not provide useful tuning knobs.  The goal of this research is a general computer-assisted approach to effectively adapt program analyses to diverse clients.  It bridges the gap between decades of program analysis research on one hand and diverse artifacts built atop them to address emerging software challenges on the other.  In doing so, it broadens and enhances the benefits of program analysis to its users, as well as users of software whose quality is impacted by program analysis.<br/><br/>The research has three key ingredients.  First, it poses optimization problems that expose a large set of choices to adapt various aspects of a program analysis, such as its cost, the accuracy of its result, and the assumptions it makes about missing information.  Second, it solves those optimization problems by new search algorithms that efficiently navigate large search spaces, reason in the presence of noise, interact with users, and learn across programs.  Third, it builds a program analysis platform that facilitates users to specify and compose analyses, enables search algorithms to reason about analyses, and allows using large-scale computing resources to parallelize analyses.  The approach is demonstrated in the context of analyzing mobile apps -- programs that run on advanced mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Mobile apps represent an increasing use of non-expert programmers and they are likely to be used across a wide range of users in heterogeneous and demanding conditions that can benefit from what-if analyses that program analysis can offer."

Antibodies are attractive as therapeutic agents due to their specificity, but despite their growing medicinal importance, development and characterization of new antibodies is arduous and expensive.  This work aims to simplify antibody development by capturing only the strongest-binding natural antibodies from a mixture and then sequencing these antibodies to enable their synthesis for future investigations or applications.  These studies will also develop methods to identify antibody modifications for quality control.  The project will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Additionally, incorporation of research concepts, advanced mass spectrometry, and surface analysis techniques into the undergraduate and particularly graduate curricula is planned.  A workshop for high school teachers will focus on protein analysis by MS to further expand the impact of this effort, while internships for minority undergraduate and high school students should contribute to increasing the number of underrepresented students entering the research pipeline.<br/><br/>Technically, this project explores membrane-based antibody digestion to control the size of proteolytic peptides and enhance both characterization and sequencing of antibodies using mass spectrometry (MS).  Immobilization of proteases such as pepsin in the pores of membranes creates enzymatic reactors, and because protease-containing membranes are only 100 microns thick, high flow rates through membranes give msec digestion times.  The research examines whether combining large peptides from msec digestions and small peptides from longer digestions facilitates detection of protein modifications, determination of the location of these modifications, and arrangement of peptides for protein sequencing.  Unlike other digestion methods, membrane-based digestion yields long and short peptides with the same enzyme so the molecular masses of short peptides add to give the masses of long peptides.  This should lead to a unique and effective method for arranging peptides in a protein sequence based on the relationships between masses of these large and small peptides.  Subsequent MS/MS analysis of large and small peptides is expected to give almost complete amino acid coverage for the antibody sequence.  Moreover, the large peptides from inexpensive digestion with pepsin-modified membranes will facilitate characterization of antibody oxidation, glycosylation, and deamidation, even in mixtures. Importantly, digestion in pepsin-containing membranes is inexpensive and occurs at low pH to minimize antibody degradation. These studies will also examine whether porous membranes containing antigens can isolate a few tight- or rapid-binding antibodies from a polyclonal mixture.  Compared to bead-based methods for isolation, membranes offer lower dead volume, less non-specific adsorption, and finer control of binding times and rinsing to potentially facilitate rapid identification of a few antibodies from a polyclonal mixture.  Subsequent sequencing will enable antibody synthesis and application.  Thus, the techniques explored in this research may eventually lead to methods for discovering and sequencing antibodies from immunized or infected animals."

Systems of this type arise in applications ranging from distributed power generation, to coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles and deployment of teams of robotic agents, to control of fluid flows around wind turbines and vehicles, to control of segmented mirrors in extremely large telescopes. One of the major challenges in systems with large number of degrees of freedom is the development of analytical and computational methods for their tractable analysis and design.<br/><br/>Interactions between subsystems often induce complex dynamical responses that cannot be predicted by analyzing subsystems in isolation. Blackouts in power networks, congestion in transportation networks, spatio-temporal oscillations in biochemical networks, turbulence in fluid flows, and the spread of information in social networks illustrate the complex and seemingly unpredictable behavior that arises in systems of high dynamical order. The broader impacts of the proposed work range from improved performance and suppression of blackouts in power systems to systematic design of sensor networks and multi-agent systems. The educational aspect of the proposal is to develop a new introductory course on analysis and design of networks. This course will be aimed at attracting students from diverse engineering departments at senior undergraduate and first year graduate levels.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit lies in the development of theory and techniques for structure identification and optimal design of large networks of dynamical systems. The PI will combine tools and ideas from control theory, optimization, and compressive sensing to achieve an optimal tradeoff between network performance and controller sparsity. The proposed approach involves both structure identification and structured optimal design steps. In the structure identification step, sparsity will be induced by regularizing an optimal control problem with a penalty on communication requirements in the distributed controller. In contrast to previous efforts, this penalty will reflect the fact that sparsity should be enforced in a specific set of coordinates. After having identified a controller structure, the structured optimal design step will optimize the network performance over the identified structure. Alongside the sparse feedback synthesis, the PI will address the critical question of optimal sensor and actuator selection in large-scale networks.<br/><br/>Although, in general, finding the solution to this problem requires an intractable combinatorial search, this award will draw upon recent developments in sparse representations to cast it as a semidefinite program (SDP).

Such customized solvers will be capable of dealing with large problems.<br/>that general-purpose solvers are not able to handle."

Dissipation of kinetic energy by turbulent flow around airplanes, ships, and submarines increases resistance to their motion (drag); about half of the fuel required to maintain the aircraft at cruise conditions is used to overcome the drag force imposed by the turbulent flow. Similarly, in wind farms, turbulence reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades, thereby decreasing the energy capture. Understanding and controlling turbulent fluid flows plays an important role in these applications, and may critically impact US economy, national security, and the environment. The broader impacts of this award range from economic and environmental benefits to improved performance of wind farms, transporting pipes, and vehicles. The Principle Investigators (PIs) plan to organize a workshop on modeling and control of fluids at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications. This workshop will be aimed at showcasing utility of control engineering and systems theory to an interdisciplinary audience of students, researchers, and professionals from the engineering, mathematics, and physics communities.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project's effort lies in the novelty and interdisciplinary nature of the research. Second-order statistics of turbulent flows can be obtained either experimentally or via numerical simulations. The statistics are relevant in understanding fundamentals of flow physics and for the development of low-complexity models. Such models will be used for control design in order to suppress turbulence. Due to experimental or numerical limitations it is often the case that only certain spatio-temporal correlations between a limited numbers of flow field components are available. Thus, it is of interest to complete the statistical signature of the flow field in a way that is consistent with the known dynamics. The approach to this inverse problem relies on a model governed by stochastically forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Here, the statistics of forcing are unknown and sought to explain the given correlations. Identifying suitable stochastic forcing will allow the PIs to complete the correlation data of the velocity field. While the system dynamics impose a linear constraint on the admissible correlations, such an inverse problem admits many solutions for the forcing correlations. The PIs will use nuclear norm minimization to obtain correlation structures of low complexity. This complexity translates into dimensionality of spatio-temporal filters that will be used to generate the identified forcing statistics."

It is now known that this change in stiffness can drive disease by causing cells within the tissue to adopt unhealthy behaviors.  However, tissues do not stiffen uniformly.  The tissues can develop numerous small foci of stiffness so that the stiffness varies markedly throughout. It is not yet known how cells respond to these distributed foci of stiffness that develop with age and disease.  This award supports the research necessary to understand how the process of aging contributes to the development of stiffness foci and how these stiff foci alter cell function.   The primary activity in this work will be on the development of mechanical stiffness foci within blood vessels and the evaluation of their effects on the cells within the blood vessel wall.  However, this basic research will have a broad impact on current understanding of physiology and pathology throughout the body, as changes in tissue stiffness with age can occur in multiple different organ systems.  As such, this work will have broad impact to society.  The project involves techniques from cell biology, materials science, optics, and microfabrication.   This multi-disciplinary approach coupled with research activities designed to involve diverse sets of researchers and students will help train engineers to think and work across disciplinary boundaries.<br/><br/>While ""heterogeneity"" is now appreciated as an important component of biology, the primary focus to-date has been on cell-to-cell molecular-level heterogeneities.

This project will address the stiffness foci that develop in tissue and their effects on cell-cell adhesion and force generation. In this project, the major research goal is to characterize these foci and their biophysical effects on endothelial cell-cell adhesion using state-of-the-art tools including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), microfabrication, and ex vivo models.  These studies have the potential to identify a novel mechanism by which age contributes to endothelial dysfunction. More importantly, this work will bring to light the role of mechanical heterogeneities within the matrix on cell biophysics. While the research here will be on the endothelium, it is expected that the results will be relevant to many tissues and pathologies including cancer and embryonic development where heterogeneities in mechanical properties also exist."

CC-MIPs include quality of service or reliability constraints; they are dynamic, contain uncertain data, and involve discrete decisions. The resulting multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programs are challenging both theoretically and computationally. The service level requirements are modeled with joint chance constraints, which are non-convex. In addition, the deterministic equivalents of CC-MIPs are very large-scale MIPs. To overcome these challenges, this research aims to develop a unified theory and computational methodology, utilizing extended formulations, polyhedral combinatorics, and decomposition algorithms.

Communications, navigation and energy production and distribution can be significantly affected by this space weather. The ability to forecast disturbances that may impact these technologies hinges upon detailed knowledge and understanding of the connected Sun-Earth system, including complicated coupling processes between the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A particular aspect of the latter is patches and arcs of auroral emissions observed in the polar cap. Some recent studies suggest that these structures, originating on the dayside, can drift across the polar cap and play a role in the creation and dynamics of space weather disturbances in the nightside ionosphere.    Determining the precise nature of these polar cap structures and their relation to other dynamic features in the nightside ionosphere and magnetosphere is the main objective of this project.  It will be attempted through a comprehensive analysis of simultaneous observations of the relevant phenomena from a variety of sources.  The resulting understanding constitutes a critical step towards being able to include this effect in ionospheric space weather specification and forecast models.   A graduate student will be trained as part of the research effort. <br/><br/>This project aims to determine the properties of polar cap patches and arcs and their statistical association with auroral intensifications (PBIs) and streamers. Airglow 630.0 nm imagers will be used to track polar cap structures and determine the fraction of PBIs that are preceded by polar cap patches, and the fraction of polar cap patches that lead to PBIs. The properties of the polar cap patches/arcs such as size and speed will be determined with radar measurements, and the corresponding lobe measurements (flow, particle, FAC structure) determined with conjugate spacecraft.   Specific project goals for the research effort include: (1) Establishing the airglow/arc-PBI connection statistically, (2) Determining the properties of the meso-scale structures in the polar cap, and (3) Establishing the possible magnetospheric counterpart for the ionospheric flow channels."

Membranes used in water treatment processes are exposed to feed waters containing organic, inorganic, and biological species, which leads to fouling and loss of membrane productivity over time. Since performance loss due to fouling is one of the largest costs associated with membrane processes in water treatment, discovery of new surface treatments that limit fouling would have significant economic and societal impacts. Fouling propensity of a membrane depends greatly on its surface properties such as chemistry and morphology. The goal of this project is to develop the multiscale mathematical framework to predict fouling behavior on the surfaces of membranes with different geometric patterns and chemical coatings. The ability to predict fouling properties of new membrane surfaces in silico will accelerate the discovery of novel membrane designs and decrease the time from laboratory to market. <br/><br/>In this project, comprehensive studies involving iterative feedback between computational modeling and experimental measurements will be performed to test two main hypotheses: (1) targeted combinations of geometric and chemical patterns on a membrane surface will significantly reduce membrane fouling, and (2) experimentally-trained multiscale computational models will accelerate the discovery of novel geometric and chemical surface modifications that significantly reduce membrane fouling. This research will (i) produce a mathematical framework and corresponding models to identify the physical mechanisms and geometric features controlling mass and momentum transfer through and over micro- and nanopatterned membranes, (ii) provide a deep understanding of how foulants and energy fluxes are controlled and regulated by complex topologies, and (iii) elucidate how the macroscopic behavior of filtration flow rates and reactive transport processes are coupled with phenomena at the micro- and nano-scale. This work will be transformational because delivering an experimentally-validated computational framework will enable rapid screening of many membrane surface modifications to short-list the most promising ones for further testing, and it will lead to a leapfrog improvement in membrane filtration technologies. This project will provide a multidisciplinary environment for training graduate and undergraduate researchers. New communication platforms such as Zoom video conferencing will be used to deliver virtual science demonstrations and laboratory tours to elementary school."

In living cells, proteins typically assemble into macromolecular complexes in order to perform targeted tasks. Knowing the location and exact composition of protein assemblies enables investigators to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity during key cellular events such as division or movement. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the composition of such complexes in living cells, and it is clear that composition can vary depending on the cellular environment. This project will develop an optical/computational method to count subunits in protein assemblies in living cells, and enable exceptionally detailed information to be gathered about biological processes in native, non-invasive environments. This project combines expertise from the biological, mathematical, and physical sciences and as such provides exceptional interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and postdocs. Moreover, the project will yield methods that will have broad applicability in the optical biological sciences.<br/><br/>This project will extract protein complex stoichiometry directly from the superresolution microscopy technique called PALM (PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy). PALM works by genetically encoding proteins of interest with photoswitchable fluorescing protein (FP) tags. Under sufficiently low light, each FP photoactivates and subsequently photobleaches. Thus, the number of fluorescence spikes over one small region of space should coincide with the number of protein subunits confined to that region (and normally confined to a specific protein complex). In practice, FPs fluoresce on and off (i.e. they 'blink') with blinking properties dependent on the local cellular environment. This blinking has been a major challenge in using PALM as a quantitative tool. The project will adapt the mathematical and statistical inference tools used in the analysis of ion channel patch clamp experiments to determine protein complex stoichiometry directly from PALM data (Goal 1). To determine the complex stoichiometry more accurately, the FP's blinking properties will be simultaneously extracted while determining the complex stoichiometry (Goal 2). The method will be tested on synthetic as well as real data sets where the protein complex stoichiometry is already known. The analysis will then be extended to protein complexes where the stoichiometry is still under current investigation (SpoIIIE and the kinetochore). If successful, this counting method will have several decisive advantages over existing counting methods, which assume specific FP photophysical properties or do not treat FP properties stochastically.<br/><br/><br/>This grant is funded jointly by the Cellular Dynamics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics."

This project implements a field experiment with full-time manufacturing workers over a one-month period to test whether relative pay comparisons affect effort and labor supply. Measuring the extent to which individuals care about the wages of their co-workers has potentially broad implications for wage structure. If wage inequality reduces effort or labor supply, this can generate wage compression (differences in wage that are much smaller than differences in productivity) and wage rigidity (wages that do not adjust to market conditions). Relative pay comparisons also have implications for the organization of labor markets and firm boundaries. <br/><br/>In the experiment, workers perform individual production tasks, but are organized into distinct teams, defined by the type of product they produce. Teams are randomized to receive either compressed wages (where all workers earn the same daily wage, drawn randomly from one of three wage levels) or heterogeneous wages (where each team member is paid a different wage according to his baseline productivity ranking). If pay inequality decreases morale, then holding own wage fixed, a worker will reduce output when his co-workers are paid more than himself. In addition, this study explores the conditions under which unequal pay affects morale. First, the design induces variation in the perceived fairness of pay differences: production tasks differ in the extent to which co-worker output is observable. Second, it induces random variation in actual fairness: the fixed pay differences between co-workers are less fair when a worker is close in baseline productivity to his higher paid peers."

For instance, the research explores recursive formulations for metrics at the bottom of the hierarchy, and additional proofs are pursued to determine why practical constraints, such as correlations in reliability, break the structure of the problem into exponential time algorithms.

Though space weather research over the past decade or so has greatly increased understanding of a wide variety of phenomena associated with the ITM physics, the sum of these individual processes occurring in Geospace does not replicate the rich diversity and scope of this complex region. Thus a more holistic approach to the ITM research is necessary, one that integrates clustered instrumentation at multiple locations to have a simultaneous look at the solar wind interactions within the entire Geospace system. This project will support studies of interrelated ITM phenomena observed at high latitudes through the coordinated and collaborative instruments deployed across Antarctica. Specifically, the project will focus on continued operation of a suite of geospace instrumentation currently deployed at both the South Pole (SPA) and McMurdo (MCM) stations. This suite has a sustained track-record of robust operation and community support: ground-based fluxgate and search-coils magnetometers, ELF and VLF receivers, imaging and broadband riometers, sky-looking optical systems, scintillation GPS receivers, and a number of other instruments. Data from this suite will be synergistically combined to study: (a) synoptic variability of the magnetospheric open-closed boundary (OCB) and associated cusp structures (utilizing fluxgate, photometer, and all-sky imager data); (b) simultaneous ELF whistler events at SPA and MCM and their relationship to ionospheric conditions (using ELF receiver, fluxgate, and GPS data); and (c) auroral and polar cap GPS signal scintillation occurrence, strength, and relationship with the ITM activity (using GPS, fluxgate, riometer, imager, ELF/VLF data). These particular topics are only a partial listing of the work that can, and will, be performed with the data obtained from these instruments, especially via established and planned collaborations with other geospace projects taking place in the Antarctica and at magnetically conjugate regions in the Arctic. These include (but not limit) the MCM lidar system, southern hemisphere SuperDARN radars, Fabry-Perot interferometers, balloon campaign, etc. The project will be utilizing (and also providing) data from/to in-orbit satellites, namely the THEMIS suite of spacecraft and recently launched RBSP spacecraft. This will make use of the ground- and space-based data to provide the science context to proposed observations and reveal new insights into underlying physics of the geospace phenomena.

Tor is a technology that every day helps millions of people protect their privacy online. Tor users -- ranging from ordinary citizens to companies with valuable intellectual property -- gain protection for the content of their online messages and activities, as well as whom they interact with and when. For the most part, Tor is very secure. However, it has a known vulnerability to an attack called website fingerprinting. An attacker, such as someone eavesdropping on a wireless connection, can analyze recognizable patterns in data that websites send to visitors, potentially determining which websites a user visits. Studies have shown that, in some situations, this attack can be successful up to 90% of the time. Developers of Tor and a team of researchers will collaborate to build and deploy new defenses against website fingerprinting, which substantially lower attack accuracy without degrading user experience or increasing the costs of running the system. By widely deploying such a defense, Tor's security is greatly improved. This also provides an experimental platform and data that other researchers can use for their own experiments, helping to further strengthen Tor.<br/><br/>Previous approaches to defending against website fingerprinting increased latency, so that web pages load 2 to 4 times slower than normal. To design an effective defense that doesn't unacceptably slow browsing or increase bandwidth overhead, this project builds on a technique called Adaptive Padding, which has shown promising results in preliminary work. Adaptive Padding works by noticing distinctive gaps in data packets flowing over the network between a website and Tor user and filling these gaps with extra packets to obfuscate the website's fingerprint. The research team first developed a platform for evaluating Adaptive Padding and other defenses in Tor, allowing security experiments in the live Tor network without full deployment or endangering user privacy. Leveraging this platform, the team performs extensive experiments on website fingerprinting defenses and attacks, leading towards deployment. The project focuses on defenses that can be practically deployed and significantly improve user security. Since defenses meeting these requirements have been understudied to date, this project enhances knowledge in this area. Finally, the findings of the project are fully transitioned to Tor to make Internet browsing safer and more secure."

GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. Over the past two decades, social science research has found that girls and women encounter barriers in STEM education and then face additional obstacles entering and advancing in STEM careers. Yet, the effects of motherhood and fatherhood on the careers of STEM professionals are not well studied. This research will explore whether parenting--especially motherhood--incurs penalties in STEM employment in terms of retention, advancement, and salary. Using a sociological theoretical perspective that socially structured life courses move through gendered institutions, the study will examine how parenthood shapes career trajectories, retention, and salaries for women and men in STEM fields. The proposed empirical research project will use representative, longitudinal data to analyze these parenthood effects among STEM professionals. The researchers will also investigate how these parenthood effects differ by race/ethnicity, education level, sector, and STEM field.

Holman<br/>Proposal Number:  1509687/ 1509864<br/><br/>The sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth.  Currently, solar cells based on crystalline silicon materials dominate the photovoltaics market for production of electricity from the sun because they offer the highest solar energy conversion efficiency at the lowest manufacturing cost.  However, to accelerate the penetration of solar energy in the renewable electricity market, the solar energy conversion efficiency of silicon-based solar cells must ultimately increase beyond its practical limit of 24%.  The goal of this project is develop a silicon-based solar cell which contains Group III and V elements from the Periodic Table, arranged in layers which have the potential to increase the solar energy conversion efficiency to 30%.  The fundamental science underlying the performance of this the III-V/silicon tandem cell will be used to develop the best strategy for eventual manufacture.   As part of the educational activities of this project, the principal investigators will be actively involved in an outreach program that seeks to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in engineering by using solar research as a platform for involvement in both technical and career-development sessions at Veterans meetings and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers conference.<br/><br/>Photovoltaic devices that contain multiple p-n junctions are currently the only route to achieve solar energy conversion efficiencies that exceed the Shockley-Queisser single p-n junction limit that caps the theoretical performance of crystalline silicon solar cells currently in commercial use.  The overall goal of this proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of two-terminal tandem solar cell performance through controlled growth of Group III-V elements on silicon. The fabrication strategy is guided by fundamental studies and is designed to optimize the material and device architecture to achieve 30% solar energy conversion efficiency, which is beyond the 24% practical limit of single-junction crystalline silicon solar cells. Towards this end, the model Group III-V material selected for study is GaAsP, since it has a direct and tunable bandgap, and can be grown on a transparent, compositionally graded buffer on a GaP/Si template. The bottom cell of the tandem device will be based on an amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell, where the front amorphous silicon layers will be replaced with the GaP template layer upon which the top cell is grown.  The research plan has three objectives. The first objective is to understand and control the formation of threading dislocations in the GaAsP absorber, and to develop optimized window and back-surface field layers for the top cell that will both increase transmission into the GaAsP absorber and reduce surface recombination. The second objective is to understand and improve the passivation of GaP on silicon and the transport of electrons across the conduction band offset.  The third objective is to maximize the conversion of infrared light into current in the bottom cell by designing single-side light-trapping textures and dielectric/metal rear reflectors, and then tune the thicknesses, doping densities, and bandgaps of the III-V supporting layers to both form a recombination junction between the sub-cells and match their currents. The research outcomes will advance fundamental scientific understanding of multi-junction solar cell performance while developing fabrication strategies that will enable for scalable industrial manufacture of devices potentially capable of delivering 30% solar energy conversion efficiency.  The principal investigators will also use the research outcomes to enhance instructional materials in photovoltaics course offerings at Yale University and Arizona State University."

From an elementary perspective, translation surfaces can be viewed as a polygon with a recipe for gluing its edges.  For example, gluing opposite sides of a square produces a torus, which is the mathematical name for the shape of a doughnut.  Most spectacularly, these polygons quickly lead to deep mathematics at the frontiers of research and they intersect a wide range of fields including algebra, geometry, and dynamical systems.  Furthermore, translation surfaces have started to appear in mathematical physics with connections to quantum mechanics.  From an educational standpoint, polygons arise in high school geometry and the PI has successfully explained to high school students how to find periodic trajectories of a ball on a rectangular table, using standard reflecting rules, using translation surfaces.  The elementary nature of polygons allows undergraduates to meaningfully experiment with them using software, such as Sage, which is open source software that is freely available on the internet.  The PI has already developed projects for undergraduates concerning translation surfaces.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are threefold.  First, the PI will study the geometry of orbit closures of translation surfaces through classification problems.  Secondly, the PI will apply his knowledge of the geometry of orbit closures to resolve questions concerning dynamics in moduli space and on translation surfaces.

Similarly, 3D printing at the micro-scale (from 0.001 to 0.1 millimeters in size) has the potential to revolutionize the way that biological and chemical sensors and integrated circuits are prototyped and manufactured. 3D printers build up complex parts by depositing one thin layer of material at a time. Electrohydrodynamic jet, or e-jet, printing is a promising micro-scale version of this process. This project will add sensors to a standard e-jet printer, and apply an innovative control law to greatly improve the precision of the resulting parts. The control law is based on the observation that 3D printed features typically change very little from one layer to the next. By observing how a layer deviates from its desired shape, the baseline e-jet control can be modified to improve the accuracy of the next layer. In this project, an atomic force microscope will be integrated with an e-jet printer to measure the shape of each layer. To better correct the printing process, the electric field around each layer will also be measured. The technical research plan is integrated with educational outreach to initiate undergraduate ""micro-maker"" clubs and catalyze an open-source, bottom-up movement based on inexpensive ink-jet printing of custom microcircuits and sensors.<br/><br/>Micro-scale Additive Manufacturing, and in particular, electrohydrodynamic jet printing, has the potential to revolutionize 3D, functional, micro-scale device fabrication. Limiting this step change in manufacturing capabilities is the reliance of micro-scale Additive Manufacturing systems on a process monitoring, regulation, and quality control paradigm that is performed post-process and in an ad hoc manner. This research will break this open-loop paradigm by generating fundamental scientific knowledge in two areas: 1) the synthesis of a controls theoretic framework to compensate for spatial disturbances with a robust and computationally efficient learning-based algorithm and 2) the study of interactions between charged jets of materials and substrates in electrohydrodynamic jet printing using first principles physics models and validated by empirical studies leveraging a novel integration of electrohydrodynamic jet printing and atomic force microscopy. This research will contribute the fundamental knowledge required to transform 3D micro-scale Additive Manufacturing from a nascent, open-loop and ad hoc technology set to a fully automated, accurate, and robust closed-loop system."

Of the 22 species that are currently recognized, all are considered at least Threatened or Near-Threatened, and 9 are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Because of the decline in albatross populations and the birds' role as a top predator in the pelagic ecosystem, it is vitally important to understand the factors affecting the population dynamics of these birds to better inform strategies for conservation and mitigating environmental change. The goal of this project is to answer the question: What are the population consequences of albatross bioenergetics and foraging strategies? The investigators will take a two pronged approach: 1) constructing, parameterizing, and validating an Individual Based Model (IBM) that rests on Dynamic Energy Budget theory and state dependent foraging theory; and 2) undertaking an in-depth meta-analysis of existing individual tracking and life history data from multiple albatross species across successive life stages. This theoretical work will be grounded with a unique and extensive data set on albatrosses provided by collaborator Richard Phillips from the British Antarctic Survey. The IBM approach will incorporate details such as adult energetic state, chick needs and energetics, reproductive stage, and spatial and temporal variation in prey availability within a single framework. This facilitates exploration of emergent patterns, allowing the investigators to explicitly link behavior, energetic, and population dynamics.<br/><br/>Bioenergetics constrain a variety of behaviors. A more complete understanding of how individuals use energy can give insight into how behaviors from foraging to breeding and survival, and resulting population attributes, might change with environmental factors, due to anthropogenic and other drivers. This work will further a general understanding of how bioenergetics shapes behavior and drives population level processes, while providing an approach that can be used to guide conservation strategies for endangered populations. The research findings and activities will be made accessible to public audiences through websites and on a blog maintained for the project by a postdoctoral researcher. The project will involve undergraduate and high school researchers in the project, within formal laboratory groups and also through in-classroom presentations and activities. This project also involves outreach to local elementary schools, as the albatross-Antarctic bioenergetics system provides a charismatic and tangible teaching tool, for exploring a complex conservation issue, and demonstrating the utility of quantitative biological research approaches. All project publications will be open access, the resulting open source software will be released to the public, and metadata and analyses will be fully documented and made available through the Knowledge Network for Biodiversity, to promote further collaborative exploration of this system."

This long-term vision has broad implications for healthcare; the way in which surgeons replace diseased and damaged tissue could be forever transformed.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a study on the dynamics of material delivery in an endoscopic 3D printer, a necessary step to realize this vision. This award also supports an innovative program for high school students to design an assistive device for patients with a specific ambulation disability.  <br/><br/>An endoscopic 3D printer is composed of a rod-like end-effector (to deliver a fluid-phase material through a ""keyhole"" surgical site) and a chain of kinematic elements (to position this end-effector).  With this form-factor, an endoscopic 3D printer will have dynamic coupling between the positioning and material delivery sub-systems of the end-effector (not observed in a standard 3D printer), and a higher fluidic resistance in the material delivery sub-system than a standard 3D printer.  The first research objective is to establish the analytic input-output relationship for the end-effector and compare the output value to a computational model.  To achieve this objective, the established Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model for non-Newtonian colloidal fluids will be used to describe the material while geometric constraints and boundary conditions relevant to an endoscopic 3D printer end-effector will be imposed.  The output (flowrate) prediction from the input-output relationship will be compared to the predicted output value from a multi-physics computational model.  The second objective is to test the hypothesis that the output rise time of a two-degree-of-freedom material delivery actuator (designed to mitigate the higher fluidic resistance) will be significantly lower than the output rise time of a nominal material delivery actuator.  This hypothesis will be tested by experiments. The output rise time for the two different material delivery actuators will be measured by machine vision under dynamic flowrate references.  The third objective is to establish the input-output relationships of the complete endoscopic 3D printer and compare outputs values to an experiment.  To achieve this objective, a quasi-static kinematic model will be used to describe the serial chain of kinematic elements, which will then be coupled with the end-effector input-output relationship established in objectives one and two.  Multiple output predictions (six positions and one flowrate) from the input-output relationships will be compared to measured values from experiments performed on a prototype endoscopic 3D printer."

This project addresses the effect of students' social identity on learning, an important factor in math and science education. Specifically, it will advance the scientific understanding of math identity (i.e. ""I'm (not) a math person"") by studying the over 100,000 diverse students who use Reasoning Mind, a blended learning system for K-8 mathematics with demonstrated results. Reasoning Mind supports math identity with an innovative design that allows students to email an animated character (aka the Genie) and receive a human-crafted response. This study will show how math identity manifests and changes during students' use of Reasoning Mind in order to inform software designers and classroom teachers on best practices for encouraging math identity. This will have the broader impact of strengthening our nation's ability to supply science and technology fields with a well-trained workforce.<br/><br/>This study examines two components of math identity: self-efficacy and interest in mathematics. Both self-efficacy and interest can be enhanced by curricula that are individualized to appropriately challenge each student (a strength of educational technology), but social stereotypes (i.e. ""Girls aren't good in math"") may decrease math identity or otherwise interfere with its development. This study investigates how educational technology can reverse these trends. In the first phase of this study, a combination of survey methods, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques will be used to identify how poor and/or changing math identity emerges in the linguistic patterns of student interaction with GenieMail (as well as in other parts of Reasoning Mind). These findings will then be used to enhance GenieMail and other instructional interactions with the Reasoning Mind system by creating a hybrid human/AI system, with the goal of improving math identity across diverse populations of students."

However, most of the current information network studies ignore the social factors involved and treat people and their interactions simply as nodes and links in graphs.  This project provides a systematic approach for analyzing such networks that addresses human factor-related questions, recognizing that different types of links have different relevance to a particular question.  For example, a ""mentor"" link might be much more relevant to recommending someone to apply for a particular job rather than see a certain movie.  This project identifies five fundamental research problems and provides solutions to these problems in heterogeneous social information networks: (1) predicting missing user and link characteristics, (2) identifying personality traits, (3) role detection, (4) prediction of social activities, and (5) recommender systems. Together these provide a way to include social understanding in analysis of networks.<br/><br/>The basic approach is to provide probabilistic models that can (1) incorporate guidance in terms of either limited labels or heuristics from domain experts, and (2) automatically select the most critical information in complicated heterogeneous information networks for the target problem. For example, for the user profiling problem of age group prediction, a probabilistic model is designed via defining the probability of a possible label configuration given the network structure and strengths on different types of links.  The derived learning algorithm will propagate the labels from only a few users via different types of links, and the strength of each link type will be learned according to the configuration probability of labels on that link type. The intuition is that if  the ""classmates"" link type brings two users with similar age together, the algorithm needs to assign the same age group label to the two connected users that are classmates and assigns a higher strength weight to the ""classmates"" link type. The project will develop an integrated network mining system based on Spark and GraphX, to support the proposed algorithms on large-scale networks. This system will be used as a research vehicle for exploring efficient approximations with quality guarantees for the proposed algorithms."

Such test errors lead to delays, additional clinical evaluation, additional expense, and sometimes to erroneous treatments that increase risk to patients.  One recent study suggests that errors in measured total blood calcium concentration due to instrument mis-calibration alone cost from $60M to $199M annually in the US. However, the vast majority of clinical laboratory errors do not originate in instrument mis-calibration. Clinical laboratory errors affect about 0.5% of samples collected.  Of those, approximately 75% of clinical laboratory test errors originate during sample collection, transport, and storage before samples reach the analysis instruments i.e., the pre-analytic phase.  However the quality control measures standard in hospital clinical test labs only monitor instrument calibration and are therefore completely blind to sample faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase, where most errors originate.  Data derived from patient samples, rather than instrumentation calibration checks, holds the key to detect faults introduced in the pre-analytic phase.  Current methods are either so insensitive to errors that they do not detect sample faults reliably, or they routinely flag normal samples as being faulty.<br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers  from Oregon Health and Science University and Northeastern University with expertise in machine learning, signal processing, and laboratory medicine to develop and apply statistical machine learning technology to reliably detect errors in hospital clinical laboratory tests, using data derived from patient samples.  The primary obstacle to developing reliable statistical detectors for lab errors is the cost of labeling samples combined with the low error rate.  Developing and evaluating any automated error-detection algorithm requires a sufficient number of samples, both faulty and non-faulty. Determining which tests are faulty requires review of the tests and other patient data (e.g. charts) by a clinical lab expert - a time-consuming and economically unfeasible prospect given the low fault rate.  The project addresses this challenge through active learning paradigms used to select, with emphasis on rare classes, subsets of the data for labeling by human experts.  The project focuses on chronic kidney disease because of its medical importance and large data repository at Oregon Health and Science University. This research will provide algorithms for clinical lab error detection that will extend to tests used in other disease entities (for example diabetes and heart failure).  <br/><br/>Ultimately, the error-detection algorithms developed from this research will make their way into clinical laboratory information systems and further into commercialization and thus deployment on a scale significant enough to have widespread positive impact on laboratory costs patient risk.

Specifically, it examines the development of the cultural stereotype that links males but not females with intellectual brilliance and genius. Previous research has found that academic disciplines that are believed to require a ""spark of genius"" tend to have the largest gender gaps. Because many science fields are portrayed in such terms, the ""brilliance = males"" stereotype may be an important factor in explaining the persistent gender gap in these disciplines. The primary goal of this research is understanding how this stereotype is acquired over the course of development.  Investigating the development of this stereotype will inform how the stereotype might steer capable young women away from pursuing careers in science and technology and may also inform the optimal timing of potential interventions to block its adverse effects. <br/><br/>This project consists of three studies to examine three crucial developmental issues. First, it investigates the development of children's knowledge of the cultural stereotype that males are more likely to be brilliant than females. Second, it investigates the development of gender differences in children's motivation to engage in activities portrayed as requiring high levels of intellectual aptitude. Finally, it investigates longitudinally whether internalizing the stereotype against females' intellectual abilities undermines young girls' subsequent motivation to engage in activities that are said to require brilliance and giftedness. This research explores the development of a set of processes that ultimately limit opportunities for women. As such, these studies will improve parents', educators', and policy-makers' ability to intervene at the root of the problem to promote greater gender equity in those domains of academia and industry in which women have traditionally been underrepresented.<br/><br/>This proposal is being co-funded by Developmental and Learning Sciences, Social Psychology, and Science of Broadening Participation within the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and by the Education and Human Resources Directorate's Core Research program and the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering program."

This research project aims to develop novel ideas and algorithms for the model reduction of such systems. The investigator will develop automatic learning algorithms that, by collecting a number of short simulations in parallel, output a much lower-dimensional model of the original system that yields faster simulations, with provable accuracy, in a much reduced number of variables. This will make the simulations less expensive, allowing one to perform more and longer simulations, and make the extraction of useful information from simulated data easier. He will apply these constructions to molecular dynamics simulations, expecting to significantly reduce the computational time needed to simulate small biomolecules.<br/><br/>Large data sets in high dimensional spaces appear in a wide variety of scientific fields and applications. The PI focuses here on data sets that originate from the simulation of high-dimensional stochastic systems that arise in a wide variety of applications (e.g. molecular dynamics), with the goal of producing a much lower dimensional stochastic system with similar statistical properties as the full system, at least at a certain time scale. This is possible for a wide variety of dynamical systems with separation of time scales when the structure of the forces acting on the system and the stochastic perturbations are such that the trajectories of the system accumulate, in state or phase space, around low-dimensional sets (at the appropriate time scale and accuracy). The approach only requires access to a simulator S for the original system that, given initial conditions and the shortest time scale of interest as inputs, produces as output a (stochastic) path of the system starting at that initial condition and stops at the specified time. A call to S is typically expensive, but after a small number of carefully designed calls that yield a relatively small number of short paths, the algorithm learns and outputs a low-dimensional representation of the system, that is, a low-dimensional stochastic system whose trajectories are (in a suitable statistical sense), at the requested time scale, close to those of the original system. This construction may be performed in an online setting, as new regions of state space are explored, and in a multiscale fashion, where the time scale at which the system is reduced varies. These techniques will be adaptive to the assumed low intrinsic dimension of the simulated data, the timescale of interest, and the accuracy, leading to a new generation of results and algorithms for learning and approximating high-dimensional stochastic systems. While the techniques to be developed are applicable to a large family of stochastic systems, the main application considered in this project is Molecular Dynamics (MD). These techniques are expected to dramatically speed up the exploration of the state space of these molecules and of MD simulations as a whole. At the same time, they are general enough that they are applicable to a wide variety of stochastic systems, and the framework sets the stage for a novel approach to automatic learning of dynamical systems that is amenable to further generalizations."

The new production conceptual model has been a powerful organizing principle in biological oceanography and provides a means to constrain the amount of primary production that may be exported or ""sequestered"" from the system. Despite qualifications to the definitions of new and regenerated forms of N as originally articulated, the concept has, for the most part, been narrowly applied, specifying nitrate as the primary form of new N, and ammonium as the predominant recycled form. Evidence continues to accumulate that these definitions may warrant expansion. N fixation can be at times a substantial source of new N; similarly, forms of dissolved organic N (e.g., urea) may contribute significantly to recycled production, but the specific organisms taking part in these transformations are still uncertain.  Nitrification in the upper water column may also compromise the strict definitions of new and recycled N. Scientists can now probe more deeply into new and regenerated production, and directly identify major agents of these processes using new molecular techniques. This project will quantify new and regenerated production in a coastal ecosystem, illuminating the predominant compounds involved. Rates of primary production, nitrate, ammonium and urea assimilation, N2 fixation, and nitrification will be determined in the upper water column in concert with monthly SPOT cruises. In tandem, two stable isotope probing (SIP) approaches (conventional SIP for nitrate, ammonium and urea uptake coupled to high throughput sequencing and microarray based Chip-SIP for N2 fixation) will be used to directly identify the major agents involved in these processes, along with the uptake of 13C-urea into nitrifier biomass. The following two hypotheses will be tested:<br/>1. N2 fixation is a substantial source of new N in coastal waters of Southern California supporting export production. <br/>2. Forms of dissolved organic N, and specifically urea, can be substrates for nitrification and contribute substantially to regenerated production."

This project will design, build and validate a device that can be used at a hospital to create living heart tissue for repair of failing hearts and heart defects. Clinicians would inject a patient's own cells into the device, which would then automatically control the release of chemicals required to make living heart muscle.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on the hypothesis that a bioreactor containing a pump, heart matrix-based hydrogel, and nanoparticles controlling the timed release of differentiation factors can create a 3-D contractile cardiac tissue with organization and function similar to native tissue. To test this hypothesis, a closed-system bioreactor that pumps media through cardiac matrix hydrogels along with silica nanoparticles that release cardiac differentiation factors will be constructed and tested with human iPSC. The release of factors shown to eliminate pluripotent cells will purify the tissue and prevent the implantation of tumorigenic cells and this will be verified through PCR and immunostaining. Finally, tissues with suturable scaffolds will be generated and implanted into a rat model of cardiac defect repair. The broader educational and social impacts of this proposal are integrated with the intellectual merit and include outreach activities with several Houston high schools though the Rice K-12 Initiative to bring increased awareness of biotechnology, biomaterials and stem cells among high school students and increased participation of high school students in science & engineering."

How organisms respond to their physical and chemical and environment is a central question in marine ecology. For microbes living in the mesopelagic - the ocean's ""twilight zone"" - an efficient response is particularly important to capitalize on the intermittent delivery of organic and inorganic compounds sinking from the surface ocean. These organisms must have a suite of metabolic and regulatory strategies used to cope with environmental variability, but these strategies are largely unknown. Understanding when and why metabolic genes are expressed is critical to our understanding of nutrient remineralization in the ocean. Marine group 1 (MG1) archaea are ubiquitous, abundant microbes in the meso- and bathypelagic and promising model organisms for investigating these questions. MG1 archaea are chemolithoautotrophs that oxidize ammonia for energy and fix carbon for biomass, and as such, play a central role in the ocean's coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles. Though MG1 have historically eluded cultivation, recent efforts have been successful at bringing representative MG1 archaea from the open ocean into culture and demonstrating their importance in the production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. This project takes advantage of unique MG1 cultures and the recently sequenced draft genome of one of the organisms - strain CN25 - to investigate the physiological and transcriptional responses of MG1 archaea to variations in their chemical environment, specifically:<br/>1. Comparative transcriptomics of CN25 cells grown under a range of energy availability and nitrosative stress will identify select genes that can be used to diagnose the physiological state of natural populations<br/>2. Improvements in the genomic and transcriptomic knowledge of MG1 archaea will facilitate a thorough reinterpretation of existing metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets, as well as provide a better contextual understanding in future studies<br/>The investigators will conduct comparative transcriptomics of CN25 cells harvested in mid-exponential growth and stationary phase versus starved cells. Transcriptomes of cells grown at high nitrate concentrations and low pO2 with those grown in standard conditions will be characterized. A strand-specific, high-density RNAseq approach will be used to examine the expression of putative ORFs, polycistronic operons, and small RNAs, which, in addition to gene expression profiling, has the ancillary benefit of improving genome annotation. Finally, the investigators will sequence the genomes of two additional MG1 strains isolated from the open ocean, as well as single cells from environmental surveys, and leverage the combination with the CN25 genome to reanalyze available metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets. The results will define the transcriptional response of a model mesopelagic microbe to a range of chemical environments, and show how the physicochemical environment induces changes in gene expression and gene content that result in greenhouse gas production. This work will rapidly generate new knowledge of how some of the most ubiquitous, yet heretofore elusive, microorganisms respond to geochemical variability and shape our evolving understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The scientific and societal impact of the project will be to elucidate the mechanisms of greenhouse gas production in a model marine organism that is of broad interest to biological and chemical oceanographers. Transcriptome sequencing will improve the assembly of the CN25 genome, the first genome of an MG1 archaeon from the open ocean. Both the genome and transcriptomes will be important references for researchers using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics in the ocean, as these techniques are reliant on a knowledgebase composed of both DNA sequence and physiology. Thus, the results add value to both existing and future studies. The proposed research will advance education, teaching, and training for the next generation of marine scientists by providing support for two early-career investigators, one postdoctoral researcher, and a secondary school teacher."

The project is developing a novel geometric framework for modeling, structure detection, and information extraction from a collection of large related data sets, with an emphasis on the relationships between data.  While this approach clearly applies to data with a clear geometric character (e.g., objects in images), the work is also applied to datasets as diverse as computer networks (identifying common structure in subnets) and Massive Open Online Course homework data (automatically carrying grader annotations to similar problems in other students' homeworks).<br/><br/>The novel framework is based on the construction of maps between the objects under considerations (point clouds, graphs, images, etc...), and on the analysis of the networks of maps that result as a way of extracting information, generating latent models for the data, and transporting or inferring functional / semantic information. These tasks define a new field of map processing between data sets and require tool sets with new ideas from functional analysis, non-convex optimization, and homological algebra in mathematics, and geometric algorithms, machine learning, optimization, and approximation algorithms in computer science.  Sophisticated algorithmic techniques for attacking the large-scale non-linear optimization problems that emerge within the framework will also be investigated."

One area of particular importance is the reconstruction of genomes (haplotypes) from a viral population, which is a fundamental problem in virology, evolutionary biology, and human health. Though there have been several methods developed to take advantage of NGS data, those are limited to populations for which a reference genome is available. This excludes many important cases, such as RNA viruses or certain HIV/HCV viral populations. In such situations, the haplotypes are sufficiently divergent as to render the reference meaningless. Moreover, most algorithms are not robust in the presence of recombination, which is a common occurrence in many viral populations. The achievement of this project's aims will allow for the full potential of NGS data to be realized in the field of virology. In particular, it will help to propel the understanding of viral population dynamics and give biologists powerful tools to understand disease progression and enable novel treatment and prevention strategies.  The algorithms and software developed will be made freely available for use through software sharing platforms like GitHub or Galaxy. The PIs will offer a strong educational component including (a) graduate and undergraduate classes that use the output of the proposed research, and (b) development of a seminar series. The PIs will (a) train future generations of scientists and engineers to enhance and use bioinformatic/genomic cyber resources; (b) facilitate creative, cyber-enabled boundary-crossing collaborations, including those with industry and international dimensions, to advance the frontiers of science and engineering and broaden participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project?s aim is to develop probabilistic De Bruijn graphs and network flow on such graphs for the reconstruction of viral population when a reference is not available. Given NGS data, the algorithms should determine the number, sequences, and relative frequencies of the haplotypes.  This project's proposed algorithms are based on a unique combination of established techniques (e.g. maximum likelihood, expectation-maximization, clustering, Lander Waterman statistics) with novel propositions for probabilistic De Bruijn graphs, machine learning, and network flows that are of interest in other applications.

There is a clear need for new directions in science literacy. Over the past decade, the National Center for Education Statistics has consistently identified poor reading and writing skills as a serious problem, one which undoubtedly contributes to low science achievement. In addition, written and oral communication skills have been identified as a significant dimension of science practice and education. Secondary school, the focus of this workshop, is a critical period when students first experience a separation between subject matter and literacy. The resulting disciplinary silos may create discontinuities in students' learning of both science content and literacy skills. It may be advantageous for instruction in science and the English language arts to be brought closer together at the secondary level, and to facilitate this through digital learning environments. <br/><br/>Secondary science education has benefited from a range of digital technologies, including computer supported collaborative learning systems (CSCL) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS).  The hypothesis motivating the workshop is that results from a decade of work in computer-based learning for science and inquiry can be applied to science literacy. One precondition is appropriate application of automated techniques to analyze the texts that students read and write, so as to provide students with tailored feedback in an online setting. A second precondition is to apply insights from the psychology of education on the acquisition of general literacy skills, and argumentation skills in particular, to foster evidence-based communication. The workshop includes researchers from the three critical areas of computer-based learning environments, natural language processing, and the psychology of education. It has three main goals. The first is to share results, datasets and demonstration systems in order to identify the potential for collaborations that would both deepen the analysis of existing data, and identify criteria for the collection of novel datasets that specifically address science literacy. The second workshop goal is to foster collaborations among researchers in the three disciplines, with participation from practitioners, to study the potential impact on students' learning of science literacy skills.  The third workshop goal is to identify mechanisms to foster an interdisciplinary community that will continue to investigate science literacy."

The research program has a strong multidisciplinary collaborative component, with key team members drawn from biostatistics/statistics, computer science, psychiatry, radiology, and psychology. The tools and software under development can have immediate impacts in clinical research, and have wider applications in medical studies of HIV/AIDS, major neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, normal brain development, and cancer, among many others. The problems addressed are also of broad interest to general society, since they relate to pressing issues such as health care policies and social security planning.<br/> <br/>With modern imaging techniques, many large-scale studies have been or are being widely conducted to collect a wealthy set of functional data and clinical data. Functional data share four common and important features: (i) extremely high dimensional, (ii) piecewise smooth, (iii) temporally, and (iv) spatially dependent. The analysis of such data and integration of them with clinical data have been hindered by lack of effective statistical tools and theory, underscoring the great need for methodological and theoretical development from a statistical perspective.  The project addresses challenges from three broader perspectives in both time and frequency domains. The first perspective develops spatial-temporal models for adaptive function estimation. The models can effectively extract informative markers from noisy functional data. The second perspective concerns reduced rank models for groups of functional data with spatial-temporal correlation. In addition, the third perspective develops advanced functional mixed effects models for modeling varying association function between repeated functional responses and a set of covariates of interest, while accounting for complex spatial-temporal correlation."
